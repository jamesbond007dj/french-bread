one-piece,"Don't let the odd art style or ridiculous number of episodes deter you from watching this masterpiece. There will never be a boring moment. You will experience some of the greatest laughs and feels from this series. Just when you think you have the characters figured out, they surprise you. Oda never forgets a single one of the characters that he creates and neither will you. You don't just watch One Piece. You live it alongside the crew as they sail on the open seas on their grandiose adventure.",4.5,"['Nov 1, 2013', 'Oct 31, 2013', 'Oct 31, 2013', 'Nov 2, 2013', 'Oct 31, 2013', 'Oct 31, 2013', 'Jul 28, 2015', 'Nov 2, 2013', 'Jan 4, 2015', 'Mar 2, 2017', 'Nov 2, 2013', 'Oct 31, 2013', 'Jul 27, 2015', 'Nov 1, 2013', 'Jun 4, 2016', 'Jun 7, 2015', 'Jul 30, 2014', 'Jun 14, 2014', 'Nov 1, 2013', 'Oct 31, 2013']"
one-piece,"One Piece can simply be defined as: constant adventure. It has a truly amazing cast of characters that you will come to love as you learn about their stories and watch them grow. One Piece is a fantastic adventure with epic fight scenes, imaginative characters, wild landscapes, and unforgettable music. You will laugh, cry, feel anger, sadness, and joy as you make your way through the Straw Hats' epic quest. This is the story of Monkey D.

one-piece,"One Piece is simply the greatest anime of all time. When I first read Crunchyroll was adding it to their streaming library, I thought it was a joke, too good to be true. Then, after making sure that no one was pulling some sort of cruel prank on me I jumped for joy. One Piece combines every aspect of an amazing anime into it one ultimate experience for anyone who enjoys the medium. Every character is perfect, well developed, and gets their moment in the spotlight at least once, no matter how minor. One Piece can do anything it wants to, seamlessly transitioning from a comedy into a tear jerker in the space of one episode. I could go on for hours about the level of absolute perfection this show has achieved, but I'll keep myself contained and end at this: WATCH IT. YOU WILL HAVE NO REGRETS.",5,"['Nov 1, 2013', 'Oct 31, 2013', 'Oct 31, 2013', 'Nov 2, 2013', 'Oct 31, 2013', 'Oct 31, 2013', 'Jul 28, 2015', 'Nov 2, 2013', 'Jan 4, 2015', 'Mar 2, 2017', 'Nov 2, 2013', 'Oct 31, 2013', 'Jul 27, 2015', 'Nov 1, 2013', 'Jun 4, 2016', 'Jun 7, 2015', 'Jul 30, 2014', 'Jun 14, 2014', 'Nov 1, 2013', 'Oct 31, 2013']"
one-piece,"This anime is a pretty long series. I have watched countless hours of this anime and i must say it just keeps getting better. At first the animations are a little weak and they look pretty young but with the ""new world"" look they look clean cut and older. This anime does a great job on character developement you will come to know the whole crews past life experiences and is a great anime to watch.

one-piece,"One Piece is a classic, the anime has lasted over 13 years, why has it lasted so long?One of the reasons is the characters, all of the characters have a touching backstory, you get attached to them and want them to succeed. They help people, they joke around, they struggle, they grow, the characters are truly what makes One Piece a show you want to watch. The story is another reason people continue to watch it, who hasn't dreamed of adventure and exploring? He wants to be pirate king and because of that he gets to meet people and have fun and change the world. He's not stuck abiding by the law when the law is wrong, he does what is right and that leads to a lot of trouble often. But we cheer him on because he's doing the right thing, much like people like Batman, he does what is right in his own way. The battles are another reason One Piece has continued so long, Oda comes up with fantastic Devil Fruit powers, which lead to thrilling fights. Sometimes the abilities are silly, other times they are just plain terrifying. Seeing how Luffy and the crew deal with their new adversaries and try to save people, makes the show so addictive to watch. Now that I've covered some of the good things about the series, I will mention the cons.The series starts off with a lackluster art style, as expected for most older anime shows, the characters (definitely not talking about Ussop /sarcasm) can be annoying at times, and there is the typical anime fact there is always a stronger opponent. Basically if you like shonen anime, you will probably like this show, if you like more mature and serious anime (seinen anime) then this probably won't be for you.",5,"['Nov 1, 2013', 'Oct 31, 2013', 'Oct 31, 2013', 'Nov 2, 2013', 'Oct 31, 2013', 'Oct 31, 2013', 'Jul 28, 2015', 'Nov 2, 2013', 'Jan 4, 2015', 'Mar 2, 2017', 'Nov 2, 2013', 'Oct 31, 2013', 'Jul 27, 2015', 'Nov 1, 2013', 'Jun 4, 2016', 'Jun 7, 2015', 'Jul 30, 2014', 'Jun 14, 2014', 'Nov 1, 2013', 'Oct 31, 2013']"
one-piece,"I have been watching one piece ever since I saw it first air on 4kids TV and Toonami. I have kept up with it throughout the years and must say it is a great anime. However I feel as of late that the anime has begun to become extremly drawn out. I don't know if it is my imagination but I don't remember the series taking so long to progress. I mean lately it appears as if what could be accomplished in one or two episodes in the past, is now three, four, or even five episodes. Do not mistake, however, and think that I do not like this anime. Besides the long, drawn out episodes, this anime has it all: action, comedy, adventure, amazing fight scenes, and heart wrenching moments Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hidewhen they change ships for those of you who know what I mean.Though there is one other problem I do have with this anime. This is mainly directed to those of you who have seen past episode.... 500 or so? If you have not seen past that part I do not recomend opening the following spoiler, and will instead say that some of the anime's aesthetics have changed negatively IMO.  Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideAfter the bear dude (can't remember his name) pushed all the crew members around the world I feel as if I do not like the apparel or looks of some of the crew members anymore. While zoro, sanji, and ussop received some well deserved badass upgrades (maybe ussops's wasn't so well deserved, but oh well). I don't feel right when I look at all the other characters. Robin looked so much better before the time skip and both her and nami appear to have received a boob job sometime within the last three years. Also I don't quite like how chopper and ""soul king"" have become so.... plush... Lastly, I understand why they did it to franky but I can't stand looking at him now. I feel as if they went a little overboard on ""cyborging"" him up. Thank you for taking the time to read my review.

one-piece,"Alot of people including myself were really skeptical about starting one piece, for me the main reason was the art. I really didn't like it at all. But I ended up watching it anyhow and in the end I fell in love with it.The anime has fantastic characters, and awesome story lines, and the best part unlike Naruto or bleach there is almost no filler in one piece. Not to mention One Piece is one of the most popular anime's in japan.

one-piece,"Amazing that its been 15years running now. I loved it from the beginning, and to be honest would not mind seeing it go for many more years. It really only feels like we've made it only a bit over half way through the tale, and its never been a dull moment.<Possible semi-Spoilers in the following paragraph>Its been absolutely a trip watching the characters grow and see them each follow their dreams. Its not only about finding One Piece, its about becoming the greatest Swordsman and finding All Blue. It's about drawing the greatest World Map, becoming a Brave Man of the Sea and all of the others' dreams too.

one-piece,"I'll list the bad aspects first as a warning, but there is definite merit in the good aspects of this series as well--which I list second. :)The BadDo NOT start watching this anime unless you realize first that there is a fairly large chance that it will end inconclusively. It has been running for almost 17 years (more if you've followed the manga) without having 17 years worth of plot to accompany it. The latest arc was 2+ years (3+ if you include the preface). Thing is, the pacing is slow because the anime industry feeds off that money and purposely encourages writers to make it that way (also the reason why Naruto Shippuden refuses to end despite the completion of the manga). For One Piece, there is an ending in sight, but the author (Oda) predicts it's about 10 years away--that's a 27 year series. Most who affectionately started watching this series in 1999 will be likely in their 40's by then with no time to actually watch the episodes as time and life take over. Even more, with Oda's health always in and out of question, there is even a chance that Oda may not be able to complete the series or may rush to create a quick end that may leave strings undone. Even more, some of the iconic voice actors are getting really elderly as well... (For example, Luffy's voice actor is 63+ years old and will be 70+ years old at the time of Oda's predicted ending; Brook and Franky's voice actors are about 60 as well). As sad as it is to say it (and I really hope it doesn't happen, obviously), but it's possible that some of them may not make it to the grand finale--which may mean having to adjust to new voice acting at some of the most crucial parts of the story. I mean, there is only one person who can voice Luffy and Franky. They're very unique voices.The GoodThat being said, One Piece is by far one of the most original stories I have seen in a while. The story itself is funny, tragic, adventurous, and actually really interesting. Even characters you suspect you might not like initially find a way to somehow worm their way into your hearts. The animation drastically changes from the first episode to the current one--but the change is so subtle over time that you don't realize it's happening until you go back and look. The bond that the crew has for their odd and mischievous captain is also very emotional at times--but definitely doesn't form overnight. Luffy has to painstakingly earn their trust, and once he has it, he enriches it through their adventures in search for the infamous ""One Piece."" What's also refreshing is that the crew over time learns that they can't always expect Luffy to take on the full burden of their adventures--that he will literally die or do things that shorten his life to protect those he cares for. So, they, they grow stronger to protect him as well. This is so refreshing from the standard single-character powerhouse who never needs assistance, and strengthens the characters' bond throughout the series--especially later when Luffy faces one of the greatest tragedies of his life that (for a short time) threatens to break his care-free spirit. In ConclusionSince I am VERY picky about the quality of anime I view, I'll admit that this is one of the more enjoyable series I have watched (other favorites being things like Gintama, Lupin III, Yu Yu Hakusho, and Cowboy Bebop--though albeit each very different from one another). I've really enjoyed it, but recently life has begun to get in the way and I find that I grow tired of waiting years for arcs to clear. Lately especially, it takes some enjoyment out of it--especially with the pacing of the last arc. But, if you are just starting out, it's easier to watch because you can skip repetitious shots and unnecessary flashbacks without fear of catching up too soon--though admittingly, the growing number of episodes is often intimidating for many potential viewers. In truth, I may have never started watching this series myself if I had realized it was the Never-Ending-Story. While I don't regret it, I do fear sadly that it will likely end up being cancelled before completion if Oda's health continues to remain poor or if they drag it out 10 more years as Oda suggested.",4,"['Nov 1, 2013', 'Oct 31, 2013', 'Oct 31, 2013', 'Nov 2, 2013', 'Oct 31, 2013', 'Oct 31, 2013', 'Jul 28, 2015', 'Nov 2, 2013', 'Jan 4, 2015', 'Mar 2, 2017', 'Nov 2, 2013', 'Oct 31, 2013', 'Jul 27, 2015', 'Nov 1, 2013', 'Jun 4, 2016', 'Jun 7, 2015', 'Jul 30, 2014', 'Jun 14, 2014', 'Nov 1, 2013', 'Oct 31, 2013']"
one-piece,"And now I'm borderline obsessed with this story and where it goes. Don't let a first glance at the unconventional art style put you off; it will never seem out of place once you start it up. Oda masterfully has OP take itself very seriously while not taking itself seriously in the slightest, simultaneously and it works! The world building is fantastic, character designs are unforgettable, and while the story becomes increasingly complex, it never feels convoluted. Its core themes are friendship, loyalty, and the relentless pursuit of one's dreams, but it also creatively tackles issues such as racism, classism, government corruption, religion, etc. Even the fillers are interesting!
