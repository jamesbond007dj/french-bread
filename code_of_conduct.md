### Communication

* Be respectful.
* Ensure one person speaks at a time and is able to finish a thought. Aka don’t cut each other off.
* All communication handled either via Slack or in person.
* Try to make sure everyone is included in all discussions.
* Be clear about what you’re actively working on and which files you’re working in.

#### Conflict Plan

If there’s a disagreement, discuss for 10 minutes, if there’s no majority agreement after 10 minutes, let a TA or JB decide.

If you disagree, clearly state why. “I don’t like this idea” is not a valid disagreement.

#### Git Process and Merge Conflict Plan

Keep individual feature branches. Naming convention for branches is your_name-feature. Work in feature branch and push to staging branch.
Only merge into staging branch. Merge into master only when MVP is met.

* Master branch - Presentation ready code
* Staging branch - the branch where we upload the working code before merging it to master.
* Feature branches - Our branches with our names,We can use semantic names also, but the name of the developer should go first. the branches where we are actually writing and testing code.
  * Naming convention for feature branches is your_name-feature
