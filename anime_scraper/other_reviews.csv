my-hero-academia,"It is Here! This is the future of the Shonen genre. The bringer of the next generation. The creator of Naruto even promoted the series and said it was the real deal. It takes a profound and unique spin on the genre and has solid characters, an intriguing story and a fantastic soundtrack. Studio Bones is doing an excellent job with the adaptation as well. As a manga reader I'm very much looking forward to the future of this series.",5
my-hero-academia,"SHORT VERSION: This is one of the most thrilling and delightful anime of its era. It's even healthy for your brain. Just watch it.Some shows are solid but dull; some shows are enjoyable but unsubstantial. This series is solid enough but manages to be one of the most energetic, enjoyable viewing experiences I've ever had. I would not consider it the best anime ever made, but I might consider it the most flat-out enjoyable I've seen yet. The story is solid, the character designs quirky (obligatory pun)  and memorable, the music phenomenal (courtesy of Yuki Hayashi), but there's just a special soul to this one that elevates it above its peers. I was skeptical at first as it seemed like a somewhat cliche setup. In true shonen fashion, it spent a little while training up and then proceeded to completely obliterate my expectations. It took what I thought would be a tired story and breathed an overwhelming passion and life into it. It's filled to the brim with energy and heart, giving feels and frissons continually. It exemplifies the best of shonen: its messages of tenacity, crazy characters, thrilling battles, and sense of progression. It also avoids many of the problems typically associated with the genre, with (typically) better pacing and consistently spectacular animation. Studio Bones taking seasonal breaks between arcs to give them the time they deserve really gives this show an edge on its other cousins.Oh, and studies show that watching series where characters you identify overcome and win is actually healthy for your brain. Turns out, that thrilling feeling you get when your favorite character does something awesome or pushes through is your brain releasing certain chemicals to match them. And I've never seen a show that so consistently make me wanna stand up and cheer. This might be the most motivational thing you'll ever watch. NOW, GO BEYOND! PLUS ULTRA!",5
my-hero-academia,"Had you ever found your favorite anime was ended because they didn't make enough rating or out of budget? This is the one i'm actually hoping for that not to happen. I'd buy the whole company and the writer to make this to the last episode, non-stop. Soundtrack was very entertaining and really spot on with the main theme. Character developing quite slow, but then when its reach the momentum, it will start rolling fast.",5
my-hero-academia,"Potential SpoilersMinor spoilers from Season 1.Mentions of Season 2 with no context.Gently explained character personalities if that counts as spoiling.The BuildupThis show highlights the benefits of being a strong devout follower of improvement, and incredibly hypes up the audience (it had definitely hyped me up) with Midoriya's efforts. Emphasized by All Might's admiration, the fact that Midoriya was able to perfectly clear the beach alone truly built the character whom wants to move forward despite being told that he cannot. Instead of sitting back in admiration, he chases his dreams to become higher than those he admires because it sets him further in his goal to become a hero. Midoriya as a character motivates the idea of improving by visualizing the power of aspiration as he eliminates his obstacles; he moves forward and trains himself despite being ridiculed by his classmates and Bakugo, who he looked up to, in the first half of Season 1. Furthermore, Midoriya successfully demonstrates his purpose of being a hero: to help others, especially during the entrance exam, and especially during the attack of the villains.The buildup of Midoriya's character in this show is very consistent and while it may be slightly cliche, it doesn't get old, not to mention how Midoriya doesn't have those cringy motivational scenes like many other main characters from other anime who have similar goals.Ratings if I were to be honest:Characters: 10/10Midoriya's character is especially well done, and the same can be said for the secondary characters such as Bakugo, Ochaco, Iida, and Todoroki. As far as the characters with a significant impact to the story, their development is spot-on in my opinion. Even side characters have consistent and lovable personalities.Story: 9/10 The story accompanies the other aspects of the show with a decent storyline. The main character has a goal to achieve that he cannot naturally complete like his peers, but continues to try and gets closer to succeeding. The main character also somehow moves forward despite the drawbacks. I think this is slightly cliche, but original stories tend to be harder to come by with the more shows and stories that come out each year, so the rating doesn't lose more than one point. I think the key to having a good story isn't about originality, but the execution of the story. Midoriya succeeds a lot by chance, again like most other characters, but he acknowledges that and takes it as his own responsibility to improve despite the positive outcomes (Shown in Season 2, you'll know what I mean when I say this). So his advancement isn't just pure nonsense, but it's explained throughout. Also, he doesn't randomly control his powers one time but then fails the other times. For example, he throws with the power of one finger, but still breaks his finger, and his perfect punch was luck, but the circumstances were well explained later.Voice Acting: 10/10I really love how the voices easily match the speaker's personality. Bakugo has an aggressive way of speaking, emphasizing superiority and arrogance, whereas Midoriya speaks lightly with a slight submission, emphasizing caution and awkwardness.Art/Design: 10/10 The art is fairly high quality and consistent, there are rarely any misplaced details or disproportion.In ConclusionAltogether, I know that, even without reading the manga, this anime is definitely going far. Season 2 is already very promising, and I look forward to seeing the rest of this anime through.",5
my-hero-academia,"Ok so I kept saying I wouldn't watch this show because I wasn't crazy about the animation.....but...finally after everyone wouldn't shut up about it, I decided to give it a go. I was hooked by episode one, of course. Just like famous anime protagonists Naruto, Gon, etc., Midoriya is a character that you just can't help but fall in love with. The other characters are developing well too and the fights are awesome. I can't wait to see Midoriya grow as a character. I definitely recommend.",5
my-hero-academia,"I was browsing C.R. for kicks and I saw this one and figured, okay, I'll give it a shot. I had heard zero about the manga and zero about the show, so this was a fresh new world to delve into. Three days in and I finished up season 2 ep 21 and I'm eager for more. Easy binge and easy to get hooked on. Good storytelling and characters that are likeable. There's nothing about this show I don't like. Everything seems to flow well in the episodes and I'm generally interested in the backstories of characters. Well worth the watch.",5
my-hero-academia,"If ""X-men"" and ""Sky High"" had a Japanese love-child, this would be it. With high schools for teens with superpowers called ""quirks"" training to become heroes and fight bad dudes.If you like:- Goofy characters- Fun, typical, cheezy storyline- BADASS fight scenes- A nerdy main character who cries a LOT but fights like a BEAST- and UNITED STATES OF SMASH!Then you'll love this anime. Plus Ultra.",5
my-hero-academia,"Does an anime have to be completely original, to be a masterpiece? Should the story be unpredictable for it to be good?I don't think so.There is beauty in simplicity.The portrayal of every single component of the specific fictional world is the most important point in creating a series.Despite having your typical shounen, (young boy has a dream he wants to achieve so he has to overcome many obstacles on its way despite being an underdog in comparison to many other characters) this series does everything right so far. It does not try to hard with its plot, but still offers a big cast of interesting characters and a story where you can understand and share your feelings with the protagonist.Reaching episode 34, this work woke my feels more than any other series I have seen yet.  The solid art and the emotion generating sounds make a great deal of a this simple, yet for me perfect story.",5
my-hero-academia,"I admit, I was extremely skeptical about this anime. I saw the 5 star reviews, I heard it was recommended by the creator of Naruto but when I saw the art and the first episode, I just didn't get it. I could not have been more wrong.This is...Sky High (old movie some may remember) meets X-Men. Its an incredible story with great characters and although the animation isn't always the best, the fights are really fun to watch unfold. The story is unfolding perfectly and character development is being handled expertly. I can't wait to watch more and I recommend this to anyone. An easy 5 Stars.",5
my-hero-academia,"I got my brother, who doesn't like anime, to get hooked on this! Had him hooked on it since season 1 was released.. That should be enough to make you want to watch it already. This will instantly become one of your favorites if not #1. We are both super excited for Season 4! PLUS ULTRA!Every character in this series is so ""Quirky"" that brings a special individualism to each one :P. The story leaves you in great suspense and theories just keep popping into your head. This was a genius setup as the author can literally do ANYTHING he wants this story. Still the great feel as most of the top shonen, but in a world so unique and an MC that draws out your emotions. This series would turn a lot of non-anime watchers into fans..Enjoy~",5
my-hero-academia,"i went to store and started walking down the pristine aisles, i noticed a small jar with the word ""happiness"" written on the side. I picked up the jar and brought it to the counter, i payed for it and went to the parking lot.In the parking lot i opened the jar and inside was the most beautiful thing i had ever seen, it was Darling In The Franxx. But yeah bnha is very good 10/10 would recommend",5
my-hero-academia,"My Hero Academia.This series has sat in my queue for a couple months before I got around to trying it out.I'm a bit angry at myself for not giving this series a chance for so long. Lately, I've been watching many low quality series leaving me with bitter disappointment in anime in general. To have let this sit in my queue for so long is unforgivable.Simply put, it is amazing. I haven't had these gleeful feelings since first watching Naruto back in the early 2000's. It is a must watch. A required watch.If you're unsure of the series and have let it sit in your queue as well, I highly recommend watching the first four episodes. I guarantee by the end of the fourth, you'll be spurred forward in wanting to see how everything unfolds.Come, Young Midoriya. This is your hero academia!I get goosebumps and a little teary eyed just thinking about that ending. The music was in sync and just perfect.10/10 Go beyond, plus ultra!",5
my-hero-academia,"Through season 3, I can confidently say this is the best shonen I have ever watched. The voice acting is incredible, especially from Deku in the Muscular fight. The animation is also incredible. I love their take on developing their characters and quirks. There was only one pointless/filler episode in 3 seasons so far. A lot of shonen are packed with them. The music scores are also incredible. They will stick in your head. I am looking forward to the future of this series.",5
my-hero-academia,"At first glance, this show seems like just one more addition to a sub-genre flooded with clichés.  DON'T LET IT FOOL YOU.  My Hero Academia takes this sort of story to the next level, consistently surpassing my expectations and getting me more invested in an anime than I've been in years.  Instead of inverting the tropes shonen is known for, this show surrounds and supports them with elegant scaffoldings of motivations and plot points that change the tone of the old, familiar tale from tired to thrilling and remind us that it's the details that make or break a show.  In particular, I'm impressed by the creator's ability to keep all the characters' differing motivations in mind and ensure that they always act in accordance with what's driving them.  This is a very powerful storytelling tool and one that's, sadly, often subsumed into the ""hive mind"" in typical large-cast anime.  This show not only avoids that trap, it somehow keeps the viewer aware of each character's perspective, even in ensemble scenes, which leads to an extremely rich viewing experience.My Hero Academia is by far the best example of its kind that I've seen.  It's ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"" as sung by Whitney Houston.  I'm so, so glad I gave it a chance.",4
my-hero-academia,"Usually I don't like a lot of animes and am found very picky when it comes to the shows I like but HOLLY CRAP THIS ANIME IS GOOD! So far, this anime has pretty solid character backgrounds and designs and even a well crafted plot. Truly, out of all the episodes and seasons so far, my favorite has to be season two and I am expecting get intentions to this anime. I want to refer this anime to Naruto: a simple underdog who fights his way to the top of the charts and this series shows one of the best origin stories I have ever seen/hear. This anime gives me a lot of motivation to fight towards my goal and to overall be happy with the things that you have been blessed within your life!",5
my-hero-academia,"Let me start off with saying that this show is amazing. Boku no Hero Academia, or rather My Hero Academia is the new hot shounen series. This show gets a lot of things right, but it's not perfect either. The first season was rather slow and didn't really introduce us to the characters, but trust me when I say this - the second season totally made up for that problem. The characters were all amazing, and especially one character finally got his time to shine. Our main character Izuku or Deku (whatever you wanna call him) still amazes me, he is not the typical ""whiny"" character, and I can't wait to see him develop even more. The animation was done by well known studio Bones, also known for other popular shows like Fullmetal Alchemist and Noragami. The animation was good, but it was kinda expected I guess? For the music we currenly have 3 openings, and all 3 are amazing (even though my favorite is the second one, Peace  Sign) but I never felt like there was any piece in the soundtrack that stood out to me, maybe my taste in music is just bad?I have conflicted feelings on this show, because I feel like it is too ""over hyped"", I see why it's great, but I wouldn't go out of my way to say this is like a gift from god. I did enjoy this show a lot and I do recommend it. If you like action then what are you waiting for? Therefore, I rate Boku no Hero Academia a solid 7,88 out of 10 and recommend you to watch the heck out of this show. (Please accept that this is my opinion, so don't feel offended in any way, thank you for understanding.)",5
my-hero-academia,"My Hero Academia has delved into some dangerous territory:Multi-episode fightsTournament arcsMain characters that are introduced very lateAnd NEVER ONCE was is boring or cliche.When I found out that season two of this show would heavily focus on a singular tournament I was ready to begin crawling out of my skin as I watched episode after episode of the same two days or so and god did this show come in clutch. The tournament arc was amazing and fun and I was actually sad when it ended. The fight scenes are long, but never dull which makes them a pleasure to watch. The characters all have interesting and captivating backstories and motivations.Nothing in this show has disappointed me and, from the way things are going, I don't think anything will.",5
my-hero-academia,"I've been told by my sister and a friend about this show, and to be honest, I can't remember the last time I was so thrilled and engaged into a fictional world that I would watch it (almost) non-stop, and then pick up the manga and get up to date with the events. It could have been when I read The Count of Monte Cristo, or the Sherlock Holmes stories for the first time; all I gotta say is that My Hero Academia is one of the best shows I have ever seen. The characters are well built, the story is immersive and the soundtrack is bonkers.",5
my-hero-academia,"I'll keep this short and simple. Going into this, I thought, ""How could it be better than One Punch Man?"" Well its not better than One Punch...BUT! It's an amazing piece of work. Its Pacing is near perfect to me, Allowing you to watch the steady growth of character development. Instead of watching a hero be a hero, You get to watch the start of a legend. The characters are all very well designed as well. They feel pretty fresh compared to a lot of other anime characters. Don't get me started on the art style. Its all too good, and I feel any shonen lover will quickly find what they love about shonen here.",5
my-hero-academia,"thought it was going to be another good start, bad end series like SAO, but man was I surprised. The character development is great and realistic, tackling things like peer pressure, Eugenics, and rivalries all within a school setting without the school being the only setting. The arcs are great, each with its own plot, setting, buildup and finale, while at the same time setting up the next arc nicely without leaving out key elements of the current plot, as other anime tend to do with bad cliffhangers.The heroes themselves are great, varied, have unique powers, and explained backstories, along with the villains. Nothing is too cheesy or hammed up, sort of like the villains from One Punch Man in that though they all look silly, everyone of them is a murderer.The best way i can describe My Hero Academia for the new viewer is that it reminded me a lot of the first season of Naruto, in which the main character can't control his power, his main rivals are hotheaded and powerful, and they are rather quickly thrown into a situation with much more powerful enemies than they can handle. The flow of the story is much better, though, and the exposition is toned down more.Watch up to the episode of the Entrance Exam, and you will know if you will like it or not, as the series fights only get more intense after that. I guarantee you that you will not be disappointed after watching this through, Such a emotional rollercoaster.",5
my-hero-academia,"My Hero Academia is an amazing show filled with action and adventure and a some touches of sadness here and there. You'll fall in love with every character (except Mineta). It's a classic villain VS super hero anime. And it's quite a wholesome and very well done. It is also inspiring to people who think they are nothing and want to be great. It shows that anyone can be a hero even if they don't have any special gifts. It has a great message that will encourage people to keep going.Go Beyond, PLUS ULTRA! Shoto Todoroki is my favourite because we both kinda have the same past. (Except being burned though.)",5
my-hero-academia,"I'm fairly new to anime but despite that, My Hero Academia is one of the best stories I've ever indulged in. I was roped in with an interesting world that I wanted to learn more about. As I was watching the show I grew to love and appreciate this masterpiece, and it gave me an escape from the rough times I was going through. Right now I'm anticipatedly waiting for the next episodes to come out so that I cheer my favorite heroes on through their thrilling journey.",5
my-hero-academia,"I have watched 3 whole animes in my life: Attack on Titan, One-Punch man, and My Hero Academia. I think I'm being polite when I say My Hero Academia blew both of the other two out of the water completely. It has such a good plot, and the animation in this series is great! I'm very ready for season 4 to be completely release so I can go on another binge-spree. I highly recommend this show, it's flat out amazing.",5
my-hero-academia,"Anime's take on super heroes, who of course from some reason are all going to school.The main character, tone, and overall story are great. It hits all the shonen stereotypes pretty hard, but does them well. It also does a good job of building an ensemble of interesting supporting characters. Last but not least, there are some superbly animated scenes and powerful moments that really pull out all the stops.The only real con that comes to mind, is the hero's main rival and childhood buddy/bully. Not sure where the creators come up with these type of characters, he's frankly just ridiculous, doesn't really add much to the show, and wastes a fair amount of screen time now and then. Just feels like a creative miss.",5
my-hero-academia,"I was very hesitant to start this series at first because I was told that it plays out like Naruto, which I'm not really into.However, this was not really the case.I love this series so much, the character design, their personalities and powers are all very interesting and new ones are being introduced at a great rate.The pacing for the series is great, I am always excited to see what's going to happen next. Many of the battles and problems that arise in the series will draw you in and make you anxious to see how they unfold.the only thing they need to change is Mineta, who is possibly the absolute most horrible and unlikable character ever created in the history of anime.",5
my-hero-academia,"This was one of the first anime shows I looked at, and most of the shows I watched before were not as mind-grabbing or world changing as My Hero Academia. This show's use of music and the animation was on point. Out of the anime I have watched, not many had a great OP, story, animation, ED, characters, powers, emotional moments, and villains/antagoinst. This show has it all. If you are not a huge anime person, you will like it. If you are an anime god, then you will love it. If you have heard any bad things from anyone, look at the first 2 or 3 episodes and then judge. My Hero Academia is worth it, and I can't wait for season four. Let's Go.",5
my-hero-academia,"In just a few seasons MHA has shown that its a force to be reckoned with. The writing is flawless, the character development is believable and relatable even. The action speaks for itself -  you just know the animators pour their souls into each scene. Bones Studios is delivering what anime fans have been wanting for years. This will leave the same impression on this generation like ""Naruto"" did for mine when it first came out. Absolutely looking forward to the future of MHA. If things continue to be this good this will probably break into most viewers top 5 anime lists easily.",5
my-hero-academia,"MemerableEven a year after watching the first 3 seasons I can still recall names and specific arcs. Though in my opinion, the Training Camp arc is the best. Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideJust like the USJ attacks and All Might defeating Nomu. This might not be a spoiler now but just staying safe.RewatchingI had finished the third season back in 2018, and now I'm back to watch it again in anticipation for season 4.First anime review don't judge.",5
my-hero-academia,"Someone else made a review here about My Hero Academia being good for you brain. I just want confirm that it really is.I was recommended this series by a friend, who mentioned that the music was awesome (it is), but I didn't really get around to watch it until I got really mentally broken down.Watching My hero academia during this time was the best decision I've ever made. No other series have successfully conveyed that kind of ideas to me before that this series do. It sounds cheesy, but the resolution of the second season may actually have saved my life. Or at least changed it for the better.I cannot state that enough. This show conveys message after message that I think everyone will need to hear at some point in their life, and the show does all that without feeling like it is force-feeding you.Also, it is darn masterpiece even without all that. The music is great, the VA is on-point, it is action packed and inspiring. Each episode leaved you longing for the next without it every feeling cheap. It breaks clichés over and over again. No matter if you feel good or bad right now, just watch it. It's simply plus ultra.",5
my-hero-academia,"Battle shonen, for how much I don't care for it, it's been there for many of the steps of my anime journey.Dragonball Z was an early anime for me back in the Toonami days, but I always had a strange resistance to the genre mainstays that would come after. However, on a bored day, trying out the manga, I decided I might give this a go. Why? Well, I'm a long time reader of American super hero comics. Seeing someone work to fuze the tropes of both American super heroes and Japanese battle shonen piqued my interest. As much as I was done with one's tropes, seeing a reinterpretation sounded interesting. Is it original then? No. Why would anyone expect something built on the tropes of two genres to be original? I see people complain about that. That's just silly. But it doesn't have to be original to be entertaining. And entertaining it is.You want original? Well, that ship sailed on story telling generations ago. If you think otherwise, you're just fooling yourself.",4
my-hero-academia,"An amazing series that pokes fun and subverts superhero tropes in the best way possible. The fights between villains and heroes can honestly go either way, and we are allowed to see heroes be vulnerable.There's a tournament arc that's not annoying filler and is exciting to watch. Minimum fan service, amazing OST, and an entertaining story. I honestly love (and sympathize) with all the character villains and All Might included. I know, I feel for the supposedly God-like character. Only an excellent series could make me do that. I can't wait to see Deku reach his full potential (and throw them hands at Bakugo). Anyway, a 10/10 series through each season (movie also). I can't wait to see how this series ends.",5
my-hero-academia,"IF anyone says that this anime is bad or good for a younger audience. Then you should know in a way they are correct. You see, towards the beginning of the show the animation and perspectives on the different problems is a less mature one. However, these people did also not give the show a chance and are missing out on a lot because of this. The show actually becomes mature and shows the creators excellent worldbuilding and character development skills. The show is very mature and deals with quite heavy themes that many adults have still not managed to figure out themselves. If you give this show even three episodes, you can begin to see the direction it is going in, and how the characters might mature. And, if any of the characters begin to seem redundant or cliche, then you will be proven wrong, in the way they develop. And if even then they still seem cliche, then you should at least realize how much more 3d they are than a lot of other shounin characters. Honestly, to the people who gave this a lower total grade have not given the show its time to show just how great the world and characters are. While this anime may not be one that goes on many peoples favorite lists, it is still greatly deserving of 5 stars. Each fight, character, plot point, arc, animation, art, music, and any other thing that you could think of that is important to an anime, is done with near perfection in this show. You cannot give this series enough praise. Please know that if the characters ever seem cliche, naive, or immature, give it time, and you will see just how good the show is, and how important the first episodes where to setting up the main character. If you still think this way, than you are probably are an edge lord who watches shows like ""akame ga kill"" because the deaths make it ""mature"".",5
my-hero-academia,"Going in, I was skeptical with the name and presentation, but the story line, artwork, character development, and progression is way beyond what I have seen recently.  This is 100% a show that will have you on the edge of your seat in some scenes and pulling tears from your eyes in others.    My Hero definitely does not pull its punches when it comes to the action sequences but the dialog is not lacking and equals out over the entire show.  This one is definitely on my rewatch list when the next season comes out.     Give this a watch.  You will not be disappointed.",4
my-hero-academia,"Quality battles with unmatched character development. Solid world building that leaves you wanting to learn more about hero society as it is displayed in this universe. Unlimited possibilities for quirks keep the battles refreshing and the dynamic between our main character, Deku, and his rival throughout the series, Bakugou, always leave you wanting to see how their relationship will progress. Looking forward to more episodes being released.",5
my-hero-academia,"Honestly this is an anime I've actually been keeping up with and It's something new to the Shonen genre. Best Shonen of all Time? Debatable. Best Shonen of the New Gen? Definitely! Nothing compares to My Hero Academia. Boruto, Seven Deadly Sins, and Black Clover all fail in comparison to My Hero Academia. My Hero Academia brings a new plot twist to the genre and Brings new character plots as well. Instead of using Aliens, Supernatural Beings, and Ninjas, My Hero Academia uses actual Superheroes like the concept came straight out of a comic book. Some people will say My Hero Academia is over rated, but This anime is at the top for a reason. Nothing is beating it at the moment and I doubt anything will for awhile. I give My Hero Academia a 5 out of 5 *'s",5
my-hero-academia,"Amazing Build-up This Show is one of my Favorites, it takes some  time to build up but is so worth it. If your looking for a storyline that builds the Characters and gives you a just the right amount of backgroud, but not overwhelming then this is the right show for you. It has the Drama, the Love the Action, the ????‍???? mistery that we all love in our Stories. If you want to know more about new shows and the ones that you must check out, Head over to my Page Blackstorm We would love to Darken your Taste. HAHAHA Blackstorm",5
my-hero-academia,"The main reason why I love the show is because it is an underdog type story, even if it's a shonen cliche I feel that it adds things to make it different from another like Naruto.The art style for me is amazing, unique just like all the characters the show offers. Each character has their moment to shine even though it is not as crucial compared to the main character it's what make the show more enjoyable. Fight scenes are pretty good especially season 2 (No spoilers) but compared to some other anime it isn't mindblowing (Choreography mainly). First season kicks the action off so it might not impress you so much, but if you continue to watch it until season 2 it will probably leave a mark, and you might even decide to watch until the anime finishes who knows?It's a good anime I would recommend it but that is your choice obviously.",5
my-hero-academia,I put off watching this anime FOR SO LONG for such a stupid reason.  On the cover art I was always seeing I saw Todoroki's face and I thought he was a dog person with a spot over his eye so I kept avoiding this anime.  For real.After FINALLY giving it a chance I found that was not the case at all and I am thoroughly and seriously impressed.  This show can bring tears to my eyes in almost every episode.  Not because it's sad or anything but the comradery makes me choke up.10/10 recommend to anyone who wishes they had superpowers.,5
my-hero-academia,"There are a lot of reviews here already that tell you why the show is good, which I completely agree with, so this review will be touching on some of the hater's reasons for hating on this show. Warning: Possibly some Minor Spoilers:Reason 1: The premise is typical - While a bizarre and unique plot can be awesome and really catch someone's attention, at the end of the day it's all about the execution. So many shows sound so great, but end up failing because the only thing good about it is basically just the premise. On the other hand MHA's premise might not be the most out of the box, however the execution is fantastic on just about every level: Deep characters, hits hard with emotions, big twists, great flow, amazing voice acting, animation, and music.Reason 2: MC is too whiney - People who say this don't seem to understand the MC's character at anything more than a surface level. First off he is not whiney, he is simply full of fear for good reasons. Our MC is powerless in a world full of superpowers as well as being short and scrawny, therefore he would be completely powerless against virtually any villain. Our MC isn't some downright oblivious head first MC like in so many other shounen's. He is incredibly smart and realistic and therefore fully understands his inabilities and the consequences of his actions, unlike any Shounen MC i've ever seen. If you were in his shoes can you walk about with fearlessness and confidence? If your smart like him, definitely not.I mentioned that he is incredibly smart and realistic, yet his goal is to be a great hero when he has no abilities. Sounds contradictory I know, but here's the thing: Our MC understands how foolish his dreams are, and he is too smart to believe himself either in the beginning. He is not chasing his dream because he really believes he can do it, but because for him there is no other path he is willing to follow. If there is even a 0.001% chance then he is willing to bet it all on his dream. That is why our MC chases his dream despite understanding better than anyone else how impossible it is. As the show goes on you might see that his fear and understanding of his inabilities actually elevates his character beyond any other shounen MC I have ever seen. He is full of fear and fully understands all the costs and risks, however for his ideals he is willing to face any fears and pay any cost. Incredibly inspiring to say the least.Reason 3: Characters are uninteresting Yes there are some characters that are not fleshed out, typical, and blah blah blah, but you can't be fleshing out every single character when there are hundreds of characters. The pacing and flow of the story would be ridiculous if that were the case. Most of the main ones are very deep and some of the villains are incredible as well. When a show is said to have great characters, it's not accounting for a bunch of side characters, but mostly the main ones and a few of the supporting cast.",5
my-hero-academia,"One look at the image of this anime and I was like pass. I don't watch this genre. It is just not targeted towards me! But I heard this was a good underdog story. Im a sucker for them so I decided to give it a try...Oh my... I don't know when but I am a total fan now. This is funny, emotional, has great character development this has everything you want in a great show. This will be in my top all time favorites.Now trying to stop fangirling around, I thought this would be full of boring filler all around but I was surprised. None so far, besides recaps but they are recaps at the start of a season when you need one.The art style took me a while to get use but its not bad, again not my genre! The story has a good pace and nothing seems to be rushed. The one thing I hate is that I binge watch the first two seasons and now I have to wait for new episodes. I would recommend this to everyone. This show is not over hyped. Im proof of it. It's overall one of the great ones all you need to do is give it a chance and it will steal your heart.",5
my-hero-academia,"Easily one of the best shounen airing.  Hands down.  Full Stop.I'd describe the seemingly cookie-cutter setup and over-played premise, but frankly that doesn't do the show justice.  The show is equal parts exciting, endearing, and immersive.  I don't think there's any aspect to the show or plot point (so far) that hasn't been done somewhere else beforehand, but I don't think it's ever been done quite so well or with so much passion.Everything from the art to voice acting, to writing, to story is just superbly knit together.",5
my-hero-academia,"If you enjoyed Shonen like Naruto, One Piece, Fairy Tale, Tiger and Bunny or The Seven Deadly Sins then your in the right place. In a world where abilities called quirks are everything our main character Izuku Midoriya wants to be a hero but has none, until luck finds him. The voice acting is spot on for each hero and villain. The heightened emotion will pull you in. Studio Bones makes use of cliffhangers and rarely uses filler episodes. This is an action packed anime you shouldn't miss.",5
my-hero-academia,"I'll list a few reasons why this show is in my opinion the greatest shounen out there:-The universe is amazing. I haven't seen anything TOO cliche, although thats kinda hard to avoid in an anime,  but it holds itself up well and the lore can get pretty deep.-The characters are great, each character has his own amazing personality, and you can clearly see the character development throughout the seasons-The artstyle is simply great, it displays clearly the emotions of each character and I love it.-The animation is extremely fluid, amazing quality.-The colors are bright and vivid, and gives great life to the show.-The villains, oh the villains. They're a big reason why I love the series: They are genuinely scary. Tomura Shigaraki legit gave me chills the first time I saw him.These are a few reasons why this is my favorite shounen and maybe the best. My opinion though, you might have a different one.-zuzur_",5
my-hero-academia,"What makes this anime so good is is that every aspect of this anime is extremely polished and refined. It's as if the Shounen genre was carefully nurtured by passing through the hands of many creators (just like One For All) and the result was My Hero Academia. However, this is precisely where the anime is lacking. Although refined, there doesn't seem to be much that makes this anime particularly special; there isn't some aspect of it that really pushes the limits of anime. However, it's undeniably interesting to watch and I look forward to the new episodes!",5
my-hero-academia,"best anime ive seen in  a while. binge watched from season 1 and sad i now have to wait for saturdays.awesome show. highly recommended to everyone to watch.great story and keeps you hooked.however i do wish the intro and outros weren't so long.(1:30 each) thats one element i dislike about animes, they always have way to long intro/outros. Make the episode seem short and in some cases it does make it short.",5
my-hero-academia,"TL:DR Watch this for the story even if you do not like the genre.  The tale is a wonderful blend of action and the coming of age for a group of students.Toradora, was the first five star anime that I wrote a review for on Crunchyroll.  The weaving of the narrative, the risks it took, along with the gut punching emotions and the willingness to allow other secondary characters to shine became the standard bearer that I compare other romance-slice of life-comedies to.My Hero Academia is going to do the same in different ways in this genre of Anime.The tale sound simplistic enough:  Its about the journey of a young man to become the best hero of his time.  In that journey he has trials, friends, rivals and enemies that he picks up along the way.But, after watching it, I realized that its the examination of the journey and not the end point. It goes into the mechanics of the how's and why's not just of the main characters, but the secondary and one off characters.  The world feels exactly how it is supposed to and not just limited by the school settings.  Watching the main character and secondary characters interact with one another and the world at large with their own individual and relatively complex backstories makes them realistic and it immerses the watcher into the story itself, never attempting to wink at the camera or go over the top.Everything happens for a reason, and keep a careful eye as you watch for the first time the subtle parts of the story.  There is an ebb and flow to the story arcs and with a few missteps (which will be in the spoiler section) work seamlessly and builds from one to another while giving the audience a chance to breath in the process.Every character in the main character's class is memorable, I may not remember  their names but if you showed me a picture I can tell you three scenes that they heavily contributed to the plot of an episode or the series as a whole (that's 20 characters).  The students all have goals and lives outside of the classroom, that are for the most part explained.  Each one is unique in their own right from the way they talk to the way they walk and have a story to tell.  While the main focus is on the protagonist every relationship happens organically and with a reason.The Teachers are adults!  This left me thunderstruck once I realized it.  They have their own quirky and sometimes goofy personalities, but they have the best interests in the instruction and the *safety* of the students.  There are rules and laws that the students must abide by to be safe and have real consequences; and everyone of them are practical and necessary for the society that they live.Actions in this story have consequences, and not all of them are pleasant.   There are heartwarming triumph and heartbreaking failures; and both sometimes happen at the same time. There is the complexity of unnecessary guilt, fatal flaws and choices that should have been better thought through (by students and adults alike), and none of this gets hand-waved away.  Instances that have no right answers occur and they have lasting effects forces characters to change physically and mentally.The art is detailed mixing western style and Japanese animation together and it is quality work that helps to immerse you into the world.  People walk differently from one another in the background and everything looks alive, with a few exceptions panning from scene to scene.The music especially the third op is very symbolic of the journey itself and I only found the third ending song to be found wanting and that was more of the setting of the symbolism.All in all a very satisfying and enjoyable show. (spoilers below this)Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hide  There was one thing that these guys did that almost knocked this down to a 4 star instead of a 5 star that is shown:  The last episode of the second season as a whole and the first three minutes of the first half of the second season.The last episode should have been the start of the third season.  It had no business being the last episode, as this felt like it was a cheap ploy for a third season.  The first of the second season wasted three minutes of time that could have developed the interpersonal relationships instead of being an overview of the last five minutes of the previous episode.  Heck this would have been better spent on Deku and his mother and the nervous breakdown she's about to have in the third season (which is part of the reason that I hated the ending of episode 38 is that is the only thing that is not really built up well).  Again that is my only main gripe against this story.Since there is a point of Deku overall succeeding that actually helped me relax and enjoy the story as it is, because as it is explained in its subtle way this is the study of the journey and not really the destination.Which brings me the Deku.  What a relief, to have a can-do attitude, have successes and setbacks that only make him more determined.  Compared to most angst silly main characters or big shots that need to be taken down, Deku is working through the struggle the best he can not having to learn the lesson of relying on others for support.  Even the shy romance that is budding doesn't stop him from asking Ochaco help or talking to her like an equal.Even in spoilers I won't go too much into it because quite frankly you owe it to yourself to watch the series.  You will not regret it.",5
my-hero-academia,"First off, this is by far one of the best series I've come across. At least by Shonen. I was never into One Piece, was off and on with Naruto and Bleach. But I am blown away by this show.The Characters are all unique and interesting. Each have their own motivation that is made perfectly clear. Few tropes here and there but those are completely overshadowed by everything else.Moving on to what I consider the best part of this series. Is the fact you can clearly see how much influence DC and Marvel had on this series. Can plainly see how many characters are similar and how much of a fan Kōhei Horikoshi is of Western comics. From Mina and her influence from Scott Ridley's Alien. If none of you have seen Alien, drop what you are doing and watch it right now. Then after that learn about H.R. Giger and his unique dark brilliance.Too Tsuyu and her influence coming from X-Men, specifically Toad.The series takes the concept of super heroes from comics, but instead of the minority being super, they're instead the majority. Taking what was a burden in comics and making everyone not have a burden of being a hero, but how they specifically fit into the hero role, or how they don't.Sorry if I went off topic. I'm just in love with this series and how much detail went into it. Even if people don't truly understand how much content there is behind the scenes.",5
my-hero-academia,"I don't know where to start. Great anime, great plot, great characters, great villains, overall amazing. What I like most about this is that it's not just some typical, everyday hero anime that the main character always wins their battles expect maybe one if that. He really struggles and he loses quite a bit, even the other characters lose a bit too. But, that is what I like because it keeps setting up for more and more character development between all of them and plus it's more relate able since he and the others are still very inexperienced. It's truly great and I am always looking forward to the next episode to come out. I'm very glad that it didn't stop at 12 or 24 episodes. I hope it keeps going.",5
my-hero-academia,"I thought it was going to be another good start, bad end series like SAO, but man was I surprised. The character development is great and realistic, tackling things like peer pressure, Eugenics, and rivalries all within a school setting without the school being the only setting. The arcs are great, each with its own plot, setting, buildup and finale, while at the same time setting up the next arc nicely without leaving out key elements of the current plot, as other anime tend to do with bad cliffhangers.The heroes themselves are great, varied, have unique powers, and explained backstories, along with the villains. Nothing is too cheesy or hammed up, sort of like the villains from One Punch Man in that though they all look silly, everyone of them is a murderer. The best way i can describe My Hero Academia for the new viewer is that it reminded me a lot of the first season of Naruto, in which the main character can't control his power, his main rivals are hotheaded and powerful, and they are rather quickly thrown into a situation with much more powerful enemies than they can handle. The flow  of the story is much better, though, and the exposition is toned down more. Watch up to the episode of the Entrance Exam, and you will know if you will like it or not, as the series fights only get more intense after that.",5
my-hero-academia,"Review for season 1 after 7 episodes. While what others say about this anime being predictable, and full of tropes we've seen before is true, these things are all woven together and executed so well that it all kind of just ""works"".  Like, an updated roller coaster, you can kind of see the twists and turns this anime will take from quite a distance away. However, like a really kick ass roller coaster, that won't really matter because you're going to be enjoying every second of this awesome ride. If anything having a feeling of what's coming only makes those big moments that much more compelling. Characters are relatable, likeable, and full of charm. This is a great anime and I cannot wait to see what season two has in store.",5
black-clover,"Before I watch any anime and invest my time in them.. I read the reviews.. and for Black Clover I saw all the negativity on here about Asta's voice (the main character) ... I immediately judged the anime and didn't even give it a chance when I heard his voice. I literally couldn't watch more than 5 minutes of the show.. After a few months later and me not having anymore good anime to watch.. I decided to give it another chance. I braced myself for the yelling... but as the story went on. I fell in love and Asta is one of my favorite characters in the anime. I highly suggest anyone that loves One Piece, Fairy Tail, or Naruto to watch this anime.",4
black-clover,"As someone who has read the manga, I will say this series does grow on you. It may have a generic start but I think it is fine to be inspired by your peers as Tabata-sensei (author) clearly has. That being said it does grow its own unique narrative as it progresses and has some very interesting characters as well. I believe execution is more important than originality in art forms these days. Just because a show is original, it doesn't mean its going to be good but a well executed show will always be good. Studio Pierriot has a challenge ahead of them but this series actually does have potential for greatness. Let's see where this goes.",5
black-clover,"I'm being lenient giving it a 4 when it probably deserves a 3 at this current moment, it's (FINALLY) trending in the right direction though, hence the 4 stars. I reserve the right to change my dang mind though if it drops the ball it took too long to pick up to begin with. Really the title explains it all though.The first three episodes are so slowly and badly paced that can be downright unwatchable. Episode 3 is nothing but filler that offers nothing to the story, which is nonsense the manga is 133 episodes in so really you can skip episode 3 entirely. Episode 4 is when things finally start to happen but by this point many can be really tired and give up and though Episode's 4 is better, its not so much better that it'll just grab your attention. Episode 5 might get your attention if you've found a way to slug yourself through this far. Episode's 6 and 7 were both really entertaining and the added bits actually add some extra context to this show that aren't in the manga.A lot of these problems are caused by old solutions to manga that are paced quickly. I never read Black Clover so when it came out as an anime and it started I was interested because I heard good things, but wasn't convinced to read the manga so decided to give the anime a try. After two episodes of 'dear god this is not good at all' I read the manga to see why people liked the manga so much and enjoyed it so much I binged what I think was 120ish chapters in 2 days. The manga is extremely fast paced and doesn't dwell on much, which lets it be a really fun read. It also makes it really hard to fill up a 24 minute episode every week when you could anime an entire chapter in for 10 minutes of time and the first few chapters don't have a lot of transition to one another. If you really want to give this a shot after hearing the mixed reviews here's my recommendation. Watch episode 1, Skim episode 2 (it's not as bad as 1 but gets old quick), skip episode 3 entirely it's just awful and you'll miss nothing, and watch 4 through 7. That would be my recommendation as of this moment.What happens in episode 3 you ask for those who read all this? The tow brothers leave town to join the 'magic knights' that are the central point of this show, rehashing some vastly overused and not that funny jokes, and do a bad montage of the two brothers traveling to the capital city. Episode ends. If you REALLY want to watch episode 3 watch until they leave, cringe a bit, and once they leave stop watching.Also, yes Asta's voice is unbearable but somehow it got way less obnoxious come episode 5 or 6, I forget which.",4
black-clover,This anime shows promise and i cant wait to see what kinds of powers Asta has to offer. He might be screaming for a huge percent of the episode but taking his age and some of his background history into consideration and you might understand. This anime needs time to unravel so lets not bash it just yet. I'm giving it a 5 out of 5 because i can see the greatness this could turn out to be.,4
black-clover,"Let's get the negative out of the way first. This show feels about a decade too late. Everything in the show has already been done before, and better. It tries to be like the oldschool shonen we grew up with, like Naruto and One Piece, to the point that many aspects of the show feel straight up stolen, namely the MC constantly saying he's going to become the Wizard King despite everyone else's disapproval, being a direct imitation of Luffy and his gosal to become the Pirate King. The MC himself is the generic, never-give-up, shonen protagonist, but with a twist: He never-stops-SCREAMING. EVER. You do get used to it after a while, but you can also get used to giving yourself paper cuts on the webs between your fingers. That doesn't mean it sucks any less. The animation is usually around average, but can dip HARD at times. I'm not usually one to even notice animation dips, but I found myself pointing them out very often with this show.Now I say all of this-but the show does have its merits. The rival dynamic between the MC and his childhood friend, Yuno, is actually very well done. Probably one of my favorites. And the lack of filler is GREAT. Even on some episodes that feel like filler are never without some purpose. One in particular I started almost certain it was going to be an uneventful filler episode, ended with a new girl being added to the MCs harem. Speaking of which the harem formation in this show is also fantastic. Every girl that becomes infatuated with the MC has believable reasons that make you feel like it isn't forced just for the sake of having a harem.The biggest grey spot for this show is, like I stated earlier, it feels a decade late.It's almost nothing but done-to-death tropes, but that is also a part of it's charm. It really feels like an old school anime that someone just unearthed one day and we're all just discovering it for the first time together. It really brings me back to the good old days of shonen anime when I was younger. All in all.... Eeeh. It's 'aight.",5
black-clover,"First off I don't read manga, but I have been avidly watching anime since 2009 when I got Internet for the first time so even non manga readers can enjoy this anime. haha(referencing a previous post saying you won't enjoy this anime if you're not a die hard fan)So far episode two and I'm somewhat entertained EXCEPT for the MC's incredibly annoying voice and screams. Let's hope this anime lives up to its potential. But seriously... I could understand if people pass on this anime solely because of the main character's screams. Lol",3
black-clover,"For those that are deterred from all the bad reviews, this show started out quite slow, and with not much going on. I continued to watch it and gave it a chance, now it has gotten much better with a whole lot more going on. The only downside is that episodes feel very short due to the same intro playing over and over taking up time. However, I'm REALLY enjoying it now and can't wait for more episodes to come out!",4
black-clover,"Exposition is ridiculous:* Asta repeats I'm going to be the wizard king once every thirty seconds.* We are told Asta cant use magic. We are shown Asta cant use magic. It is repeated every few minutes: ""just a reminder in case you forgot: Asta, you can't use magic""Instead of saying anything just once, it is repeated until you can't enjoy any dialogue. because the entire dialogue is repeated over and over and over. Everything is repeated over and over in this show. any of the top 5 plot events per episode is repeated 10x. Because none of us are smart enough to hear something once and remember it. Let alone any kind of great story telling that gets its points across without explicitly telling you things.The bloody screaming. Please. If it weren't enough that you shout"" I'ma gunna be the wizard king"" at noone in particular, his ONE OTHER LINE OF DIALOGUE is screaming. At nothing. All the time.",5
black-clover,black clover keeps getting better and better and better episode by episode. the current water temple arc is really good i love how each black bull is getting their time to shine. i can't wait to see what finral and vanessa have to show. i also love the main villian of this arc vetto there is much more to the eye of the midnight sun that needs to be shown. theyre shaping up to be a great villian threat,4
black-clover,"I like this show and I keep watching but each episode has so many obnoxious flaws.  I find myself wanting to see how the story progresses but the execution week to week is frustrating.Many of the problems have been mentioned continually.  It's derivative, full of cliches, the main character is loud/annoying, lots of stalling and filler tactics.  Those are generally true but they don't bother me as much what they have done with the supporting characters.  Most of the side characters are reduced to flat, canned one liners.  It feels like they didn't have dialogue in the script and someone improvised lines when they popped on the screen for the first time.  Then every time that character reappears they just say the same thing over and over with no development.  To make it worse they will often flash through several of these characters, multiple times per episode to burn screen time.I probably would rate this series 3 out of 5 but every episode makes me feel like I'm being poked in the ribs with a sharp stick to find out what happens next.",5
black-clover,"Overall this is a solid story that is presented with decent animation and poor voice acting (mostly from Asta, good freaking lord that screaming).The anime sticks to the manga pretty closely from my point of view, so I don't feel it's right to judge this series off of plot, that is not a problem here thankfully. I see the responsibility of anime, in this instance where it has manga as it's inspiration, is to take the original work and bring to life the source material in a way that only anime can, adding to the experience for both the seasoned manga fans as well as newcomers to the series. At the very least if you have never heard of this series before then the anime version of Black Clover needs to give you the same appreciation for the series that the manga version of Black Clover gives, and I really can't say this series does that. Overall, I have read the manga up to it's current chapter and have enjoyed the progression of Asta and the rest of the Black Bulls up to this point and I can say with full sincerity that there is nothing in the anime that makes me want to watch it every week that I can't get from going back and rereading the manga.This is worth watching if something better hasn't released first, definitely not a must-see-at-all-costs anime, not by a long shot.Side note: I'm so glad I'm not the only one that hates Asta's screaming, It severely annoyed me to the point of not wanting to watch past episode 2 almost.",4
black-clover,"...AAAAAAAA - introduction Asta style. This was supposed to be a new ""king of shonen"". Although I admit the story is not the worst thing I have seen, Black Clover is far beyond other classics of the genre. Its characters are mostly unenjoyable, annoying and not symphatic at all. It depends way too much on elements of other well known series. For example take a look at  Asta, the main hero, who seems to be some kind of mixture of Rock Lee (ass hard training), Nastu (carefree nature) and Ichigo (wanna protect everyone+that sword).. I have nothing against these things, but people who know other series will immediately see them in Asta so he loses his own unique personality. The only new thing is maybe the screaming, which I am not really a fan of...Two stars, one for the try, the other for the Marylin Manson cameo.",4
black-clover,"I am a bit let down by the studio when it comes to Black Clover. After watching 13 episodes, I see some good and some bad with the series as a whole.I do not think dismissing the show souly on Asta being annoying is enough to rate the series poorly. Don't get me wrong, the voice acting and the writers choice of dialog for him is absolutely, undeniably headache provoking. However, if you can look past the annoying character, they have developed an interesting world.The hierarchy system is an interesting comment on society where it takes certain stereotypes and blatantly rubs it in your face. I also enjoy the different ""factions"" within the Magic Knights. Each faction has their own set of personality traits and ideals in which they represent. I find this extremely telling to the character development for each character.The cinematography and animation is not bad, but not great. I would not put it on the list for best animation but I can appreciate their attempts. I do however, enjoy the individuality and design of each character's magic. I find this is where they put a lot of their design efforts into and fell short on the environment surrounding.I strongly believe that the fact that they tried to sell this as ""the next Naruto"" did not do them any favours, people had high expectations because of that and they certainly fell short. I do not believe the series to be terrible, but I am certainly not praising it's name. I will not scream for tatos..",4
black-clover,"I feel torn. I want to watch more but I can not with Asta, the MC, screaming most of the time. The first episode seemed interesting, even if generic, but that is perhaps due to the high quality of the animation. What I might try is turning down the volume. Or, I just may check out the manga instead.It is my hope that if this should ever see an English dub release that the English VA for the MC does not do the same thing.",3
black-clover,"This is going to take three episodes before I can tell whether or not this show will actually be as interesting as it was advertised. As a heads up, this is a review coming from someone who knows very little about this series, all I know is that it was hyped up right before it started airing. So this review shouldn't be biased.I already have some gripes about the show.1. The main character's VA is really annoying. He is constantly screaming and it makes my throat hurt just hearing it. It astounds me that he will keep talking like that for possibly 12+ episodes.2. The story so far is somewhat generic and cliche, though the way it's going is not too cliche for my tastes.3. If you look at it from afar it's very hilariously starting to mirror Naruto.I think it goes without saying that there are some good points already, but I want to wait and see before I go too in depth. It was very funny at times so I'll give it a watch every week!Now that we have gotten to episode 4, I gotta say that I need to see even MORE episodes before I can even call this worthwhile. It kinda bugs me because it's starting to set itself up for a long running show like One Piece or Naruto. If it does, I think this will just be like Fairy Tail with me, where the only reason I watch it is because I had the time to watch it every week. Hopefully, if it doesn't have long seasons like Fairy Tail, etc. then it will pace itself accordingly.I mean, right at the end of ep 4 it did make me want to see the next episode, but I don't really know if it will be as good as I think it is.",5
black-clover,"The story and art of Black Clover led me to find manga translations to read, so I like the story.  However, since it's inception in anime, it feels like the animation has slowly degraded.  It was great, and then at some point it's like they switched animation companies or something and the quality of the character animations took a hit.  Very noticeable difference, but still tolerable.However this last episode (12/18) seems to have taken a -drastic- turn for the worse.  The battle sequences were so poor, it was hard to tell what was going on.  And at some points my friend and I were watching and we started joking that it seemed like maybe they ran out of money and stopped coloring things.The story, in my opinion is still strong enough to keep me going, but if the animation quality doesn't recover, I'm likely to drop the anime completely and just stick with the manga.",2
black-clover,"Characters: 3/5Story: 4/5Animation: 2/5Flow: 1/5Overall: 2.5/5The start of this series was super fun and interesting but as the show went on it was easy to tell that the writers/animators were having reduced budget. This show drags on so much that it isn't even funny. The first three episodes just cover chapter 1 of the manga and they keep that up all the way through. The animation budget also varies greatly from episode to episode, one episode can have epic action and animation but then the next one will look like a turd in comparison. Asta the main character is blander than old bread served with water. The only saving grace to this show is the side characters and their interactions.",3
black-clover,Give it a shot. The first few episodes are bad. because Asta yells about wanting to be the next hokage constantly. the first few chapters of the manga didn't have him using non-caps till like chapter 5.  The first part of that manga and htis anime Might be hard to get past.  I don't know why naruto is constantly yelling about being the next wizard king.Get pass that here is what it does good. and the  reasons to watch1. fights are amazing.  magic fights and then sword fights.2. gordon3. yami4. good humor5. while magic exist not anybody has been shows to have the same type,5
black-clover,I usually give around 5 episodes to give a show a chance whether it grabs my attention or not. The story seems interesting and it seems like the characters and plot can become very good but the overall pace of the story is extremely boring. It does not draw any interest and after a few episodes I find myself not really looking forward to the next episode. I also understand that Asta is the outgoing and loud character in typical animes and there are many character similar to him but his voice acting just gives me a headache. Its not very convicting and is plain annoying. Got to episode 11 and could not make myself continue.,5
black-clover,"The show has a pretty interesting concept. It’s far from original, but it’s still somewhat enjoyable. But... each episode doesn’t actually begin until about 5 minutes in. It kills the pacing. From there you often have flashbacks to previous episodes and then the little animations at the end of each episode. You’re probably only watching 10 minutes of new story and even that is dragged. It’s a good show to binge if you got nothing else to watch. I hear the manga is much better though.",2
black-clover,"It's the classic story of an orphan ""starting from the bottom now we're here"" type story. To be 100% honest nothing about this is special other than Asta's cool sword(s), and his hilarious yell. The characters are fun, the story is fun, and overall it's not a bad watch if you don't mind predictability. This series isn't going to win any awards that's for sure, but I really don't care. I've enjoyed watching every single episode and can't wait for the next one. The more you watch the more you want even though it's nothing special. I think we can all relate to Asta's struggle in one way or another throughout our lives and appreciate this for what it is; simple, clean, fun, and that's what matters to me.",5
black-clover,"For reference: I watch subs and have watched through episode 22 as of Mar. 8, 2018. I do plan to continue following the series for the rest of the season. tl,dr; provided at bottom. Rating: 3 Stars.UPDATED: Dec. 30, 2018. See note below tl;dr for explanation. Updated rating: 2 stars.--Decent artwork and music, no complaints there. Okay quantity and quality of humor/comedic relief. Action scenes are plentiful and decently done, albeit repetitive and a bit predictable. Characters have endearing moments, and I am hoping this'll have some serious character development, which is why I'll keep watching.The plotline and worldbuilding remind me of Fairy Tail, and the main character seems, in my opinion, a cross between Naruto and FT's Natsu. (For example, the main character repeats a mantra: ""I'm going to be Wizard King"" instead of ""I'm going to be Hokage."") These aren't necessarily bad things, nor are they necessarily the responsibility of the screenwriters; I haven't read or looked at the original manga, so it might just be evidence of the typical tropes—clichés?—used in the shōnen genre.Similarly, most of the usual issues I have with shōnen anime are here. Script and plotline are predictable; in-episode recap/flashbacks are excessively repetitive, lengthy, and unnecessary. Main character's energy/excitement isn't endearing, but usually obnoxious (particularly, as noted in other comments, his tendency to yell his life's goal at every opportunity). Side characters seem more or less diverse and humorous, but their backstories (if any) rely on repetitious flashbacks and their development is rather flat. Villains aren't believable or relatable; their motives and backstories are often trite. Context and backstories are redundant, excessive, and often timed poorly: i.e., almost immediately after an issue has been raised, not allowing for buildup or viewer intuition. Because of their repetitive nature, flashbacks tend to detract from/interrupt the flow of the main story rather than adding insight. I am unsure whether the aforementioned tactics are annoying simply because I don't fall under the demographics for their predicted audience. The cover artwork and exposition at the beginning of each episode imply an older teen to young adult audience, perhaps 15+, but the show's current structure and lack of real character development/issues makes me believe the demographics of their projected audience actually are young (9-14?) boys. As I am a female university graduate, I don't fall under either umbrella and can concede some mismatch between their strategies and my reception of the show; however, I know plenty of 9-14 boys who'd be annoyed be the presumptions made here, who are capable of following complex plots, who are able to remember something shown only once, and who appreciate fast-moving plots with three-dimensional, rather than stereotypical or static, characters. Note about Time Usage: It takes, on average, five minutes into each episode before we get beyond the exposition, title song, and recaps to actually start moving forward with the actual episode. This means that, combined with the end credits and backend stuff that take abt two and a half min, 30 percent of the episode's allotted time is essentially wasted. This, too, is typical of other shōnen I've watched, but it's still annoying, particularly with the aforementioned complaints of repetitiveness during the other 70 percent and an already-short time frame.--tl,dr: 22 episodes in, I'm still unsure who this show is geared towards and how it differs significantly from other shōnen like Fairy Tail and Naruto (aside from setting). I am often exasperated with the characters' stagnation and lack of development for both characters and plot. It has a decent set of characters with potential for juicy development, and plenty of action/fight scenes, which is why I watch it, but thus far I haven't seen anything that makes it particularly better or worse than other shows within the genre.--UPDATE 12/30/2018. So, I took a break from Black Clover after episode 24 for a variety of reasons, then I watched episode 63 today just to see how much anything had changed. In summary: not much. Despite having skipped over nearly 40 episodes (which is worth more than 3 seasons/cours for a regular anime?), there was little to no maturation in the MC, the side characters were all still rather useless and entirely/hopelessly dependent on the main character to win the Big Boss Battle™, whose villain, again, didn't seem all that fleshed out, and it really didn't seem to matter that I skipped 40 episodes, because a lot of time was dedicated to recapping/flashbacking to all of the relevant details needed to understand what was going on. Personally, I am of the opinion that a good anime should trust the viewer to remember relevant details, to create substantial character development in 3 seasons' worth of material, and maybe even make the viewer feel like they missed something important if they skip over 40 episodes. As Black Clover has fulfilled none of these requirements, I am officially taking it off the queue, removing 1 star from my rating, and not looking back.",2
black-clover,"So I only made it through until the end of the third episode before Asta's constant yelling and screaming at EVER LITTLE THING made me delete this from my Queue and write this review. And I don't write reviews. The story seemed like it was going to be alright, and probably would be if the main character ACTUALLY NEEDED LOWERCASE IN HIS SUBS, holy hell WHY did they even bother putting his subs in lowercase ALL HE DOES IS YELL AND SCREAM. Excuse me while I now go and try to remove my brain with a plastic spoon to be able to forget about the excessive idiocy I TRIED to watch.",3
black-clover,"As many have mentioned Asta's shouting is for lack of a better word, the apocalyptic shouts from hell. He SHOUTS EVERYTHING. he does not talk he shouts. That's how he talks. Yes there's also some pretty annoying flashbacks AND like most shonen, the show dumbs down explanations (do keep in mind, these shows are targeted to young teens) so mayyyyybe that's why......However, the show does get better. Does it entertain me: yesAre the characters actually interesting: yes, very much specially the black bulls. Is Asta the only one that will be shouting a lot: Unfortunately no. Magna and Asta typically will resonate with each other's shouts. Is there a fun underlying plot: YES YES! Does the action improve: Yes it definitely does. The most interesting thing to me is the Magic Cast system this show sets up. Yes we've seen many magic shows and this one lacks some originality, but I do love the magic cast system. Those with little magic are considered trash by those who have a lot of magic. You're born into your class, it's very hard for poor people to make it to the top. Those in the lower end of the social class spectrum are expendable. From my perspective, this is the one thing that makes the show be kind of dark. On the surface the plot is just about Asta and his much more achieving childhood friend/brother (sort of). They both aim to become the Pirate King.....oh wait..no that's not right, The Wizard (magic) King...yeah yeah. So they have a fun rivalry and the first, Id' say 6 episodes, spend a long long time setting this up. The episodes past the Knight examination, are actually very fun. This is where the show picks up plot wise, fun wise, and action wise. They introduce a whole lot of fun and diverse characters. The humor gets better. The action gets better. AND they FINALLY explain that Asta's persistent shouting, is actually PLOT related. No it doesn't give him superpowers (at least I don't think it does), but the other characters that are introduced will constantly complain about his loud demeanor and consistent shouting. So there you have it, he's been intended to be that loud. I've never read the Manga, but those who have seem to tell me it's really good. So it seems they made him loud, because plot wise, he is supposed to be loud. It's supposed to be one of those characteristic you hate about someone, however, later you will find yourself confused as to how you could possible come to like such an obnoxious character. Because I do. Once we hit Ep. 9 I realized I liked Asta. Loud and all. Sometimes it's still annoying, but I've come to like and respect his overall design. Maybe those in the orphanage were just used to him (or deaf) by the beginning of the show....which is why they made it seem normal in the first few episodes....On a different topic the underlying plot is pretty interesting to me. Who are Asta and Yuno really? Why were they abandon?What's the deal with the anti birds?Etc. etc.I think any show that has me wondering about the unknown is actually pretty good. I want to keep watching to see if they'll answer those. While hoping it will actually be an interesting answer. It's not a solid 5 star.  So far for me it's a 4.5, but I gave it the 5 because of the social injustices presented, and I like those kinds of story. They can get deep and dark. The show is just starting out too, so I think we can give it a chance for a while longer. It could very well be a classic someday after it gets over the startup bumps.",4
black-clover,"Aside from the long wind-up of the first 4-5 episodes. I would recommend this show to anyone! It's fresh and the anime hasn't been made too flashy which is rather nostalgic in of itself, showing off the older style of animation. The story takes a few episodes to really kickoff and only after the later episodes does the story start to take hold of you and have meaning. It's an evolving plot that will leave most wanting more and more each episode the finish. Highly Recommend this!",4
black-clover,"If you're the type of person that you dont have the time or patience to be able to give an anime a few episodes to kick off, i TOTALLY get that. Asta's screaming bothering you i can totally get too.  But it definitely does pick up, theres a bit of character development and i mean its nothing amazing but its just solid and knows its audience kinda thing. If you liked fairytail, this you'd probably dig.",2
black-clover,"This show is bad. Not for the strawman reasons you think people hate it for either; eg character voice, rip off. No. This show is bad because of the 3 to 4 minute plus intros, the heavy reuse of scenes(much more noticeable in this dungeon ark...impossible to not notice actually), and the unneeded exposition that's thrown at us every episode.  Oh, I forgot what Asta doesn't have can you please remind me show? Ridiculous.  The story is enjoyable but the nonsense they pull in showing it to us is not. Never in my several thousands of hours of anime watching have I seen something so blatantly unapologetic about showing as little content as they do with this show each episode. (Mostly starting in this dungeon ark). I pray this doesn't become a trend.",1
black-clover,"The first and worst part of this show is the main character's voice. I can understand wanting to give him a bit of an annoying voice, but Jesus. His voice basically makes the show unwatchable anyways. It took me multiple tries to get through the first episode because i have never heard such a terrible voice in my life. Beyond that, the writing is, in my own opinion, kinda terrible. That's just a personal thing though; I realize some people might think the story is fine. But for people who do like the story there is just so much filler (compared to the manga). I have never seen a show with so much filler relative to its source material.",1
black-clover,Watched up to episode 12 have noted some clique characters and situations and the story isn't anything new but I do like the premise. Asta's voice actors having to yell most of his lines is a bit annoying but you either put up with it or you don't. I do like the many powers and most of the characters are likeable the music is pretty good and it is paced pretty well and so far their hasn't been too much fan service which doesn't bother me but may bug others. I'm giving a low 4 on here and a 7 on a 1 to 10 scale I'll keep up with it and would give it a mild recommendation. Adding more as the series has gotten better they've pretty much stopped most of the yelling and began to concentrate on the story and development of the various teams they were picked to join so I'm going to up my rating to a high 4 and a 8.0 on a 10 scale. Getting pass the first season is a trial but gets better after that.,4
black-clover,"I got to see this one just cus' I got bored, and I already knew about this anime, but never caught my attention, then I was on steam and I wanted to try the Streaming service on it, (which was bad btw) and I watched the first episode, I said that the first episode was pretty bad, but I gave it a chance because it was the first episode, its strange to see an anime that is already all in the first episode, so a couple of days later I saw the second one, it was slow, but SLOW but it gave me the idea that everything is just so people understand the backstory, and I don't complain, then I watched the third one, things got a little better (a little) and after that, 4 and beyond things are more ok, the cons of the anime are the OBNOXIOUS screams of Asta, and that I could predict alot of things, but out of that it was good, even for me, that Shounen is one of the genres that aren't my hit, but it was ok ; )EDIT: also, I don't see the similarity with naruto, and it makes me cringe sometimes...",3
black-clover,"Black Clover doesn't really do anything new or particularly well. The voice acting is annoying until you develop Stockholm Syndrome and begin to simply accept it. It's set in a very generic fantasy world where the fact that everyone uses magic for everything is simply mentioned but not pursued to make it interesting. Asta is bad at everything else but having the power of Anti-Magic and superhuman battle senses; hoo-boy, that's the exact counter to magic users, go figure. Very predictable and full of tired tropes. It's not the worst thing by any means but it's so full of mediocrity that I just can't recommend it to anyone. (Also read the manga and it's slightly better but still 2/5)",2
black-clover,"If you're watching this hoping for something new and original, that you've never experienced before, don't. This show is as bland as bland can be. Asta (main protagonist) who can't use magic, want's to become the very best, in fact, he wants to become Hokage! oops I meant Wizard King, easy mistake. Obviously it's more than just this one example, but I do think it demonstrates my point to some degree. One little thing I've noticed while watching this show, was Asta's constant yelling. It is so soooooo annoying, every word he says has this intense vibrato, and he usually follows that up, with a long scream. It's not funny, it's not endearing, it's annoying. What's worse is the show recognizes how annoying it is, and the characters will even joke about it! It's not funny! Just please stop! Please! Asta is the main character, he speaks at least 90% of the time! It's time to STOP. Another thing that bugs me is the repeated jokes and gags. It's not that bad,  but it is repetitive, especially when the jokes weren't funny to begin with. This actually leads into another criticism perfectly.Filler, filler is to be expected with a show like this. However, Black Clover takes filler to a whole other level, and there is no good reason. Scenes that barley took up 2 panels in the manga,  can last up to 1 minute in this anime. This leads to the show feeling like it's moving at a snails pace, as well as we get more of Asta's constant yelling, and the repeated jokes. Another problem, the animation is kinda crappy, you'll mostly be looking at stills of characters. This isn't really anything out of the ordinary for a weekly show like this though. Luckily, if you turn of your brain, you might just make it to episode 8. I couldn't watch further than that. I still have nightmares of Asta's yelling. I can't recommend this show to anybody.",5
black-clover,"I have many issues with the show. First, and the most obvious, is the migraine inducing scream of the protagonist. While on episode 9 this still bugs me, it has become a 'bearable'(???) noise I learned to live with. The biggest problem in this show is the garbage pacing. Recently I heard the manga was not awful. I am shounen trash, so I read it. The pacing is incredibly fast, which I thought was amazing. Maybe an arc lasted, at most, 7-10 chapters and it moved to the next arc. This anime takes it sweet time getting to the first arc, which sort of starts in episode 8 but really begins in episode 9. The first half of the episodes are typically filler. I'm going to let that settle in. FILLER. In a 12 episode anime. This reminds me of a shounen airing in 2007. It is like they are gearing up to catch up to the manga super quickly. There are 130 plus chapters out. For a seasonal anime that will come out once a year, they will not catch the manga anytime soon. At this pace they will catch the manga when One Piece ends. Take My Hero Academia, this keeps pace with the manga and is still nowhere near catching it. I know My Hero does have like 30 more chapters than Black Clover but that does not matter.My recommendation is to just read the manga because this is painfully slow. I sit and skip through the filler which is about 11:00 minutes of the episode. Is this the new 'King of Shounen'? No. Is the manga a fun and decent read? Yes. Just read it because it really should not be this bad.",5
black-clover,"I never review these things but this was just such a waste. The premise was pretty good and I was really exited to start it but it was just one big disappointment. The show is unoriginal and basically just a big mash of every major shounen, Asta is just a more annoying version of Naruto, the characters are also extremely similar to the twins from blue exorcist, and the setting for them knight exam is basically the town of beginnings. Don't even get me started on Asta's yelling I think im deaf now. I can't even take him seriously he is basically comedic relief and that really is a hindrance from identifying with him and his backstory. The good action and animation is not enough to save this.",2
black-clover,"Asta, the main character, constantly screams and excessively stresses his A's. It's extremely distracting and detracting from this anime. I've found myself muting the volume more frequently with each passing episode, especially when he chains the elongated A's together in several words in sentence.If he wasn't the main character, I could tolerate it but he has tonnes of dialogue and, therefore, compounds the issue.I'm not sure why the producer thought this was a good idea to carry forward but it REALLY detracts from what seems to be a good anime.",5
black-clover,"These writers apparently have no idea how to do something subtle and have no idea how pacing works. They have Asta scream everything which is annoying and repeat themselves and their themes over a dozen times in the first few episodes. The amount of times they reference/have him scream his dream and that not giving up is his magic is so annoying do it once if you suck at writing or show us instead of just having the character scream it every 5 seconds. Also their pacing is awful, the manga moves fast which is nice but this anime moves two times slower than the manga which is unusual to say the least. This could have been fine if they were building their characters depth or laying the groundwork for some big reveal or not being so explicit with their themes but still wanted to get them across. But instead most of the length comes from they slowing everything from the manga down fro no reason and repeating themselves over and over again and I'm not just talking about repeating dialogue, which they do, they literally re show scenes over and over again just to take up a quarter of the new episodes run time and then waste the rest on useless info not in the manga or some gimmick. I like the show and if it had just kept a nice pace and not screamed every single thought the writers had at me I would be happy to watch it.But its like these  writers are in kindergarten and don't understand subtext or realize that we can remember what happened in the last episode and remember the demon scene they show every other episode for no other reason than to waste time. They already only have 24 min to move the plot alone but they waste half that on repetition making it feel so slow and boring.",4
black-clover,"I'm not sure if it gets better, but it just seams too loud. This is comming from an avid one piece fan, but the main character just seems stupid only to be stupid, and the character designs aren't too unique. I mean, Luffy is dumb, but he is also smart (in his own way). This main guy just looks to be dumb overall, so I don't feel connected to him, I feel no sympathy for him (because he's kinda a dick) and I don't feel invested at all.",4
black-clover,"Expect the shonen troupes: underdog-tsundere-harem MC with powerful unknown dark powers, in a wizard fantasy setting.This anime is incredibly slow paced with plenty of in-episode-fillers that needlessly drag the shows progress in (almost, if not) every aspect. Slower than it's contemporary competitors, and slower still even compared to older shows. The show's slow pace is even more emphasized when compared/contrasted to it's manga, which is incredibly fast paced.POSSIBLY redeemable only with high quality animation for main plot-point battles to compensate for the drag. If you enjoy the find that you enjoy the show for it's content, I suggest you read the manga instead. But if you prefer anime over manga as a media, well, I hope you enjoy the show.I'd give the manga 9/10, and the anime 3-4 /10",1
black-clover,"see I love the manga, Its totally worth reading. I actually watched the first episode before starting to read the manga...and one thing I could tell you is that the voice actor for the main character yells...So. Much. My ears were aching! and I felt a bit frustrated! I didnt even watch past 7 mins before I gave up and went to read the manga. and it was ok but I gotta say, just because the guy's dialogue is in  BIG AND BOLD LETTERING  doesn't mean to  Scream On Top Of Your Lungs!!!!  That is all the issue I have for now. I am updated on the manga and kinda get the gist of the story so I'm going back to the anime and see if I can look past the horrible voice acting.",5
black-clover,"Characters are utterly one dimensional, every turn of the story is entirely predictable, dialogue is just... bad.This is all pretty unfortunate because the concept itself sounds good as an elevator pitch: ""Kid with no magic wants to be king in a world where everyone has magic. Try as he might, he doesn't have a chance until a demonic grimoire changes everything.""It's really too bad that what came out of that idea is more like: ""Really dumb kid with no indoor voice or magic wants to be king in a world where everyone has magic. With the power of friendship and an extremely overpowered mcguffin he gets in the first episode it won't be too hard.""",5
black-clover,"THAT IS THE WAY THIS CHARACTER SPEAKS. JUST ONE GIANT SCREAM THROUGH THE WHOLE THING. NEVER HAVE I EVER BEEN SO CERTAIN AFTER 1 EPISODE THAT AN ANIMOO WAS BAD. THE MAIN CHARACTER DOES NOTHING BUT SCREAM IN THE SAME MANNER OVER AND OVER LIKE SOME 13TH CENTURY MONK CHANTING. THE CADENCE IS THE SAME. SCREAM A LINE, AND DRAG OUT THE LAST SYLLABLE WHILE ENDING IN AN UPWARD INFLECTION. THE STORY FLIES BY ANY INTERESTING CHARACTER BUILDING IN YOUTH AND RUSHING US INTO THE AMAZING REVEAL THAT THE UNUSUAL MAIN CHARACTER WHO HAS NO MAGIC, SUDDENLY HAS THE MOST POWERFUL MAGIC BOOK EVER. WOOOOOAH. SADLY THIS REVELATION IS STUNTED BY THE FACT THAT HE PROBABLY DIDN'T NEED TO, AND THE FACT THAT THEY DIDN'T INVEST THE TIME IN MAKING ME UNDERSTAND HOW THIS REALITY IMPACTED HIS LIFE UP UNTIL NOW.GARBAGE CHARACTERS OVERALL, RUSHED STORY, MAIN CHARACTER HAS THE WORST VOICE EVER AND I'M SURE HIS VOICE ACTOR HATES HIMSELF FOR BEING FORCED TO DELIVER LINES THAT WAY, AND IF NOT, HE SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF HIMSELF. SADLY THE ANIMATION AND ART IS REALLY WELL DONE, WHICH SUCKS BECAUSE THIS SHOW IS JUST AWFUL AND WASTING THE TALENT OF GOOD PEOPLE.THIS IS BAD BY CLICHE SHOUNEN STANDARDS.

black-clover,"Insted of episodes at a good pace with the ocassional filler episode, this series feels like it has entire sections in EVERY episode be fillers. Can't remember the last time I watched a series move along this slow with so much inconsequential content.Character development is needed, but the way this series does it seems almost annoying with substantial parts of episodes dedicated to backstories instead of just doing enough to give us backround and move the story along.Doing this review as of episode 5 and will give it a few more episodes, but I am beginning to think this one may not be worth watching.Update: I gave it until episode 8 to see if anything would improve. Nothing improved and if anything I think it got worse.  I think they spent all their money on animators and must have ran out of money for the writer(s) because it is just plain awful how the story moves along so slowly.This is far as I go with this anime and changing from 2 star to 1 star.",1
black-clover,"I enjoy the anime however the pacing is way too slow. I understand there are gonna be 50 episodes and all, but if you are gonna have 6 minutes of theme songs and recaps, and then have the episode cut off at 20 minutes, then there really doesn't need to be 50 episodes. Every Tuesday I watch in hopes that I will see some real action, and every Tuesday I am disappointed with the outcome of the show. The fight scenes are way too short. I am tired of ""learning"" about the characters, I learn about them when I see them fight. I want to see some really evil villains and I want to see Asta and Yuno evolve. I also want to see romance, and deep tragedy, and the recovering that comes after the tragedy. I want to see emotions other than happy all the time. I just wish there was more. It feels like this anime is missing a lot of stuff.",1
black-clover,"Edit: As the series progresses I found myself laughing my ass off... Therefore I had no choice but to raise my rating from a 4/5 to a 5/5!(Also i feel as though Asta will mellow out a little bit down the road because of the way he acted ""afew times"" since joining his guild.)The anime seems to have a great concept and I cant wait to see what comes nxt!The only issue I seem to have with it so far is: Every time ""Asta"" opens his mouth he puts most banshees to shame with that screech of his...(I hope to hear his voice mature a little in the near future)",2
black-clover,"Take this budget Naruto out to the trash where it belongs. The main character is shrill and unlikable, the plot and world-building gets thrown at your face at light speed, and half the plot is spoonfed to you by side characters. Everything about this anime seems to be a carbon copy of Naruto, from the moody and rude antagonist to the spiky haired, dimwitted and loud main character with the simple goal of becoming the best despite the fact that he's talentless. I really wanted to like this anime because of the promising trailer, but the way it's looking now there's hardly a chance I'll give even the second episode a view.",2
black-clover,"My Ears hurt bad enough from listening to the episode 1 MC that I hopped off this episode multiple times wondering how it got such good reviews. Then, I saw the phenomenal plot development of the show and saw that it had great potential. However, unless that MC voice changes (actor changed) or gets his shrill/screeching ""voice"" usage minimized, I will be forced to either watch the animation on mute or read & rate the manga and leave an even worse review here. I have seen anime fix small errors like this and develop into something great... but I'm not convinced it will happen until it does.",4
black-clover,"Excelente anime, en un comienzo la voz del protagonista es bastante molesta, pero la historia se desarrolla desde lo cómico a lo interesante de manera sutil e inesperada. Muy recomendable. Recoge aspectos muy interesantes de otros animes similares, pero logra introducirnos a un mundo de magia y poder de elementos y uso de Powerups como el que se ve en la primera sinopsis (2do episodio) donde el uso de la espada de diablo muestra que el poder físico se ve aumentado en segundos. Espero seguir disfrutando, se ve con buen potencial para ser un excelente anime.",2
black-clover,"Black Clover is a tittle most fans are familiar with - even before it's aired - for better or for worse. Unfortunately, it's coming at a time where most fans are so one sided that they cant see past the mainstream mentality in the West. Which is funny because Black Clover is one of the most popular SJ tittles at the moment, frequently outselling the likes of Haikyuu, MHA, and finishing just below One Piece in the rankings.""If this is what people think, I'll think the same"" applies for Black Clover by the current generation of fans. ""It is generic"". ""It's a Naruto ripoff"". ""It takes all the cliches and brings them together"". Well, I have news for you. 90% of every other Shounen does that as well - yet people cant see past that with Black Clover because they want to hate on it for the sole reason of hating on it and not appreciating the many positives it has. It's funny how people to selectively choose to judge shows.My Hero Academia was met with great applause over the last year by both fans and critics alike, deservingly so (I enjoy it thoroughly), yet it also had the usual cliches most Shounen has, especially Naruto. ""Main character in Deku with no superpowers who got them overnight and thus begin his journey"" or the ""emo side character who's gifted beyond his generation that has a plagued past that'll follow him to his future in Todoroki"" - I know this isn't a review of MHA. The point I'm trying to make is that most fans managed to see past that because MHA has a good mainstream appeal. Hating on it wouldn't feel right. Yet doing so for Black Clover is normal because it has that reputation by the fans. Which is odd.On to the review. I'm a firm believer of not reviewing something from the very beginning, but I felt like I should to reassure fans of Shounen anime and fans who look forward to Black Clover as a manga reader. Long running old school Shounens need time to set the foundations for their success. I enjoy the manga thoroughly. It's one of my personal favorites as well. This series has a ton of potential and episode 1 is a good place to start. It established the grounds really nicely by introducing the two main characters and focusing on them. It covered the OVA really nicely - and I applaud that -  because most fans haven't seen the OVA. Good OST as well. This has a lot of promise and it reminds me of what the anime industry seems to not have anymore, an old school Shounen adventure.All I ask is to judge it fairly. Don't pay attention to fans who'll hate on It just for the sole reason to hate on it. See it for yourself but also remember you're not going to get an impression for the get go. It'll need time. This isn't Naruto. This isn't Fairy Tail (for the life of me I dont get the comparison - because magic, right xD). This is Black Clover. Appreciate it for what it is. If people enjoy it, let them enjoy it. Don't be a troll for the sake of wanting to be a troll. Think for yourselves and be reasonable.",4
black-clover,"Personally, I liked the first few episodes but I understand how some may view it as a bit slow and how it takes some time getting used to the main character. He's a good main character in my opinion and really grows on you. The storyline gets better each episode and I'd say it's very worth it to just watch the show. Many bad reviews (not all) are based on only the first few episodes so I suggest to watch a big chunk of it to really grasp the feel of the show and it's potential. Overall, good show and I really like the 3rd and 4th opening of the show lol.",4
black-clover,"I’m watching this for 62 weeks now and and still can’t wait for the next episode.It’s fun to watch.The main character follows an impossible looking dream.An outsider finds friends, inspires other people (even enemies) and raises to the top, that strongly reminds me of Naruto.But with traits like Rock Lee, since Asta has no magic and massively depends on physical training.Asta has way better team work capabilities than both Naruto and Rock Lee.The story had some interesting twists.There are some themes which are repeated often: relation between Yuno and Asta, them planning on becoming wizard king, Asta not having magic and basically every single member of the Black Bulls is a running gag, each of them has a trait or phrase that is repetitively highlighted.When they went through all of them consecutively and that two episodes in a row, it can become bit annoying. I don’t think this happened often, but this could be annoying when binge watching.Episode SP is not worth it.",2
black-clover,"I've been watching anime for most of my life, and I know they use many tropes from the shonen that came prior, Naruto seeming to be one of its most inspired; HOWEVER, while it is cringe to watch in the beginning, it gets a lot better. An avid anime watcher can tell that they take a lot of things from other shows and meld things together. While it is highly annoying in the beginning, things start to slowly pick up. About after the mid-point, 30ish episodes, you start to get used to Asta and friends and begin to root for them. It might be a bit before or after that marker I mentioned, but the key point is that it gets better eventually. Give it a try!",1
black-clover,"i'll be honest i watched every episode when it came out hoping for something to actually happen then i dropped it at episode 8 due to nothing ever happening, i come back a while later and it was at like 20 something episodes i watch the next episode and a lot starts happening, the plot started to develop and the anime started moving, and at a rapid pace at that. one of the main reasons i dropped it at the time was cause it didn't feel like it's own show just a copy and paste of usual shonen anime and its reviews were really low, like 2 stars if that if i remember correctly.TLDR: slow start so i dropped then a while later i picked it back up and im hooked, i regret letting the initial reviews and it's slow start turn me away",1
dr-stone,"For the first episode, I was happy to see the manga come to life. The animations are quite pleasant and it builds an expectation for viewers. While it can feel underwhelming for some, it is important to note human innovation and technology development throughout most of history was relatively slow. It's only recently we've made rapid advances. As a result, Dr. STONE starts all over in the stone age, so expect a slow brew. But the show hits conflict points and major drivers in the story including significant character development, it will be worth the wait.So far a great start and LOVE the beautiful soundtrack from Tatsuya Kato  (composer for Food Wars, Free!, Revue Starlight).",4.5
dr-stone,"I've been trying to find a decent series to watch after having finished gate and I've been trodding through multiple series but nothing has been able to land a hook.Finally, after a few days of nothing to watch, I came across Dr. Stone. I guess i'm genuinely interested in the series since science is one of my passions (even though a lot of things are incorrect in the series) and the show displays the limitless potential of humans (something I believe in to the extreme). Through science, anything can be achieved.The series is quite interesting as you're left wondering what Senku will work on next or how things are progressing. I highly recommend those that are on the fence to watch a couple episodes to see if the hook lands and catches your attention.9/10",5
dr-stone,Based off the first episode I can already tell how amazing this anime is going to be. There is so much that goes into this show and I cant wait to see how much more they add. Besides the awesome concept the one thing I personally LOVE about this show that not many shows I have watched take advantage of is the power of time-skips. The amount of content and story progression they can fit into a single episode with out it feeling rushed or drawn out over the course of 12 episodes (DBZ) is amazing. From the first episode you already get such well done story progression and satisfaction and yet it leaves me craving more of it. This show has AMAZING potential.,5
dr-stone,"Senku! Senku! Senku! Senku!Abstract attempts at not spoiling below:Everything about this anime is unique and exhilarating. It's not an ""alternate world"" anime like so many have been over the last few seasons, but it gives you that feel of exploring a new reality. And the oh so healthy approach of learning from patient observation and repeated experimentation is such a relief from the standard Shounen trope of BASH HEAD AGAINST WALL UNTIL I WIN THE FIGHT.We need more science in anime, that's all I'm saiyan.",5
dr-stone,"After 'being reincarnated as a slime' we saw numerous garbage level isekais. Dr. Stone is a completely fresh, new and all around great outlook on the things we already know. OP characters from, you could say, 'another world'. General mix of fresh characters and lore around the show isn't sold short by the animations and interactions. More importantly, the goal of the series remains intact as the story proceeds. A big thank you.",5
dr-stone,"When I first started this show right when it came out, it seemed like an interesting enough concept to warrant watching a few episodes. It does seem slow at first, but it is very deliberate and it tells such a deep story not only about the phenomenon, but it also tells a story about one who overcomes the seemingly impossible through the application of science. It retells the story of how we came to be now technologically -- how through persistence, perseverance, and patience -- science and its building blocks can step by step lead us to a better world. The story of course is post apocalyptic but it is a hopeful, more light hearted sci-fi anime. As you progress through the story it does get better and better and grows in humor while learning about cool science things. I honestly don't care much for sci-fi animes as they are usually just, weird. But this one is an exception.I appreciate how intentional the anime is. It has very good pacing in the story and in taking its time in moments to captivate the audience and help them to appreciate the variety of characters and what they bring to the story.Definitely recommend.",5
dr-stone,"The Mystery of the Petrification and the mystery of its undoing is extremely interesting, and captivated me long enough to get intrigued in the story. The main character is extremely smart and quick-witted, although being an ass at times, and his friends provide an interesting foil to his character. The main villains goals are kind of blurry in his logic, but he is intimidating enough to keep the main characters on edge, owing a lot to the performance of the voice actor who also voiced Bruno Buccelati in Jojo's Bizarre Adventure. Over all its a really good show i would recommend to my friends, and i recommend you check it out too.",5
dr-stone,"Make no mistake, Dr. Stone is a shounen series. But that’s ok! The shounen formula is good, and the use of it here is novel and fresh; with each new “power up” being a leap forward in technology. The usual tropes are present, but they are easy to overlook due to how relaxed the show takes itself. The cast are likeable, their goals are clear, and seeing what the future has in store for them is an exciting prospect.",5
dr-stone,"At first, I was like... ""Everyone's stone? wtf..."" I seriously thought it was gonna suck. Turns out this has amazing character's, great twists, and can actually teach a couple things about science. I just wish it wouldn't leave you on such a cliff hanger!My only complaint is how stupid they made the main bad guy. The whole ""kill all old people because they must be evil"" mentality, is absolutely ridiculous. Like, does the dude not know that people grow up? Is he an evil version of Peter Pan!? Ugh, but other than the villain being a book-smart moron, the show is still amazingly good.",5
dr-stone,"This show is in my top 10 anime of all time just on the merit of they use  REAL SCIENTIFIC FACTS!!! Being someone who loves an appreciates science I was instantly sucked in. The show starts off in estimated 2019 and a weird beam of green light sends the world into a literal ""stone age"" only affecting humans and sparrow birds. Senku the genius is the 1st human in the stone age to wake up and figure out what is going on with world, how to survive, and how to create things that were common in the world he knew. From there you are sucked into an adventure of science and discovery.I absolutely regret not watching this show sooner. Now, I am hooked and currently waiting for season 2!!!!!",5
dr-stone,"Humanity has spent thousands upon thousands of years advancing little by little from just playing with rocks to doing something as crazy as landing on the moon. What would happen if all of that was stripped away from us? What if, every human was turned to stone and forced to wait thousands of years to awake again? Would we be able to rebuild the society of our past? Would we want to? Dr. Stone explores these questions through an extremely knowledgeable and scientific boy named Senku, who wishes to take humanity back to the space age. He'll face hurdles though: conflicting ideologies, ignorance, and time will all be playing against him. Does he have what it takes, or will his mistakes end up hurting him and the ones he care about? Find out next time on DRRRRR.sSTOOOONEEEEE",5
dr-stone,This show rocks. It's really one for the ages. It wasn't hard coming up with these puns. All jokes aside this is a really good show! Who would have thunk Bill Nye the science guy would get his own anime as a kid! Ok I am done with the bad jokes and will review honestly.This show has an amazing art style that flows very smoothly. So many good shows have come out this year and this is one of my favorites! If you like apocalyptic type stories and science this is a show for you!,4.5
dr-stone,"I have never seen an anime that made me interested in scientific discoveries like this before. This show goes heavily into real science incorporated brilliantly into a survival type story. I love the manga, and even though I know what will happen in the story I still enjoy watching the episodes as they come out to hear the voices and see the colors. Absolutely one of the best anime airing right now.",4.5
dr-stone,"I see many people comparing the show to the manga, of course they can do so! However, many people do not know what the manga is like, so lemme lay it down. Have you ever wanted a show, where you wanted to continue watching it, and stop halfway only to realise your brain is wanting more? No? Well um, this is awkward cause this is that show! it makes you wanna see more! the dialogue is almost geniune, its animations are pleasant to the eyes, and its story is very, very good. I recomend anybody with some free time to binge watch this starting now, you will not regret it!",5
dr-stone,"TL;DR:  Some tiny problems, sure... but enjoy it for what it is: entertainment.  Also, wow!  That art!  <3This is outstanding art, first off.  I love every bit from character design strangeness on the MC (that hair, though!) to the great landscapes.  I don't know how hard it is to draw all of the details in those drama shots of muscles and power poses but I know for sure they were worth the artists' time because wow.When it comes to story/plot... Anyone can tell you there are a few hang-ups in the depictions of things or loopholes in 'but really, that wouldn't work' logic but let's get real.  Do you watch anime for educational purposes?  PfffffThis whole story is one huge feel-good.  There's overpowered combat that makes hardly any logical sense (kill a lion with one punch teenager?) and crazy circumstances that have no explanation (yet?) but if you accept that it's not over and keep watching to see where the story goes and what happens next instead of getting caught up in the minor details, it's just a fantastic watch.",5
dr-stone,This anime actually teaches you things while still having the same epic vibe as a top notch shounen anime. Ever since it came out it has been my favorite of the season and one of my personal all time preferred. This show is the only one that has me looking forward to every friday. I've felt the urge to simply read the manga and find out myself of everything that is going to happen but I can't help it but not do it because Dr. Stone has to be enjoyed on the best way possible which would be anime in my case,5
dr-stone,"I expected to like this show, but I didn't expect to absolutely love it!It's my favorite of its season! I enjoy Fire Force, but I feel like I love Dr. Stone just a little more!I really hope this show can start a civilization-building surge, like how isekai anime did.It's so fun learning the different lessons that Senku teaches, and relearning some ""basic"" science as well as more advanced science!The show is on episode 11 right now; I can't wait for more!",4
dr-stone,"When I watched the first few episodes I'll admit I found both of the major characters a little annoying, but then after I got to really see their true characters, I actually really like them, much more than a typical anime's MC type, the ones who use the constant ""talk no Jutsu"" and ""I'll make stupid choices but it will work out because goals and ill be the wizard king!!!!"". This one though, he's completely logical and I'm not saying that just to go with what the characters keep saying, obviously sometimes there are a few leaps of logic, but its an anime... But as I said, he's not solely going after some grand goal while abandoning all kinds of logic, he's the first protagonist who doesn't feel like a dumbass past being some ""sTrAtIgIcAl GeNiOuS"", and the reasons for why he's so smart goes beyond just natural talentThe thing I find most appealing about it though, is, at least what I see as its main theme, the idea that you CAN do grand things, and you DON'T need to be stupid about it, I cannot stand when I see a character get away with being stupid for plot reasons and they still get labeled as an inspirational icon, I've never been as inspired watching naruto than when he first made light, or I've never genuinely felt happy when Goku reached a new form, but I was literally jittery when they finally finished the antibiotic, then i hit a pit when i thought it was all for nothing, then it was another high when it was actually shown to work, I'm not saying this show is better than all of the OGs for that reason, and there are OBVIOUS examples of older anime doing this as well, but this is just a bit of fresh air compared to the vast majorityAll this being said, it does have some flaws, like the ""fake-out death"" thing was kind of eh, and some jokes with the weird faces go on a tad bit too long, and I can see this being one of those anime that are good, but people will overhype it and that may ruin the experience for some, which i just have to hope doesn't happen.Either way, it was absolutely worth my time watching, and I'm very glad I did watch it, i also really do think the messages it has constantly throughout the show are amazing for younger kids to watch if they happen to come across this anime, even going as far as touching on that taboo of someone being a bad guy, but not a necessarily bad person, and the whole show is basically expressing that even tiny progress is progress, as early as episode 2.I just want to stress one more time that i think they wrote the MC near perfect, he's genuinely inspiring in his high moments withOUT the grand speeches, just putting in his work and improving the lives of everyone around him, and even actively telling people not to thank him, it's weird how much a digital and functional character can make ME, watching on a computer screen, feel relieved when light is finally achieved. He's not even held back by the complaint of ""he didn't fully earn his success, he had some op broken mechanic that got him there, the most powerful quirk, a tailed beast, or is all of the op races, We're shown why he's smart, we're shown how he gradually got smarter, and we're shown what his father did to help him along the way, the father that HE inspired which got him those benefits in the first place, so his knowledge is absolutely not unearned, and every advancement is gotten slowly and progress is always stressed to be grueling, every single thing he got, he did himself with the tools everyone has and at times even less.Now that im done with by book/rant, im just going to leave it off by saying its not the BEST, but it is FAR from average and is not a waste of time, even flashbacks long enough to make naruto blush aren't painful, they are heartwarming and enjoyable, but it DOES have its flaws, so 9.5/10 for me",5
dr-stone,"but that's the engineer in me. It still was a fun ride from Fred Flintstone to cellphones.While parts of the plot struck me as unbelievable, I was able to get my Helmet of Disbelieve tuned in to a good wave length, and enjoyed what was, otherwise, a well put together narrative. Logic, initiative and perseverance win the day in this title, rather than brute strength, magic or deception.There's a wide variety of characters, both protagonist and antagonist, that have well defined designs. I like most of the artwork for them, although I do wonder if Senku isn't an escapee from a Yugio episode with that hair. I love the little girl with the melon head. Kawaii! The main characters get some decent development, and even some of the secondary character do as well. In fact, the entire village, where the story occurs, gets an interesting backstory. I do think it would have been better to have rounded things out a little better by giving us some more on the main antagonist and what made him tick, though. The background artwork kind of ran the gamut from alright to looks real good. The animation also runs a gamut. In a couple spots it's real good, but in more spots I would have to say it gets dangerously close to kid-vid. It all comes out in the wash as an average effort. Voice acting is average to slightly above. Mostly it is fine, but there are a few scenes where the emotional content in the Japanese struck me as a little over the top. It wasn't enough to become aggravating, though.Direction was OK if not inspired as well. No big chances taken here. There were some instances that I thought were minor annoyances, but over all it wasn't distracting to the story. As a whole I found Dr. Stone a worthwhile project, and could easily recommend it to anyone that might find the premise compelling. I'd rate it an 82/100. A solid 4 stars.",5
dr-stone,"Everyone has a fridge. Or a phone. Or some electronic. And honestly, old devices are taken for granted. But we have no idea how they work. Just that they do. (Some people might look into it on their own, but generally that's more advanced stuff.) Dr. Stone really opens your eyes up to what we take for granted by starting from scratch and making everything new again. It really is an awesome show with good in-depth characters and struggles.",5
dr-stone,"Dr. Stone is an amazing show, and I really like it. I got into the series because my friend told me about it, and it became a binge. I'll go into details below:Plot:The plot of Dr. Stone is definitely the best part of it. It goes into detail about science and technology development, but that doesn't make it boring. The idea is super original which makes the series more enjoyable. It's easy to follow but it's still extremely interesting. I'd rate the plot a 5 out of 5. Characters:I don't really like the characters that much. The main character is kind of annoying. However, that doesn't make the series bad or anything. You can definitely come to enjoy the personalities of the other characters that show up later in the show, and I think their talents and weaknesses make the plot keep moving forward. I rate the characters a 3.5 out of 5.Development:I haven't been in the fandom for very long of Dr. Stone, but I think they're still working on it and making new episodes. I can't give it anything under a 5 star rating as I haven't finished the show yet, but I do think they're making new episodes and there's definitely plenty to watch. I'll rate the development a 5 out of 5.Music:The music isn't anything special but it isn't bad, either. I've never heard a song and thought that it was bothersome and the intros don't bother me, either. I wouldn't give it under a 5, because it doesn't really bother me too much. This is the second anime I've watched, but I think my judgement of the music is pretty accurate. I'd rate the music a 5 out of 5.",5
dr-stone,"I finished it so its not terrible, but its no where near the realm of true 5 star anime like Stein's gate or even better constructed comedies such as Konosuba or Hinamatsuri. Sometimes are done well, like the main character's established as a genius and you've no reason to doubt that throughout the story. He makes smart choices not typical dumb anime ones. The premise of the anime however leaves a lot to be desired and the further into the anime you get the worse it seems and the less sense it makes. Its anime, so you forgive sometimes, but if you're trying to use the real world as your setting and not something fantasy related then you use real world rules. Thats how it works. Not terrible, but overall it goes very slow, there are lots of cringy moments I had to skip and the science plot holes knock this down to a 3/5. Its very popular, for some reason, but you could spend your time better with a hundred other shows.",5
dr-stone,"What I watch for this season is that the people on Earth turn into Stone including the protagonist Senku and his friends. Over 3700 years later Senku is the first person to be unpetrified and he is on the way to revive humanity. But first Senku needs to survive such as shelter, finding for food, making science things, looking for people like Taiju to work for him, then eventually, he finds a tribal village to continue making his kingdom of science, and that's how the story goes on.Other than that this Science Anime is such a masterpiece and I love watching it every single episode of it. It follows the source of Manga frequently and amazingly animated like ever before. So, therefore, without a doubt that this anime is beautiful in terms of the story, background, and even the effects too.This anime is surely definitely watching it see for yourself and I recommend you for that if you are looking for some great science anime like this.",5
dr-stone,"I just finished watching all episodes of Dr Stone and let me tell you - it was a wild, bloody worthwhile ride! I have recently gotten back into watching anime because I experienced a dry spell, of boring, unoriginal, heartless anime, but this anime (along with a handful of other recent works) have reminded me why I love it so much. Dr Stone is original, imaginative (yet realistic), heart-warming and hilarious. I can't think of any way to improve it. I never thought I'd enjoy it so much, I hope season 2 follows in its footsteps. I highly recommend everyone to give this anime a chance, get past at least the first 3 episodes. I haven't cried, laughed and been so captivated so much in a long time, and I know you will too.",4.5
dr-stone,"Speaking as a long time anime fan, it's very very rare these days that a new show comes around and I don't immediately say ""it's another X"". Many of even the best anime share a lot of heavy similarities. But then we get Dr. Stone, with a remarkably original story that really lacks any direct comparisons. Without spoiling much of the plot Dr. Stone is, grossly oversimplified, a post apocalypse story. But that's about where the standard archetype ends. It has elements of a shonen action series without the super powered protagonist or violence focused plot line. It has sci-fi elements without impossible tech like FLT space ships or giant robots. It has creative humor, excellent story telling and is written with a balance of real world science and suspension of disbelief that's largely unmatched. The pacing, world building, character development and music are all on point and fantastic! Every episode leaves me dying to know what comes next! The music always does a great job of matching and emphasizing the tone of the scene. The author does a superb job of balancing a serious story with endlessly enjoyable humor and powerful emotional scenes that left me on the verge of tears more than once!Only downside is the art style. Several characters outright are so different that the seem to come from different artists and the MC has the worst case of protagonist hair since Yugioh... That said, after getting drawn into the story these complaints are quickly forgotten. Another minor critique is that, despite the show's reliance on real science there are a few glaring holes in the idea that some people wont be able to set aside. In the end, this series blew my mind and easily gets my vote for anime of the year 2019 despite some seriously good competition. I can't recommend it more highly, an absolute MUST WATCH! Pros:Truly original story.Great writing, pacing, character development and world building!Fantastic music and audio direction!A nearly perfect balance of serious story, humor and emotional scenes.Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideOh, and SEASON TWO CONFIRMED!Cons:Inconsistent and somewhat silly character design.Some glaring science plot holes.",4.5
dr-stone,"Probably the best anime of the end of the year.Refreshing, inspirational, cute, funny and so enjoyable.I must admit, I didn't know what to expect after the first episode but dear lord, this has been one of the best ride in a very long time.You get to see so many cool things, learn a lot and all of that with fun.The show is not also to centered about the main char which is very good.Bring on season 2 ASAP!",5
dr-stone,"I love the nerdy science side of this anime. It's serious and silly in a good mix, and the journey of making stuff far beyond their ability without Senku is really fun. Love this idea especially because it's focus is on science and the restoration of humankind, with cool action but not just full of fighting and ""training"" to be stronger, which I also love of course, but this is a refreshingly unique anime. Good job Crunchyroll. A+",5
dr-stone,"Facts on this Anime:- first 4 episodes are a tad slow- episodes 4 and on are AMAZING- character development is magnificent- main character is very impressive- like the main theme of this which is SCIENCE and really promoting education the importance of it.- story is well paced, well told and overall GREAT- All emotions exist in this anime: Drama, friendship, comedy and so far small romance here.- Intro\ Outro's to date are a little weak.- Reveals throughout the show are epic and fun to watch.- Worth your time to watch and binge right now.",5
dr-stone,"I watched this show based on my brother's recommendation and was suprised to find how enjoyable it was. Usually, I hold mixed feeling toward most animes/manga, so when I say that this was enjoyable, I mean it. The characterization is great, the plot is enticing, and the atmosohere is perfect. But, most important of all, the series has likeable characters, no matter how scummy. I've seen too many anime that tried and failed miserably to make their characters relatable or even, what I would consider, likable. I have to say, the villain reminds me heavily of Dio from JoJo's Bizzarre adventure - charasmatic, calm, swift, and deadly. Go watch Dr Stone if you haven't already.",5
dr-stone,"I started watching this series back when i was at my dorm. at first i was a bit hesitant to watch this but in the end it ended up being very good. Then i got back home and watched one episode on my laptop, my dad (who is very picky about anime) liked it too so i connected my comp with the tv and since then everyone at home is watching this. This is a must see anime, i've been recommending this to my friends and all of them like it. At times it serious, at times it's funny, it has a good balance between the two. The science parts are awesome too not too difficult and not too easy to understand just good enough for you to enjoy it. The story is awesome, we've got a villain who is great and a MC who is 10 billion percent awesome xD It's rare (for me) to actually have all these points being very good at the same time so for me this gets a 5/5. Definitely watch it, you won't regret it!",5
dr-stone,"This show has really blown my mind by how much I'm enjoying it. The start of it isn't even that slow, and it's still enjoyable, but when it picks up.. IT REALLY picks up. Wonderfully timed and unique humor, progression, adventure, emotion, music, and SCIENCE. So much entertaining science. I've cried more than I expected because of this show - because it's that good, and the timing of the music (and timing of lack of music) is so powerful.Great work. Very impressed.",5
dr-stone,"Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics. A needed part of the education and daily life made into an Anime.  An awesome anime to say the least. If you were to tell I would cheer and worry about a scientist I would call you crazy. Not since the passing of Stephen Hawkings have I care that much for science.  A dreaded theme in my formative years.  It is explained to the moist basic explanation.  Dr. Stone is more profound than you might think at first glance. The you ask yourself: Where will we be without STEM? The Stone Age is the quickest and most simplistic answer.",5
dr-stone,Dr.Stone Fuccccs with it! I hope they find out what made then turn to stone but also my boi Senku (one of the main characters) making big moves. I would recommend this anime to my friends (If i had any) that don't even normally watch it. If you want to watch an anime that you can learn a couple things from this one is a good. It is not that hard to follow and is funny too. Every time they want to do something in becomes into a whole mission which I think it awesome I don't ever get bored of watching it.,4
dr-stone,this anime is very interesting and i really like the concept. but i'm not a big fan of girls with huge b00bs or slutty dresses. i don't know why it became a thing. i just can't take any work with huge b00bs serious. like the new one piece.                                                                                                                                                                                              00                                                                                                                                                       00,5
dr-stone,"I love the premise! In some ways, there is the Isekai feel of someone with knowledge of our 'modern' world that is transported into a world without any of that and has to build their way up again. However, these characters don't just have a time skip and suddenly have a trunk and gasoline. Every single process and item they need they have to get, and it's difficult! It's certainly not easy to make all this from scratch and I love how Dr. Stone shows that. Senku is a brilliant man and it shows. The sheer dedication to count every second for that long, just to know how long it has been? The ability to retain all of the knowledge he gained? Insane, and I love it.",5
dr-stone,"I really, really like the show for what it is. Important part of that sentence ""for what it is""In a lot of ways, it's Jojo on a date with Science or, for my older readers, an anime homage isekai of Pinky and the Brain. Remember this is a SHOW, not an educational documentary or something of that sort. Dr. Stone is somewhat of a reverse Isekai, where instead of going to a new world, it's the same world, gone backwards. Humanity is pretty much dead and the world is returned to it's roots like something from the game The Last of Us. It follows the story (after 3 or so episodes) if a BLATANT gary stu (senku) who somehow knows 2,000,000 years worth of knowledge and I'm convinced he stores it somewhere in his hair trying to return civilization to what it used to be and solve the overlying mystery of why everyone turned to stone in the first place. The show is GOOD, it's very entertaining, if you can just watch it as a show. This is by no means accurate science, it can't be- it has to stay entertaining, and there's constant back and forthing between a legitimate show and what I can only describe is over-dramatic Jojo antics. A teenager literally takes down a lion with his bare hands, naked, and then they give us a series of glory shots before he starts going full plot hole villain on us.  Senku, as much as I'm amused with his character, is literally insanely broken. There's no way even a genius would remember that much, especially after being frozen in stone for thousands of years- sensory deprivation can literally cause a person to go insane after a few days. Everyone else is literally stupid compared to Senku, even in the modern world (You're pinky and he's the brain). So no, the science isn't 100%, but that doesn't mean it's not fun. The show is just that: Fun. It's dramatic, it's silly, and it's ultimate pretty funny at times. (I'm wiling to sacrifice EVERYTHING for a SODA- Gen is my favorite character for a reason). To be blunt, I'm glad to see there's no horribly crammed in romances- Senku's only love is SCIENCE.  The art style varies for me, I love how the men are drawn but the weird doe eyed way they drew the girls and the BLATANT homages of ecchi culture are just... sigh. The girls deserved a bit better (common in anime), but the rest of the world is beautiful. If you want to watch Dr. Stone as an analytical person expecting to learn something: Don't. You probably won't enjoy it due to the inaccuracies. If you want to watch a somewhat silly, science THEMED show that's entertaining: go ahead and watch it!I am going to keep watching Dr. Stone for the entertainment aspect- it's not supposed to be educational and shouldn't be unfairly judged as such. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars from me is the way the girls are drawn. Seriously- why are their eyes that far apart. It bothers me. Over ecchi-ifying the normal interactions also lost that 1 star for me (Episode 15, I'm looking at you).",4.5
dr-stone,"this is an original and entertaining showThis might honestly be my favorite anime as I'm writing a review while only being 6 episodes in as of me writing this review, however I rarely write reviews unless they're actually good or really bad. It's educational and unlike other fantasy worlds it has its own story and an actual smart protagonist. LIKE  A REAL INTELLECTUAL, not just one scene in which they're smart, but throughout the entire series at least(till the 6th episode since I've only watched that far when I wrote this review) If you like Code Geass or Isekai world animes, you're definitely going to like this one.",4.5
dr-stone,I first started watching when there were only a few episodes out; after seeing a tiny bit of lazy animation I went to go look at the manga to find that it is an artistic masterpiece- the manga is literally so well done that at first it made the anime look like hot doodoo; but with time the animation has held up and proven to be a match for the manga. The characters grow on you and it really does become an amazing show after only a few episodes. Give it a shot and stick with it and it will be ten billion percent worth it.,5
dr-stone,"I normally don't do reviews for anything but I adore this series.I started this show late cause I wasn't sure if I would like. But since starting it I look forward to every Friday release. It is a very refreshing series I think especially because with all the isekai animes that have been coming out, this anime stands out because there is no other world or super fantasy aspect, it is still the real world pretty much just starting over. So I think with the realism and science mixed with just a stone age world gives it a refreshing feel in today's anime scene. Also just the lack of fillers so far, and how every episode gives some progression, seems to make the story feel a bit more rich and interesting.",5
dr-stone,"I was blown away by the first episode. By the second ep I knew I picked an awesome anime to watch and review.The anime/subject is intense but there is a lot of comic relief, mainly by the big oaf ( Taiju Oki) although sometimes Senku ( Dr. Stone) contributes as well. I would love to talk more with someone about this animeFeel free to follow me on Youtube or patreon https://youtu.be/rx4FrkjQ6WM https://www.patreon.com/Kisstokis",5
dr-stone,"This series is unlike anything else! They have you hooked from the first show! These writers know how to peak someones interest. They created an anime that creates the ""Urgency"" to want to keep watching and become impatient for the next episode. The story line and setting has not been done before and it stands out compared to all these re-incarnation animes that have been coming out lately. It's goes on the line that many of us adults think about ""if i could start over again with the knowledge i have now"".By far one of the best animes out right now in its own category! I dare say it ties with My Hero Academia ^_^",5
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"This is just my opinion on Boruto, and what I honestly think. I've heard people say that Boruto is worse than Naruto, both in quality and story-telling, but i'd like to think that's not the case. People are comparing Baruto to Naruto, and of course it's not going to live up to Naruto's massive name. At least not yet. But I like to think of Boruto, not as a continuation of Naruto, but like a different anime entirely. It doesn't take a genius to see that Naruto is no longer the hero, it's Boruto. And people going on about how it's not as good, or Naruto is better, or let it die, that fine to think that way, but remember Naruto seems better because its more flushed out, it's actually a finished story, and because it's nostalgic. After all, this is a new chapter for the Naruto universe, but don't think of it as a sequel, or a forced follow up, think of it as it's own brand, and it's own story. So for i'm excited for the road ahead, and judging from the past of Naruto, this story will be finished by the time i'm in my mid-twenties.",3.5
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"If I was watching this for the first time without ever having watched Naruto, I'd probably have stopped after the 2nd episode.  The protagonist, Boruto, is a young man with a very narrow view of the world.  This father is the leader of his village and a workaholic, he's angry at his dad for not being around more, but does little to nothing to actually support his mom and sister and instead is a trouble maker, acting out in a desperate cry for attention from his father, but if he got that attention, he'd reject it out of hand.  The kind of kid that has everything, but not what they want, and nothing will ever be good enough for.  Difficult for me to even like a character like this.Having actually followed Naruto form episode one though - there's a HUGE issue with this story from the word go.  Naruto ignoring his family.  It just doesn't work on so many levels it's ridiculous, regardless of how much the job of Hokage demanded of him, Naruto is not the type to leave the women he loves and his kids without a husband and father.  He's uniquely suited to be able to do the job of Hokage AND still have time for family al la Shadow Clones.  Even without that - he's just not the type to leave his own family on auto-pilot and hope everything turns out okay.I realize there is a social commentary going on here for a common occurrence in Japan, regarding absentee fathers that are so overloaded with work they are rarely ever home and the effects on the family, it just doesn't inspire the hope and heroism that the Naruto franchise has build it's amazing success on.",4
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"Do you love fillers?Do you love a dragged out meaningless story?Do you love a plot that gets nowhere?Do you love a story that seems to be getting to a turning point but you realize it is not, and it is just another side quest that ends up being a total waste of time and all bs that serves no main purpose to the overall storyline?You love this anime then. Boruto like naruto is an anime filled with fillers and bs storylines that take like 20-30 episodes to reach and ultimatum that could have easily been reached in 3 episodes.So far everything up to the current episode besides the chunin exam and events that followed after have been meaningless. That being said you can skip over all the other 60 some episodes and miss nothing relevant that entails any major events in this series overarching storyline. Thank you Boruto. This anime has been nothing but a bore and I continue to watch it angrily for the mere fact I liked naruto. Although I did not watch naruto as it was produced because I am sure I would have hated it too. I skipped all the filler garbage.If you plan on watching this garbage I recommend looking for a post that tells you what episodes matter and what episodes do not, like with naruto, so you do not waste your time. I believe a good 5-6 episodes is cho chos love interest, fucking waste, and then a good 20-30 episodes is the crew looking for dogs and doing random quests in the city. More of a fucking waste. My advice would be to watch the first 5 or so episodes to see the gist, skip everything, including the one girl with the beast inside her, because ultimately that had nothing to do with anything. Watch the chunin exams and the following events, similar to the movie and then after that nothing relevant is occurring. So like 20 episodes of total relevant storyline.You are welcome!",3
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"The first episode was fine but it quickly went downhill from there.Boruto suffers some major flaws, which might've been less noticeable if the Naruto universe was fresh, but since it's not...Characters are too similar to their parents. Boruto is bo-ring.The plot/conflict has no drive. They open the series with some future BS promising a huge conflict and greatness instead of hooking us with likable characters in a new/interesting setting.Naruto as a Hokage and father is... disappointing.Children aren't clones of their parents. And since we already had 500 episodes of the standard shonen hero, I'm not about to watch a clone.",1
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"after seeing 95 episodes i can finally say that this anime is meaningless. It lacks story, it's childish, boring, it has tons of bad fillers. The only thing that keeps me watching this anime, is because the old iconic characters from Naruto, such as Naruto, Sasuke, Rock Lee, Kakashi, Orochimaru and so on. The fights are extremely short ones, not even a single fight lasted more than 2 or 3 episodes.  It gave me the sensation that this anime is a lowcost one. 90% of the people watching Boruto, are Naturo veterans, i mean, at least +18 years old, but Boruto targeted 11 years old audience. It's really disappointing for me, because i was the one who defended this anime from the beginning, saying that it would get better. But after 95 episodes, it can't. (I won't cease watching Boruto, i have a little hope to hang on)",1
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"let's start positiveThe hook at the start is genuinely interesting.  The animation and art style are much better than i anticipated.  I was worried they'd continue with the dated animation of shippuden (no hate, but it started almost 10 years ago).And now to anger the fanboys (god forbid we look at a show objectively)They spend literally no time characterizing anybody.  We get some brief clips that basically say, hey he's a troublemaker and his friend is more levelheaded.  After that, it's him being a small-town hero.Most shows have so much more to critique.  but, that's the show.  Watch Boruto get into some mischief, and then do something heroic to resolve something absurd.  that's been every episode so far.  There isn't even any real actionI was really interested to see this.  generational arcs for shows can be really cool, and Naruto has some really deep lore to it.  unfortunately this had the depth and writing of a children's cartoon.",2
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"So I know Boruto is completely different compared to Naruto, and Yes I get that is suppose to be a good thing, but When you do the anime wrong and Make the characters bad compared to their parents then it's just a sad excuse for an anime. Boruto is suppose to be this prodigy child where he has the skill and power to become a top tier Ninja, but His emotions get in the way of everything and He acts like he is entitled to most things, and Has daddy issues beyond belief. Not to mention their missions aren't interesting and Seem Elementary compared to the missions Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura went on with Kakashi sensei. I'm sorry, but This is a fail of a classic Shonen. I rate this anime a 2 out of 5 *'s",2
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"The pace of the anime is good but so far it is a copycat of Naruto, the children have the same personality and ninjutsu as their parent so it's not very refreshing...The most annoying thing is that Naruto as a dad/member of the family sucks. I don't really like the fact that for a kid that grew up without parents it actually does the same to his kids and he doesn't really fit Naruto's personality. Quite a shame that Boruto hates his dad!",2
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"I wanted to like this series so much because I missed Naruto.What they made is a show where adult naruto becomes a salaryman and has a kid who is a spoiled brat who hangs out with his friends and causes (a little) trouble. Every episode is the same, nothing happens to the story because they want all the action to happen in the movie theatre episodes.Basically, they are using Naruto and trying to extra commercialise it but without making a product you even care about.What a waste or of great intellectual property. I will stop watching it until I hear they sort out every episode being a filler.",2
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"Now before you tell me the reason I dislike Boruto is because I'm just a hater, I want to explain that I wanted Boruto to be a return to form. Original Naruto was great and I was hoping to relieve that but Boruto is a different series. The reason I dislike Boruto is because it too similar to shippuden Naruto. Eye powers are the only powers that matter and are spammed, the plot is filler and never moves forward, and the battles are somehow worse than shippuden. There all about who can make the bigger explosion yet there not as a flashy and this show dosen't have the gotcha moments of original Naruto. Its bland. I never liked the war arc and this show just feels like a extension of that. I honestly don't care about Boruto being a brat, Naruto's entire character was that. But it's the fact that he insults the character I have followed since I was seven. Overall, I feel like everyone hates on this show for the wrong reason. What we wanted was original naruto but what we got was the war arc with Kaguya ripoffs appearing every now and then.",3
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"IF you have seriously been with Naruto from the beginning. Then either stop or don't watch this series. It feels forced. From the final moments of Naruto, i would have expected this whole series to be an illusion I mean let's face it, Naruto should have stopped after the final arc. It was very very needless to continue to BORUTO. We fans who waited each week for each episode have always felt an odd change in the near ending of NARUTO. BORUTO shouldn't have ever come to existence. It's a humiliation to the NARUTO series. PLUS we all expected/wanted a NARUSAKU canon. I mean i hate Hinata, but forget the canons, this series is far worse than the canons in NARUTO. The development of all the characters were going so well, until the NARUTO:LAST and the ending of NARUTO. It changed too much for ones liking, the transitions was anything but good or smooth. Moreover, Boruto character is the worst i have ever seen.This is a series i will happily erase from my memory. I will always remember the NARUTO we grew up with. I wish for NaruSaku Happiness.",3.5
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"I just finished watching Naruto & Naruto Shippuden so I decided to go watch this to see if they could take the story to new heights...They didn't. The first episode was okay but as you watch you realize how flawed Boruto is a a person. His entire thing is 'I have daddy issues and I really want to spend more time with him but I'm also a piece of garbage who can't realize how great his father actually is.'. Look Boruto, I get it. You want to spend time with your pops, but don't act like… like… like… a brat. You want people to recognize your strength, but you push everyone around you away with your annoying behaviour and hints of narcissism. Also, Naruto would definitely be a better father. He grew up without a family and, yes, he did have a few father figures here and there but for most of his life, he was without. Knowing this, it's obvious that he would have flaws as a father but this? No. He would be able to understand, to some extent at least, the importance of someone acknowledging you. Someone being there for you. But in the show, he just doesn't. Sure you can be proud of someone but if you never tell them, or if you're never around, how are they supposed to know that you care? Last thing. Be creative with your names. FOR GODS SAKE! If you don't want fans to compare the two, one - don't make their names the same, two - maybe expand on OTHER villages. Like, a different series didn't have to be in the hidden leaf. It could've been done in a lesser known village or a completely new place within the Naruto universe. Three - Don't name the show, 'Next Generations'. That's telling people that it WILL be a continuation of the show you love so much.All in all, just don't watch it, nothing will change, you can live without it. Don't even watch it for the original characters because most of them aren't even there most of the time.",3.5
boruto-naruto-next-generations,Please stop spoiling the name of the anime with your foolish storyline and fillers. It lacks coherence in some places. For example when boruto went to save mitsuki he and the old man caught in a place where they cant get out without a heart stone and we were wondering what it would be about. But they got out without the stone and did not even what was the whole heartstone was about.The fillers are nonse. If you dont have a proper interesting story atleast ask the fans. I hope they have a better one. Make it interesting. Day by day we are getting lost of our interests. No proper fights or twists to make it interesting. Please as a fan like to make this anime better. Dont make it worse.,1
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"Naruto is my favorite series of all time. This does not compare, and honestly that's very disappointing because I had high hopes for it. Most of this feels like a child's cartoon and does not feel like the OG Naruto or Naruto Shippuden. I will say, however, this anime has AMAZING potential. If you watch the revised Chunin exam fight between Naruto and Sasuke VS Momoshiki, you will see just how amazing this show COULD be. I will return to this anime once the story picks up and I hope I will enjoy it in the future. But for now, I will wait and watch something else.",1
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"Discounting nostalgia, since I watched both series when I was much older, and enjoying it for what this is, fans of the original  Naruto, I have a caveat. If you like Naruto Uzumaki as a character, a hero you have seen go from hyperactive loudmouth half pint, who only desires to be Hokage to earn approval and affection, to a genuinely caring, selfless, and mature individual worthy of this position, turn back.I will try to avoid spoiling the original series, but my problem is as followed. Naruto Uzumaki is a borderline workaholic, and thus an absent father, in his son's Boruto's life. Given what we know of Naruto's own tragic backstory, this just angers me. They turn this careless, selfless hero into a neglectful father, despite the sad childhood he endured that by all means, would have made Naruto try to be a father.Incoming arguments I see.Naruto is busy keeping the peace? He's only stamping letters day after day, to the detriment of his relation of his own son, even missing the kids birthday. Even then, it has been mentioned that the entire world is experiencing a period of unprecedented peace. Given the whole breaking cycle of hate Naruto strived to do in Shippuden, and what we see afterwards, seems like he accomplished it well enough. Hell, Tenten cannot even sell weapons due to the lack of conflict.He considers the whole village his family. A bit more legitimate, but I don't honestly think that Naruto wouldn't eschew stamping papers to be there for his son. It completely goes against his character for him to not value his family over paperwork.Yes, this is the entire reason why I choose to give this series One Star. I think many things improved, but having a bratty protagonist is one thing, tarnishing the legacy of a rather decent protagonist is another.This is extremely noticeable as it goes against his very character.There's no reason for this. Have Boruto be tired of being referenced only as his father's son, and perpetually be in his shadow. Have Naruto hold high expectations that Boruto may be stifled against, anything.",1
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"Although this anime may be okay on it its own, it is important to recognize it is a continuation of Naruto and it seems very out of place and only seems to be dragging on. Besides the first scene in the first episode (the future), I had some hope that the show would pick up (I know it's still a little early to judge) but all I've seen thus far is an uninteresting plot that maybe would pull little kids heart strings, That being said, I have personally felt more negativity from this show than feelings of pleasure from things being done correctly(from a point of view of a long time fan).",1
boruto-naruto-next-generations,Don't watch it. Just don't. Read the manga instead.The studio has completely ruined the story and turned it into a slice of life with no story progression nor character developement.All i can say is if you don't like the first 2 to 3 episodes then you're not gonna like the rest. Cause it only goes downhill from there with a few sparks of hope that get stomped out instantly by more monotonous slice of life garbage.,1
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"the manga actually kicks ass, but the anime has stunk since the invasion plot wrapped up.don't watch until they adapt the manga",1
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"How is it that the creators of Naruto can let such a huge disappointment carry on? The way this series is progressing seems as if one can already tell how they are either trying to let time pass for the manga to get further ahead before starting, or the creators are just doing what they want since it's a new series. Either way, IT'S ALL MAKING BORUTO AN OVERRATED ANIME NOW! At least in Naruto, they made canon episodes and just threw in fillers here and there. They didn't make 99% of that series fillers like how it's looking for Boruto. At this point, I'll just wait for the DVD release when I know I can buy the relevant seasons that are actually canon.",2
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"It is understandable that Boruto is growing up in a peaceful era, therefore, there is basically no problem. That is the problem of this anime. It would have been better to continue Naruto's young adult/older teens era because it would explain how the village became a modern day city. The violence in the anime is nonexistence. The good plots are too short; for example, the Naruto vs Momoshiki had an excellent fight scene, but it was too quick. It felt rushed and when the spotlight is directed to Naruto, it is quickly moved back to Boruto. It is simple in my opinion, Boruto just does not have the environmental problems that Naruto has to become a good anime. And even when a problem does come out, it feels as if it came out of nowhere. It needs to be mysterious and hyped up like the Akatsuki. They were antagonists that were slowly being revealed and also had their own original personality. However, in Boruto, everyone's personality is like a fake Gucci belt when compared to the Naruto characters. Shikadai is too much like Shikamaru. Mitsuki is bootleg Sai with a combination of Sasuke. Boruto, obviously a lot like Naruto, but wants to be a Sasuke so bad. It needs to be like the relationships in Naruto/ Naruto Shippuden. Asuma was the son of the third Hokage, but did not act like him. He had his own unique personality. This is what Boruto needs. The character development is like a copy and paste with a mix of other characters. It needs to be unique, but it is just not there. Conflict in this anime is too weak! Fillers and plot are all the same. I love Naruto and Naruto Shippuden, but Boruto is just a massive disappointment. Do not rush character development, because it has ruined Boruto so far. Despite that, I will continue watching the canon episodes, but for the people watching the first 100 episodes or so, expect disappointment to come.",1
boruto-naruto-next-generations,This anime pales in comparison to its predecessor. Naruto had good character development within the first couple of episodes that layed down the foundation for their great characters. However with Boruto it feels like your'e watching care free kids screw around with no real purpose. Also the amount of fillers is ridiculous. I know that the show has to do it to keep up with the manga but I'd rather have a break thank some half assed episodes. We're on episode 86 so far and non of the arcs have been good besides the Chuunin exams (Which was already made in movie form) and the very first arc. The pacing is incredibly slow and it makes me wish that the village could be fucking annihilate already so that these kids can gain some conviction and grow as characters.,1
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"Okay guys, let's be honest: ""Everyone has their OWN opinion."" - That being said, understand that not everyone is going to enjoy uncharted anime. Boruto is a spin-off the original Naruto series, but having a closed mind, defeats the purpose of watching it. - When you think about it, the original ""Naruto"" journey came to an end; much like most anime (such as dragonball, dragonball z, etc.) - Not comparing these 2 anime alike, just the time frame. >> Every story has a beginning and an end. >> I've been a Naruto fan since it first aired back in 2005 (America) and 13 years later, am I a bit biased...""Of course!"" But asking questions that only the developers of the series can answer, won't change anything. >>> I'll end with this, ""Watch the anime, Open-Minded,"" and just appreciate it. Much like anything else in life, ""You're not ready, Until it happens."" So decide for yourself, if this spin-off is for you and if not, just move on to the next anime. ~ Have a great day!! (｡◕‿◕｡)",1
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"So far I really want to say I would recommend it but I really can't at this state in the anime. This anime has such a huge potential to explore the other side of the world that Naruto is set in, but as it currently stands almost all of the episodes so far wouldn't have been missed. The reason for this is because they honestly just feel like they are there so the manga can get a headstart. That means that most of the episodes so far have felt lacking in writing and importance and that makes them very dull. I won't start getting into the characters since this anime is basically a follow-up to Naruto and Naruto Shippuden just for the ""younger fans"" and that's why most of the characters are blatant copy paste from the Naruto story (although their personalities differ in some of them).But I would definitely recommend to start watching when the anime starts with the ""main"" content of the manga, but as it stands right now it certainly is not more than 3 stars (The only reason it got 3 stars was because of the film arc which gave us one of the best made fights in perhaps the whole of Naruto), but of course that very well might change in the future.",3.5
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"The first 50ish episodes are actual garbage. Hands down the most boring thing to watch. BUT! They've finally started to get to the point of the movie and have altered the timeline from the movie, I hope I don't eat my words, but I can see this finally starting to become an anime worth watching. Currently, they're on episode 60 and I am starting to care and watch with actual interest. Lets give it another 5 episodes and see if they're going to give us an incredible show like Naruto or give us some seaseme street, watered down, trash.",3.5
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"I think this has something against the so called ""Yutori"" people in Japan. First of all, don't think that should be the main topic of a ""Ninja"" anime. Secondly, I don't think they fully understand what kids are really thinking because most of the problem the characters carry is solved by ""okay let's be friends"" or ""Hey, I'm a genius"" and Boruto and everybody else practically doesn't need to work for it when Naruto had to risk his life each time. Thirdly, there's no one who actually scolds Boruto for his actions like Iruka Sensei in Naruto. Lastly, I believe an anime becomes really cool because they have a strong belief instead of whining all the time or goes through obstacles which they actually have a hard time overcoming. King of the Pirates, Hokage, etc. The obstacle in this anime is all mental and not physical and seems like the age rating became PG. I guess now that Japan's PTA (Parent Teacher Association) could basically criticize everything that's not fit for their children, it became this way. Wasn't really expecting this from a battle main anime.",2
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideHonestly, i have heard a lot of bad stuff about Boruto and how it isn't going as fast and isn't having as intense battles as the series Naruto so far- and there is sorta of a reason why i feel like this is so. In Naruto the original series there was already battles among other lands and risk of war- it was basically always in the horizon- just look what Itachi saw as a kid. he saw hundreds of dead shinobis! It was a darker time back then. the first battle in the manga and series was of team 7 leading a man to his bridge he was building- but it then ended up that this man was actually targeted for death .Now look at the series Boruto.the end of a war already happened. the land is all in peace from our knoledge so far- so why would there be any huge battles? it makes sense that Boruto is having more of a calm childhood at this moment in time. If there was instantly a intense battle so early in this series (20 episodes and under) Then what did Naruto risk his life and his teams life for?! see my point? The battle with shin felt more like a filler to make it at least have some fighting aspects to it. But I feel like around the 60-70th episode they will start showing dark spots in the Boruto series and start killing off characters.. i feel like we just all have to wait until that exact time does come. that's why im rating it 5 stars.. i feel like there trying to put character development a little bit more forward and putting the ""happy"" times forward while they actually can. since again- remember. the war JUST ended, and the battle on the moon technically hasn't happened yet in the series- so. let me try to explain this the best way i can- Boruto wants his father to actually pay attention to his family. and he hates his father for it! now. if we go to the first part of Boruto and that small cut scene. he believed in the way of the shinobi and he was willing to risk his life for his father once again- so there has to be some sort of ""trigger"" to change Boruto like that. (maybe he just matured, or even a huge battle changed him?) We just all have to wait for the right time i guess. but when that time comes- I feel like Boruto will actually be known as a good anime. if someone actually reads this, im so sorry you had to witness my rant xD",1
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"So I should preface this by saying that I'm not a huge Naruto fan. I enjoyed the series for what it was, but I was never quite head over heels for it. Boruto's cast of young students remind me of my own youth, and has more of a emotional pull at times. Not to insinuate that people couldn't relate to the original series. For me, the idea of having to grow out of the shadow that was your parents is something that hits home for me. Many of the cast are trying to deal with those very issues. Constantly being compared to members of your own family, and being reminded of your lineage. It made you feel small and uninspired, having the opposite of the desired effect. In fact, many of the issues these kids face are things I've seen many friends go through time and time again. It's what makes their struggles, triumphs, and failures speak to me. If I had to give any criticism, it's that the comedy can fall pretty flat for me, I feel like the comedy characters aren't portrayed as they could/should be, and they tease too hard about Boruto's potential power. It's a long wait between now and Baruto Shippuden, so it's ever slightly so annoying to see that. Besides that, I enjoy the show quite a bit. Can't guarantee all Naruto or any viewer will have the same experience I do, but it's worth checking out.",1
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"When I first saw it I was like oh god, but then as it went on it got way better. For those saying that Boruto is way worse than Naruto, think about this...-Naruto has been around for a long time and has obviously a huge following (so naturally when it ended people wanted to see more of Naruto not Boruto)-Nostalgia is a huge factor because many people watched Naruto when they were kids. It's hard to let go of something you loved as a child.",1
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"Naruto was what got me into anime and its great to see him still going strong after all these years. By the way for people talking about filler, you are wrong. The director for the anime tweeted a while ago that Kishimoto ( the creator of Naruto) is heavily involved in each episode and says ""expand on that"" ""I want more of this character"" So its just expanding on things the didn't have time for in the manga, which I think is great!",1
boruto-naruto-next-generations,First if you are expecting the same level of maturity in the story line as Shippuden than you might be disappointed. Likewise if you are expecting to see a lot of the OG cast as adults. However it is good show that is reminiscent of the tone of the Naruto series. The story is a slow build but the characters are interesting and the story line is decent and the running jokes are amusing. Overall it is worth a watch and is at least an improvement on some the god awful filler arcs they gave us in the Shippuden series lol!,2
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"Both for fans of the original Naruto show, and those looking for a place to start with the franchise Boruto offers a consistently excellent option. By making the struggle of legacy a central theme the show manages to thrive with Naruto's looming shadow, made rather literal in the first title sequence. By resetting the power scale, the world and the village are only in mild peril, with much of the conflict being returned to the characters. The action sequences are dynamic, well animated and varied, each of the characters fights in unique ways that can be appreciated on their own but add even more insight for those familiar with Naruto and Shippuden. An all around solid and highly enjoyable action show.",1
boruto-naruto-next-generations,The animations and the update to the leaf village in Boruto are stunning. There are so many colors and the buildings are huge. I believe that Boruto's sentiments toward his dad are a spit in the face to the generation that grew up watching Naruto and Shippuden. Boruto is very unlikable. I do agree that Naruto had that quality growing up but the circumstances are different. Boruto is an ungrateful kid with a strong family while Naruto had nothing.,2
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"Naruto always said ""Never give up"". That's what we need to do now, although the only good part of this show is the time travel arc so far.I believe that this show will eventually get better. If you didn't know, the manga of this show is actually good. Once the show gets to the parts with stuff like Kawaki and Jigen the show will make a come back. Hopefully when the anime catches up to all the juicy stuff it transforms from a 1/5 show to a good show.",1
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"I have watched Naruto for a long time. It is one of those shows that has earned its spot as a classic shonen jump anime. But Boruto,It had every chance to be more than it's predecessor let us start with the negatives and then move to the positive. Negatives1: Filler.The first 50 or so episodes are just a summary of a movie that was released about a year and a half ago, effectively making the entire first 50 ep's of this series filler. This doesn't include the countless episodes of filler on top of that. i would say that rougly 87% of this series, so far, is filler. 2: Uninteresting characters.Boruto has no ambition. plain and simple. he just wants to help his friends. which is normally not a bad thing. But each character in this series is either copied from Naruto, or has so little personality that it doesnt matter anyway. We have the carbon copy of Naruto, except that its a girl this time. We have Boruto. but he wants to be like Sasuke. This show as a whole is flawed to its core....and it feels like a cash grab. Please....just let Naruto, as a series, end. make a new story, with new characters. It breaks all of our hearts seeing the series milked the same way that dragon ball is...3: Story: I have followed the Naruto storyline since it was written. despite the filler arcs of Naruto, I managed to say completely interested in the storyline. Boruto has failed to keep my attention. so much so, that I am content with reading the ""spoiler free"" summary of each episode, instead of watching it. This story just isn't as interesting. far from it. PositivesAnimation: the animation, where it counts, is decent.Character backstory: somewhere in the sea of filler arc's and filler episodes, you will get some backstory to some of the characters in this show, this kind of helps you develop some sentiment with some of the characters, not all, but some of them. Naruto: Naruto is in this series, however limited, he is there. Which, I think, is the only thing keeping me watching/reading this series. Overall: 1 out of 5: This series is a cash grab. Everything about it is low effort, don't waste your time with this series like I did. Go watch One Piece instead",1
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"Unfortunately Boruto is, as I expected, a cash grab series. I heard from many that the manga is great but I'm just not interested in reading the manga. Without comparing it to Naruto, Boruto is just a bland anime with no sense of urgency or purpose in any of the arcs presented. I understand that the adaptation can not pass up the manga, so wait to drop the anime? Make it seasonal perhaps? There are too many great animes out right now and too many great animes that deserve more seasons for Boruto to ride on Naruto's reputation and then hope that it will be interesting after 600 episodes. Like another reviewer said, the content and delivery makes you feel like you are watching a cartoon for small children. Despite trying to develop multiple characters besides team 7, they just fall short on every character's development including team 7. Now after 112 episodes I've decided to tap out. If you want to put this show on as white noise, be my guest. If you want to enjoy a show with an actual purpose, this is not the show for you.",3.5
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"Let me first start by saying that I am a DIE-HARD Naruto fan. The series holds a lot of sentimental value for me and I always felt inspired and hopeful watching how team 7 overcame many challenges. There are a few things that I don't like about Boruto. For example, the new team seven is just the gene pool of the old team seven plus Mitsuki. By extension it also alludes the 3 legendary sannin of Tsunade, Jiraiya and Orochimaru. In Naruto, this inspired excitement as it felt like the successors of the 3 sannin were destined to team up together. However, in Boruto, it just feels lazy and uninspired. It feels more like they were placed together just because of their parents. Another thing I don't like is how Sasuke goes off on his own. I read previous reviews about everyone critiquing Naruto's Character development but the same can be said about Sasuke. Anyone that watched Naruto, will remember that Sasuke actually had a family, and it was only after they died that he became distant and aloof. Hence, having a family of his own, wouldn't he be present in their lives?? Lastly, I feel, in many ways, that Boruto is just a new-fashioned repeat of Naruto. Even the first official mission felt a bit like a rip-off. From the rank of the mission being higher than it should be to the saga of the bridge... All things considered, I think the series has potential and it's really not the end of the world. I like that Naruto has flaws as a bad parent, because this is more realistic. it speaks to how exhausting the job of the hokage is as well as the lack of parental love Naruto received as a child. I also think the next arc speaks to the fact that no matter how different we think we are from our parents, we tend to turn into them. The creators and developers also highlight the differences in ideologies between generations. What was once idealistic becomes wrappped up in 'red tape' and a new form of idealism is born. I think great things are coming in time, i just hope it's not a direct copy of Naruto.",3.5
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"This anime is functioning off the premise that unknown powers are looming from the Naruto series that will show its ugly head later on... but now that I'm on episode 100, I see there was little direction to that end - making Boruto look like a disorganized mess. There are too many missed parts of the story that are disjointed and will leave you thinking, ""How does this tie into the more developed plot from the beginning?"" You'd be right with that thinking 100 episodes in. Don't get me wrong, each episode (or prolonged interlude)is kind of enjoyable, but the character development and plot switching leaves you wanting... The goals of the main character are disjointed from the plotlines of the show, disjointed is a really nice word to describe this show now that I think about it. Think about it like this, How many episodes do you need to develop a good plot, develop good characters, and follow that plot until you end a good season? definitely not 100",2
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"Let's start with the positive stuff to get it out of the way in all honesty. 1) Boruto has some likeability to him, he's got great potential as child of Naruto and Hinata genetic lineage there's a huge potential for some crazy level ups and as a Naruto fan, you quickly see new but similar skills with their 2.0 version of the previous Main character from Naruto. 2) Not giving into the spoiler but I will say that the outlook combined with being a dumb fan with hopes I guess,  I'm still to this day interested in the actual real storyline of this anime main content.Those 2 things has the merit, in my book,  to get a genuine 2 starsLet the other side of this mess of a anime;It took me time to realize the production value of this show is catered to a proper 8 year olds audience. As a 30 something Man, I feel I'm kind hearted enough to like a more teen-driven anime and legit kid-stuff like Pokemon, is just a no for me. So if you're a big Corporation that milks on a success forever, it has a lot more chance to grow has a brand, if they start with a thing that was similar to the first 2-3 seasons of Naruto. (goofy but funny, I was younger, the Anime genre wasn't exactly what it is today either. I like it!)They want us to continue watching this without a care in the World about the quality of the show which here for some odd weird reason decided to go not 100% pure manga + filler content like Naruto. To touch on this point real quick; the pacing or the lack of pacing in this case is hurting the show. Which going out of the Manga storyline shouldn't have been. You either commit to go all out or semi-out like Walking Dead e.i. but looking at how quick 150 episode of Naruto then follow by 450+ episode of SHippuden. 20 years+ in 600 episodes-ish is not bad at all! we're at what year 5 with 100 episodes (i've personally watched) nothing happened yet.The progress shown from Boruto is consistently put in comparison with Naruto, from a storyline point of view, it keeps me captivated, I think about the glimpse of memories that flashes back from the previous Naruto and feel: ""this is a good moment, it's why I watch the show"". But then, that same moment is tainted by Chocho, the worst character of the whole serie. She is simply put annoying and brings nothing to the table; the worst filler- arc is hers for a long time until a later one get even worst but that's the point. The overall filler doesn't feel like there's some attempts. It's like there's complacency in being that name that doesn't have to fight to keep their place in the next Anime season. But it's because the content has ben dumbed down to the point of being watchable if my brain was 7-12 yo. I mean,past that age, I can't imagine a older teen being into Boruto. It's too dumb! It hurts me to watch it. It doesn't get better. Like other Reviewers you may have read before mine says; Yeah, it's true! the good part is at mid-50-60 episodes and it's in the movie, so it doesn't take long that all this god dang hope you accumulated from baring with it until then just....slowly vanishes until you write a review to explain why people should wait until the show is over.There's a bunch of Anime Youtuber reviewing Boruto with some similar title like: Boruto doesn't suck anymore as clickbait for me and you to watch and see if he/she can give you some hope that will make you take the hit and watch the whole damn thing because you're a ""completionist"" and you don't want to miss out on a small ""inside"" a stupid filler may have provide at some point....",1
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"Ah yes, a continuation of a beloved series following their children. Honestly, I think it would be more interesting if the Main character was Himawari. I got to Episode 80 and the TLDR of the series is ""How many times can we insert Chocho into this story?"" Seriously, there's more Chocho episodes than Sarada episodes. Sarada's even a really good character. AH, and 80 episodes in Boruto still hasn't grown as a character while all other characters have.",1
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"The best way to describe boruto is episode 136-220 of original naruto. Entertaining filler. Say what you want about naruto having so much filler, but it wasnt this bad!! Every arc after the chunin exams is basically pointless and leads you nowhere. I'm convinced that this show is a slice of life anime with decent action. There is nothing wrong with that but this show is basically a continuation of one of the most popular SHONEN anime of all time",5
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"As a pitch Boruto would sound like this,""Imagine a ninja world at peace, where all the children of our beloved Naruto characters live. The children all have potential to be great, but since the world is at peace the story has to explore the day to day monotony of being a ninja. As the children develop we'll have them face issues like terrorism, extraterrestrial invasion, and diplomacy issues. As for the main characters, we'll make them all really strong and smart, so their fight scenes can be like the later episodes of Naruto, before Shippuden. All the character's have their major tropes with flaws which viewers will relate to, but we'll never go too far into any one character's development, instead we'll world build with random plot points... etc...."" (This pitch probably was tangential, and spoke around points till it seemed like a good idea.)The key take away, -Boruto fails to maintain a steady pacing.-The arcs don't feel like a cohesive story.-The power level structure is different than the original series. -Plot devices are poorly used, and left unexplained.This series has the potential to become great if the writers created a story board for the overall series.",3
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"This whole series is honestly a giant storm of fillers to a story that has yet to be laid out. Some stories are somewhat alright but in no way, shape, or form help the story telling. There's probably been one arc that actually impacted the main story line in the 100 episodes that have came out, and that arc was in the beginning of boruto when he kills one of the gods. Other than that, the entire show is pointless. Me being the idiot i am, I keep watching it expecting it to get better... but it just doesnt",3
boruto-naruto-next-generations,Each time I think the story might progress in a meaningful way. The flame is stomped out and you have to try to rebuild that fire in hopes that it might become something great. Nothings truly happened after 100 episodes in my opinion. That or they could of easily made it 15 episodes or good content with an actual purpose and motive to get stronger to defeat some evil but all they do is a bit of interest here and there and then back to fillers. Oh well there's plenty of good anime out there. I'll just have to set this one aside. Hopefully just forget I ever gave it a good shot. 2 stars since I didn't totally hate it. Just disappointed in how it has gone.,1
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"To be honest, I was so hyped when boruto came out but it was just filler after filler. There was only one good episode which was the Naruto, Sasuke, and Boruto fighting together. The show is too moody, jealousy, and HEAVY friendship relationships. The character Boruto is not that good either. He doesn't have an apparent goal, he is to whiney, and the only thing that makes him special is that special eye of his. It's just a bad show for people who watched Naruto. This is my 3rd time watching naruto because there is not that many good anime and it's filled with action scenes. Even in some parts it makes shed a tear. It is that good! A boy who was unappreciated by the whole village because of the 9 tailed foxes inside him and he works his way to the top. Boruto is just a kid that is loved and appreciated by his family and friends and still complains that his dad is not there with his family. At least if the director made it where a big threat is threatening all the villages, and the kids are trained to fight and kill and learn the true meaning of life, that would be interesting",5
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"As a huge fan of the Naruto series, I had high hopes for Boruto. Severely disappointed, no cool abilities or anything remotely interesting to watch. It's the same moves/combo's time and time again with nothing new thrown in. Slight glimmer of hope early on when Boruto was marked by Momoshiki and nothing since. It's more like a young children's show based on showing just friendship and good vibes. Oh, and you thought Naruto had filler? Boruto says hold my beer...",4
boruto-naruto-next-generations,Honestly this show feels like a slice of life in the Naruto universe which is not a good thing at all. 113 episodes in (at the time of writing this) and only about 5-7 episodes were actually good enough to meet the requirement of being enjoyable. Every other episode feels like a chore to get through. It is really upsetting because there was so much potential in this show but after TWO YEARS since it's release nothing has happened in the plot at all with the exception that Boruto has stopped hating his dad so much after the first 50ish episodes.,5

boruto-naruto-next-generations,"This is filled with bad fillers. And the story doesn't match up at all. Right when I thought it would take me somewhere into the plot, it gets absolutely nowhere. The story is meaningless and the plots don't add up, it doesn't get anywhere. I give it a chance simply because many people were talking about it and I wanted to try to see if I'd actually enjoy the show, but of course, I did not. Boruto is similar to Naruto but worse in my opinion.",3.5
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"Going into detail would take a HUGE paragraph, so I'm just gonna say that - at least in comparison to Naruto - Boruto is a disappointment and almost an insult to fans of the franchise. The Anime is just a really bad try of japanese studios to get some more money out of the thing, the story is an effortless copy and the animations are decent at best. The whole Kara thing (don't even know if the anime is already there yet) is a poor man's Akatsuki and they didn't even try to implement some new or interesting characters. The new protagonists are literally their parents, with basically the same Jutsu and looks. Switching up the whole Hokage dream between Sarada and Boruto is nothing but a lazy switcheroo as well...Don't even get me started on the Manga, which I legit could not keep reading after they raped and changed so much about the original cast that me and my friends simply couldn't believe it. I highly recommend watching the original Series + Shippuuden, but please do the world of Anime a favour and do not watch or support this mess of a Shounen.",5
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"I had seen loads of bad reviews on Boruto, mainly about it being a copycat of Naruto or the fights being quite short, but after watching 99 episodes I can definitely say I will stick with this show 'til the end.I haven't watched Naruto before so I can't comment on whether it is a copy or not, but what I can say is that this show is really enjoyable and funny whilst also having some scenes that made me cry my eyes out. Most of the characters in this show have likeable personalities and there are a couple of great character building arcs. The art style in this show is amazing plus the fight scenes in this show are usually quite impressive. Some episodes of this show I have to admit are a little boring and I did skip pass a few, however, on the most part this show thoroughly surpassed my expectations and I definitely urge others to check it out.Overall I can't wait to see where Boruto will go and I know I will enjoy it.btw this the first review I have written so sorry if the layout isn't great or it's short. <3",5
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"I was so hyped when I heard that they were gonna continue the series. I was mind blown when i saw future Boruto and i honestly thought this might be a better anime than Naruto. I was wrong, this anime progresses way to sluggishly, the character designs are wack and do I even need to bring up the fact that they gave Sarada an Uchiha glasses. The only reason i gave this anime a three star was because of the intro in the first episode where we saw future Boruto and because i still believe they can fix this anime.",3
boruto-naruto-next-generations,This is like when a movie series keeps going even though it shouldn't and becomes a joke... Such a stupid idea and poorly executed show!  This show doesn't have any real charm or connect with good character development. I will leave out that it doesn't establish the originally characters development properly... Boruto as a anime should be stopped its not a good idea to keep going with!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,5
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"Really tried to give Boruto a chance but the only thing it has going for it is when the old characters show up. No good character development the only reason to care about characters is because of who their parents are. Instead of showing us some interesting character development and interesting plots we get some BS flash forward promising a ""great"" conflict and then maybe 1 good episode every 20-30 episodes. Don't waste your time rewatch naruto or shippuden or go watch something else entirely.",4
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"Honestly this whole anime is trash. They literally copied everything from the original anime. Same time frames, the kids are EXACTLY THE SAME, and same story lines. Just because the action and who they are fighting is different doesn't mean jack. Just like Naruto, you start taking the Test from Academy. Then fail Chunin exams where most of the finalists were the same kids. Then a ""FILLER SEASON"" of Naruto chasing Mitsuki. Sound familiar??? Each kid literally is a clone of their parents' jutsus, and even a clone of their PERSONALITIES. Don't say it's not, it literally is the same outline. On top of all, it is still STUFFED with fillers! The lack of effort in this anime is astounding. I did not want to watch Naruto 2.0. Terrible company, and anime. Have some pride, seriously.",5
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"In all manors of speaking Boruto isn't a bad anime, but just because it's not bad doesn't make it good.            My biggest complaint about this show is that episodes 48-66 are a complete copy paste of the movie and that is just absolutely disgusting. Anime by big companies may be known for filler but at least filler introduces some sort of entertainment whereas copying word for word, scene for scene, the Boruto movie is a notoriously new low.           Moving on from my hate, Boruto is slow progressing and this is mainly because they are duplicating the essence of Naruto's plot line where you start off with the kid version of the main character. A few years down the road, they will time skip, and everyone will be more powerful with more powerful enemies. My biggest question here ties into how I feel about DB Super, how do you top the creator of chakra as an enemy, what power can Boruto attain that surpasses the 9-tails+6-path sage powers in his dad? as far as I can tell this anime is doomed to failure as it will fall short in surpassing the mountains of progress made with Naruto.",5
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"This show is nothing more than an attempt to suck up as much money as humanly possible out the Naruto series. It is an utter let down compared to the story and plot of the previous show. Boruto had great potential, however it is filled to the brim with stale and uninteresting characters, one of the most boring and unoriginal plots ever, and most of all fillers. Now I know you're thinking, well Naruto had tons of fillers too! However Naruto's plot was interesting and the characters were meaningful, but this show is just is just the greatest example of weak writing. Oh and don't get me started on the horrible animation. Naruto was known for it's incredible fight scenes and awesome animation, but the animation in this is laughable in comparison. All in all the animators know that we have been watching Naruto for 10+ years and will still come back and still watch this steaming pile of hot garbage. It's like your favorite childhood animal; it's still alive, but it has cancer, is blind in one eye, and almost completely deaf. You just don't have the nerve to put the poor thing down.",5
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"Just....just so dissapointing. It dismantles everything Kishimoto created with Part 1 and Shippuden. To have the strongest ninja in the world struggle in fights only to be shown up by his genin son.....what's the point?Don't tell me that the new generation always surpasses the previous one because not only is it bullshit for a new genin to be better than the 7th hokage, it's straight up embarrassing to watch for someone who watched Naruto from day 1, grow up to be the strongest kage, and then see this crap. No thanks.",2
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"Boruto is not Naruto, but that does not make it bad. This show is a fun look into the lives of the Konoha 12's kids and the future of the shinobi world. It's not as action packed as the original Naruto, and also not nearly as dark. However, this show is fun. Boruto's characterization in the beginning isn't the greatest, but it makes sense. Over time this series has proven that is is good. The Land of Water arc, the Chunin Exams, and even the Mitsuki arc are all entertaining. Sure there is filler, all longer running series have them, but don't count the show out just because of that. This show is just past it's first year and it has time to grow. The designs for the kids are cute and the show is wonderfully colorful. It's not Naruto, but it's still a fun watch.",3
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"The pace of this anime is absolutely awful. It is basically a repeat of the beginning of Naruto... but with less interesting characters. Some of the characters are just copy and paste, and some (like Boruto) are annoying... They are clearly extending the anime just to get some more $ out of the universe, which is so sad to me. What a terrible way to continue the legacy of what is in my opinion the best anime of all time. For those commenting ""don't compare it to Naruto, it's its own anime"", you're dumb. O F   C O U R S E   W E   A R E   G O I N G   T O   C O M P A R E   I T   T O   N A R U T O ! ! ! It is literately the exact same universe with the same characters as Naruto. I really hope Boruto gets better, but my god the characters need to change in a big way. Boruto needs to stop acting spoiled because his father doesn't have time to spend with him... He's the Hokage for god sakes of course he's too busy to be walking you through every step in life. Boruto is so arrogant and spoiled it bugs the hell out of me. Naruto acted spoiled when he was young because he didn't grow up with anyone loving him and he wanted attention. Boruto has friends, a loving mother, a sister, and he's not feared by the entire village... he's so arrogant it isn't even funny... have some respect for Naruto... I'm done ranting. Don't watch this if you are a fan of Naruto, you will be disappointed.",3.5
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"It's Finally happened. I have totally stopped caring. Let me start off by say that I am a huge Naruto fan and was incredibly excited for Boruto to come out.I knew from the get go that it was suppose to be a new show with its own feel to it but this is just bad. The main Character Boruto is a selfish little boy that gets away with EVERYTHING. I have watched over 20 episodes waiting for him to learn some sort of lesson. I thought reality would hit him when he fought against Kakashi, But NOPE. ""Power of friendship!!""(even though he treats his friends like trash) and again when it came out that he cheated in the Chunin Exams...He brings shame to his ENTIRE village and he doesn;t even get a slap on the wrist...He is unlikable, Unpalatable. .the show has to start grounding their characters. But I have all together stopped watching.",3.5
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"Growing up on Naruto, I was excited about this next chapter in the series. I watched the first 3 episodes and found myself not wanted to continue.  Few months later I forced my way through the 62 episodes.. still unsatisfied. I then realized that there were core elements missing. We cared about Naruto because he had no family. No friends, no skill and no money. He wasn't special in any way other than is grit and a mysterious demon fox spirit housed inside him. His one sided rivalry with Sasuke was enthralling. The music was perfect and would grab your heart during heart felt moments. Boruto is written and animated by different people. The music, animation and fight choreography pale in comparison to the two original series.  Boruto has everything. Loving family. Not only is he friends with everyone in his class, he is the unofficial leader of the group. His family has money, and he is so skill at ninjitsu that he doesn't even bother practicing. There is absolutely nothing humanizing about the character. To make matters worse he hates the one character that we all know and love. Naruto.... his father. Not because his father is evil or abusive. But because his father is too busy protecting the village to give him the attention he feels he deserves.And then there's Sasuke daughter. No painful back story of a murder family by the hands of your loving older brother. No just like Boruto, her father is absent.. protecting the village from afar. Instead of being a cool, mysterious bad ass like her father, she is just bossy and constantly angry. Oh.... and she has her Fathers sharigan and her mothers other worldly strength. No working hard for it. Just born with it. This anime with is animated like a Saturday morning cartoon feels like a cheap cash grab. To make matters worse Boruto seems to contradict the original works. Somehow the fifth hokage Lady Tsunada had plenty of time to drink and gamble. Yet Naruto cant even get home for a meal with his family. Naruto has so much chakra he can make 1000 shadow clones. Yet he cant divide himself between work and home effectively. Its like they don't care about the original series as long has the can pigeon hole their narrative into the series. Episode 63 was the breaking point for me. Without spoiling it. Boruto's mom puts herself into the hospital trying to save her husband from bad guys. Meanwhile Sasuke, one of the most powerful ninjas in the history of the world doesn't even sustain a scratch ""protecting"" the children. This anime has some of the weakest writing ive ever seen. Especially in comparison to the two previous series.",1
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"I'm a huge Naruto fan. I really am. But Boruto is like a huge downgrade. I like the characters except for Boruto. He's like a knock off of Naruto. Same antics, but it's like a spoiled rich kid version of Naruto. It would have been better if they showed who fell in love and how they raised their children. As hard as I tried to love this series... It really sucks! LIke watching a train wreck that you want a sweet ending to. Sorry Boruto... you get 3 stars for... well... because I love Naruto!! T_T",5
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"The series simply has a lot of potential, as did its predecessor. Some of the characters are quite interesting and the starting hook in the first episode was genuinely gripping. However...The main issue with the show is that ANY problem in this world could and SHOULD easily be handled by the Gods Naruto and Sasuke themselves. Because of this, there is no grit and where they imply that Boruto could handle something his father couldn't, it undermines everything we've been through in Naruto and Shippuden.My second issue with the show is that it's so childish in comparison to Naruto part 1. Compare the first few arcs of Naruto with Boruto; Naruto Bridge, The Forst of Death, The Chunin Exams, they all posed a major threat and had genuine grit. Boruto talked his way out of his very first threat that could have 'destroyed' the village even though Naruto was present. Boruto seems like it has forgotten how strong Naruto and Sasuke grew and how the ninja world had people pit against each other to the death for an exam...",1
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"Ok, in all seriousness, Shokugeki no Soma is hands down the most genius work to come out of Weekly Shonen Jump in a long time! It's a cooking manga sure, but at it's core it's a battle manga. Think the anime version of Iron Chef with tons of food porn and people porn. No like seriously, there's a lot of ecchi and literal foodgasms happen. It's glorious, lol. And it even has an interesting and endearing feel good story to back it all up!15 year old Soma Yukihira (Yoshitsugu Matsuoka [Kirito from SAO]) dreams of becoming a master chef like his father Jouichiro (Rikiya Koyama [Emiya Kiritsugu from Fate/Zero]), but to do that he has to graduate from Tootsuki Academy, Japan's top culinary arts academy where less than 10% of the students graduate! He makes many friends along the way including young and timid Megumi Tadokoro (Minami Takahashi) as well as many rivals like the daughter of the academy's head Nakiri Erina (Risa Taneda [Yukina Himeragi from Strike the Blood]), all while trying to fight his way towards becoming the school's top chef via the grueling cooking battles known as Shokugeki! Can Soma make it to the top?With an interesting story and concept, likable characters, a fun mix of action and comedy with cute girls and a lot of tasty food, Food Wars! Shokugeki no Soma is a must see series!NOW WATCH IT!",5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"Warning:  This series has nudity, sexually suggestive behavior, and blatantly sexual cut-scenes that make it worthy of the title of food porn.  If Gourmet Girl Graffiti was too much for you, then you won't survive the first episode here.That aside, the concept of the show is actually looking very interesting.  The acting, script, and presentation have good flow with very well done dramatic music and style to highlight important scenes.  The food scenes are done in high quality style to highlight them as great co-stars of the show.  It will be fun to see exactly where they plan on taking this crazy train, since it has already gone off the tracks.  I am anticipating great laughs, and quite a few moments of embarrassment (oddly enough) from this series as it pushes against boundaries of both taste and social standards.The story centers on a young man just ending middle school with plans to study culinary arts in the small family restaurant with his father.  Unfortunately for him both life and his father have other plans, and he is forced to attend an ultra elite culinary school in order to find his path in life.  From the very start he is facing nearly impossible odds, and has to perform one food miracle after another in order to gain a foothold in this prestigious institution.  Once he gets himself settled in the dorms he finds that each of his fellow housemates are as unique as he is, and has already caught the eyes of the most elite students due to his brazen introduction at the entrance ceremony.  From there he will face numerous challenges and set backs in his new struggle of personal and professional growth.  One thing is certain, even in the face of defeat he is entertaining us with his best efforts.",5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"This is a great anime to watch! It's very true to the manga and the quality is great for the anime, top notch! Very great comedy and the way the animate and draw the reactions and food! I find myself eating every time I watch this show.....So be warned!!! If you're like me, don't binge watch this anime otherwise you'll find yourself eating ALL DAY! I feel like I gain a few pounds per episode- I can't help it since this show makes the cooking look so damn good!I recommend watching a sports anime after to counter the effects like Eyes Shield 21, or Hajime no Ippo to motivate you to work out afterwards.Great anime! You won't be bored or disappointed!",5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"This anime is truly amazing!!! I really love the story and the amount of action is in this anime. Of course I didn't have any expectations when I first started watching. I always thought this anime was going to bore me, but boy was I wrong. This anime did the exact opposite! This anime hooked me in and I can't stop watching and I'm seeking for the new episode almost everyday! I REALLY RECOMMEND THIS ANIME TO PEOPLE WHO LIKE ACTION, FUNNY ,AND FOOODDD!!",5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"This series is great so far, I have enjoyed the manga since I picked it up a couple months ago and this anime is doing it a great service. The animation is great and the characters are fun and interesting, unfortunately the story starts off with the fan service being rather heavy handed to hook people in and get them interested in the story and characters, it does become more tolerable as the series goes on but if you can't handle the first 3 episodes than it might be best to just move on. Still it is worth a look and if you can stomach the fan service you may be able to see just how great this story gets further down the road. Yes the foodgasms are a little too intense sometimes but it tones down for the most part later in the series, at least it did in the manga.",5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,The story revolves around Yukihira Soma a 15 year old boy who transfers into japans most elite cooking school. Just a heads up though if you really don't like ecchi anime this may not be for you. However you would be missing out as the charm of this show is both its intense cooking animation and its food-gasms This series is through the roof amazing from the quality of the animation to the outrageous-ness of the show I've never seen such well drawn food in an anime and I can't wait till later when it the intensity is high.,5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"As stated in the title the first two seasons were great, but with all things that start out at the top, they have no where to go but down.  In the first two seasons you get a lot of character development mixed with comedy and some seriousness. The latter half (so far) has been much of the same food scenes, nothing new really from the first couple seasons.  It just seems like they ran out of ideas.  Lots of ""oh whats this magical thin layer hidden within this otherwise normal food that drives it above perfection?!?""  They use this idea many, many times through out the entire series.  Once they hit the main story arc, its all Shokugeki's and no new development really.  The fan service throughout the series might be a little too much for me.  Literally anytime anyone eats anything they have a fantasy where they are mostly naked and making lots of sexual noises.  Even when someone tastes Soma's (the main protagonist) failed experiments (mostly involving squid tentacles), they ""feel like"" they are being assaulted by tentacles in sexual manners.  Overdone fan service just turns me off of some animes.  I feel like its the ""easy"" thing to do now a days to drive interest in adolescents.  The main story develops slowly throughout the first couple of seasons, which i could see why they drew it out so long, because its just mainly a meh story.  Bad guy wants to take over the school, recruits the top talent in said school to ""overthrow"" the people with imagination and make food that has no innovation in it and follows recipes to a T.  But I don't even get it because the top talent that the main antagonist has recruited are coming up with innovative recipes to serve during these Shokugekis.  You can tell they are ""innovative"" by the peanut galleries reactions when their dish is revealed.  Lots of ""OH MY GOD, HOW COULD THEY POSSIBLY ACHIEVE SUCH BALANCE IN THIS COURSE?!"" The Shokugeki scenes (especially in season 4) are quite boring to me and I find myself skipping through half of them to advance the plot.  This is probably due to the fact that I feel like I've seen the same development in every shokugeki through out the entire series.But with all its downsides its still something to watch and has its entertaining moments. That's why I give it 3 out of 5 stars.",5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"Growing up, I happily enjoyed watching cooking shows with my mother, as I played with toys in the living room floor. I liked watching her cook, and when I grew, I began joining in. I remember one Christmas, I received an Easy Bake Oven, an unusual toy for a boy, but I couldn't have been happier. Now, at 27, I pride myself on my own recipes and ability as a chef. When Shokugeki no Soma was announced for an anime adaptation, it  was [cleverly] marketed to be as ""Iron Chef: the Anime."" Intrigued, I picked up the manga immediately and fell in love by the end of Chapter One. The tight, snappy art style and character design struck me immediately and as I read, I adored each new character and savoured every challenge, every dish presented therein a delight to my eyes and imagination. The beauty of Shokugeki no Soma is that this isn't as advertised- it's not a simple set of battles in Kitchen Stadium. While the Shokugeki is an important part of the narrative, Shokugeki no Soma is a shounen. As you read on and/or continue to watch, you see Soma and Co. mature and grow, even right down to the length of their HAIR. You watch them struggle and learn and sharpen their skills while forming relationships and looking toward futures brighter than one can imagine. The story evolves, much like Soma's transforming furikake gohan served to Erina at the beginning of the story. Framed as a coming of age story with a premise of school life, the use of food battles known as Shokugeki spice up the story enough in between character interactions in a way that facilitates growth. Speaking of Spice, let's talk specifically about this adaptation, beginning with sound design. The ED of the first season, Spice by Tokyo Karankoron, is an absolute delight, with every ED and OP to follow adding something great to the energy of the show. The music found throughout the episodes is wonderful and dynamic, covering a range of motifs as broad as there are cuisines, from character themes to battle themes and beyond. The effects are also a delight, from bubbling pots to swift, snappy chops, the sound design is believable and appropriate. Visually, the show ranges from your standard faire of high school life and kitchen shenanigans to outright foodgasms using hyperbolic exaggerations of the taster's reaction to the main ingredients in a given dish. Let's not forget the main attraction- the show's about food, so the food in this looks absolutely amazing. Veggies look crisp, meat looks fleshy and fatty, and liquids look smooth and clear. The show has its moments where it looks slightly generic when focusing on just simple character action, but during the drama, which there is a lot of, and the action, which is also aplenty, the detail is kicked into overdrive and the show really comes into its own. The animation follows this principle to match the art quality. The characters are loveable and dynamic- noone gets left behind and every main and relevant side character experiences a range of emotions and experiences which goes a long way towards making them feel real.Altogether, Shokugeki no Soma is an array of tasty little morsels served up to you in a tight, neatly wrapped little bento that you can't help but be both satisfied by and ready for seconds after. 9/10, this faithful adaptation only suffers a one point loss for those moments in which the visual quality takes a backseat during lighter moments. It has become one of my three favourite modern anime and I cannot wait for it to catch up to the incredible manga, which by the way gets a complete 10/10 for me. OAGARIYO.",5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,This show. This show makes you hungry. ... And Wet. If you like PLOT and omelettes. This is the right show for you! On a more serious note. This show is very entertaining and promising throughout. Not a single episode left me bored yet each one had a nice cliffhanger to further intensify my  hunger for the next episode. Eh? Eh??? ... No? Alright. Bye! ZippNex.,5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"“Repeating trial and error and failing many times… it’s that process which makes the dishes shine.” – Soma YukihiraFood Wars! Shokugeki no Soma is a Japanese shounen manga series written by Yuuto Tsukuda and illustrated by Shun Saeki. Yuuki Marisaki also works as a person, providing the manga creator with the recipes. An anime adaptation by J.C. Staff aired between April 3 and September 25, 2015. Meet Souma, he is the son of the owner of a small eatery in Japan. For his age, Souma is a very talented person able to easily come up with new dishes; sometimes these dishes are some really weird combinations of the ingredients no one would ever use. After some time, the owner of the Souma’s eatery, Souma’s father, leaves the family business to work with his friend. Souma’s restaurant is on the verge of closing. To improve his cooking skills and to save the restaurant, Souma begins studying in Engetsu Teahouse Culinary Academy, which is regarded as Japan’s top culinary academy. The problem is that only a few are able to graduate from it, these few are world’s best gourmet of culinary. Will Souma manage to graduate from the academy? Well, this is difficult one to review. Food Wars is a very unusual anime that is worth watching for many reasons. It is interesting to watch, since it does a great job with tension. The main genre of the series, as I see it, is SoL. Yet, there are so many action scenes that you cannot believe that what you are watching is not an action series. In Engetsu Teahouse Culinary Academy, only the strong have the right to decide. So long story short, whenever you do not agree with something, you duel. No, they do not duel to death. Whenever a conflict might appear, the students have a culinary duel.  They cook some dishes and have judges assess their creation. And this is so cool. This might sound lame and boring, however, the creator of Food Wars managed to make these duels amazingly epic to watch. Animation wise, Food Wars has some amazing animation: from character designs, to amazing action scenes. Cooking has never been this epic. There are so many colors that you cannot close your mouth from amazement. Sound wise, Food Wars has an okay OST and some great Japanese voice acting. I highly recommend you to watch it subbed. The main protagonist of Food Wars is Yuukihira Souma. He is only fifteen, but he is already a highly talented individual, who just wants to take over the family’s business. To achieve that goal, he fights with the business woman in the region, where he lives, who wants to buy the restaurant. Souma’s father tells his son that only if he graduates from Totsuki can he succeed both in the business and in surpassing his old man. The problem is that only 10% actually graduate the academy. Anyways, aside from Souma, there are many other interesting characters to follow. What is more, even supporting characters are quite interesting. Enjoyment wise, this show is so enjoyable to watch that you cannot stop watching the series; you want more and more. There is an ecchi grain in it, but it is never unnecessary; it only shows how amazing the food is the foodgasms are real.Overall, it is a real gem. Warning: never watch Food Wars, when you are hungry, or you might regret it. Never before have I seen something even close to Food Wars. Great job Yuuto Tsukuda.10/10.",5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"This is one of those animes that I couldn't recommend more.The food is absolutely amazing and as a person who loves cooking I've tried a bunch of the recipes from the anime and they legit work. I am just impressed. It shows the passion for food, cooking and the grueling life of a chef. The manga writer wanted to make that point and I think the anime shows it damn well. If you aren't a fan of cooking I wouldn't be surprised if this turned you into one. Solely because of that I think anyone can enjoy this anime. There are more seasons after this one and oh boy are they all good.The character development is there along with the absolutely stunning art. I mean if you can draw and animate food that makes me loose my shit then you are doing a great job.",5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,Food wars ehmmm.. Anime about cooking that’s great for somobody who like food nor cooking. But when you watching anime about food plus that anime is eechi. That’s like eating very spicy chilli peper. Overall  for 1st season I never felt like there was something boring  .2nd season was mostly about yukihira changing but it was also wery good not boring.So come here and watch till the end.3rd season was so full of tension. I really enjoy it or more like to say savour it.I can’t wait to watch the 4th season. Clearly 5 stars,5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"Do you like the aesthetic of battle anime, but wish it were less violent and more slapstick? Do you abhor fighting and wish nothing but pure joy and ecstasy for all the characters involve? Do you love food and reminisce about the over the top reactions of older shows such as Yakitate Japan? Well then you have very specific taste and may want to broaden your horizons, but not today because today you're gonna be binge watching this anime all day long. You can worry about what to watch afterwards haha XD",5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"Food wars! made a great impression on me (anime only) when they had great visuals/animations with a satisfying soundtrack. The anime is definitely an ecchi anime that went a little too much foodgasms, but drastically toned down the foodgasms in episode 2. The series does an excellent job at making me want to come back because of how the episode ends. Food wars! overall is an interesting anime that manages to corporate food/cooking with humor to create probably one of the best spring 2015 anime. The show isn't for everyone, but if you manage to get past the first episode, I recommend that you stick with this anime.",5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"I've been waiting for this anime ever since I started reading the manga and it's a completely new genre for me. I love to cook but I've never been into reading about it. I like comedies but always shied away from comedy anime/manga. Well, Food Wars changed all of that for me!        I bought Food Wars as a digital manga for three bucks, thinking I would gift it to a friend. But then I downloaded it for myself and I've been hooked. Ever since, I've been scrounging the internet for the tiniest bit of information about the anime and here it is!        The cooking process is much more detailed than I thought it would be in terms of showing what's what and Soma describing his cooking secrets. It was action-y, which is what made me so interested in Food Wars! in the beginning.       Given the explicit nature of the manga with the foodgasms and such, I wasn't sure if they would be dialed down or turned up in the anime. I was wrong on both accounts; the foodgasms happen just as they did in the manga only animated with a bit of artistic twist. Soma is just as wonderful and is true to his character. I was a little afraid they would change him ^^;       Overall, I see the beginnings of a great anime from this first episode. And the ending was perfect: with just enough of a cliffhanger to make wish the second episode was already here!",3
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"Adaption-WiseJust a bit of background, the author/artist of this series was/still is a really popular Hentai Doujin artist before this series, and some of that carries over into this work. In the sense that the ecchi aspects of the scene do well to enhance the overall quality of the food reactions. The scenes are done greatly, and to hilarious effect as well where it's always fun to watch every unique reaction. The series animation keeps true to the original author's artwork, and the animation quality is top  notch as well. So far it's looking great as an adaption, and the choice of seiyuu is great. The Opening and Ending themes aren't that bad either, though lewdness might not be to everyone's taste.Story-Wise The Story of the first episode is great, and follows true to the manga while adding in their own subtleties. The first episode is great in the sense that it sets up Souma's character perfectly,  as well as getting you interested in his development. His temperament, his personality, his goal, and his bad ass moments are all wrapped up and shown in one episode. In conclusion this anime adaption is looking really great, and I look forward to where it's headed.",5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,ANIME LIKE NO OTHER. The characters? Are each captivating and unique in their own way. The animation? PERFECT. Down to the very detail. The soundtrack? PERFECT. The visualisation of global foods created? EPIC. I honestly adored this show from start to finish. All the challenges they faced and how they shaped each characters to further progress into their future was always captivating. I'm sad that I finished watching it now but I will always love this anime.,5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"Ok ima start with i love this anime and it's deffinetly on my top 3. so where to start well im not really a fan of etchi but it's not that bad in later seasons. so yhe it's an anime i didnt know i needed but cant live without. the main character is well balanced he is not to bragy but he isnt an cry baby. it's deffenitly an 5 star series and well the cooking is great i love to search up the recepies and try them myself, the anime has great character development i never though a show about cooking could be shonen and i didnt think i would enyoj it as much as i do. the animation is one of the best ones ive seen and i like how they managed to mearch the cgi with normal animation its flowing along like a river and dosent feal like out of place like many other animes feal when they do it. I REKOMEND IT FROM MY HEART",5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"I've been watching since season 1. In fact this show kept me subscribed to Crunchy when they hit a dry patch after the Funi split. The show is great because of season 1. To be honest whoever packaged that gift knew how to hook a viewer into a show. Most of the recipes are good, I haven't tried all, but they are mostly real recipes tried by real cooks. Later on they begin to improvise and there are some mistakes made; the show begins to drop the back curtain and you see the puppeteer. The writer isn't a cook or has ran out of ideas, so I wouldn't try recipes from season 3 and definitely not from season 4 unless your budget can handle you tossing prime seafood, especially if you're not an experienced cook you won't catch the errors and will ruin quality meat.Aside from that the show is really good, and asking for more than 50 high quality cooking tips from an anime is too much. So before you get angry I am criticizing the recipe in the show, please understand that I know it has overdelivered already! The action and story are pretty high octane in season 1 and 2, in fact there is so much going on, I would recommend rewatching season 1 so you can enjoy the food in more leisure without hectic reading of subtitles. Just my two cents there. Season 4 is a letdown. Not nearly as much story as 1, not nearly as much action as 2, gives one of the most antipathetic (unlikable) characters way too much screen time, and shows off the biggest hypocrite in a sympathetic way. I think the writers missed the mark with the guy and his mom, when you hear the backstory you'll know who I'm talking about in season 4. Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hide The bushido guy began discriminating based on upbringing and skills, after his mom was discriminated against for her gender. In my mind prejudice is prejudice, and you can't go around judging the quality of the finished product based on the technique of production.So season 4 is basically some fs and OK food so far ep6. But since these have been over 18 episode seasons, I think it can be salvaged. It's still OK though I am bored by the team shokugeki. I thought it will be more action since we are doing 6 entrées per battle instead of 2, but no, they simply split them up over more episodes so we're still getting one winner per episode. Some you get two but that's because the previous episode was a cliffhanger. That's another gripe with the show, cliffhangers, those got old when I was 8, a long time ago. I'm not exactly more fond of them now, they are a poor way to treat your viewer and insult the intelligence of the audience. If you have a good story to tell, your viewer will comeback anyway, no need for cheap tricks, and don't you think your audience is smart enough to see what you're doing with the cliffhangers? Cut it out!",5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"This show may seen weird at first and may think its a sexual one at that. But the more you watch you understand the love for food people have towards cooking and eating them. I love food and completely fell in love with this show and love everything about it. I love how much passion they have for cooking and tasting wonderful meals they created themselves. As well as, a learning experience. It is a MUST WATCH if you love food like I do!",5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"Food Wars is without a doubt one of the best shows on this site (and I've watched most shows on here). The art style is definitely nothing special at first glance, but the animation is extremely consistent and never lazy. The soundtrack is very memorable, featuring different themes for different characters. Food Wars is also pretty ecchi at times, but it is overdone to the extent that they just take the piss out of other, more serious ecchi anime. This goes to the point of making you laugh just at how ridiculous the scenes are, which is supported by the top notch VA. There are no other shows that manage to make me sit in my chair just giggling and grinning through entire episodes like this one does. Adding to this are well written dialogues with a lot of epic one liners that should normally just seem very try-hard but aren't for some reason. Characters in this show are also extremely memorable and rarely one-sided, giving most characters likeable traits and evolving them throughout the show.Overall, Food Wars will most likely blast all of your expectations to bits, which is especially impressive since shonen Anime is almost never truly good or consistently well produced. (Written shortly before the release of Fourth Plate)",5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,The premise isn't new but the execution is very well done has memorable characters and good pacing you really get drawn into the cooking battles and I enjoyed it a lot. My only real problem with this series is the gratuitous amount of unnecessary teaser fan-service and I'm one that usually doesn't care about that either way but this anime would have been just as good without it. I'm giving a low 5 on here and a 8.5 on a 10 scale. It has a really good English dub on Sentai's new anime channel Hidive check it out.,5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"Huh... where do i start? Food Wars is one of those unique anime titles that you've never seen before. It perfectly executes something new and refreshing, while keeping the plot interesting and fun to watch.STORY  It resolves around a student named Yukihira Soma, a teenager who enlists to the ""Tōtsuki Culinary Academy"" to follow his father's footsteps, while meeting new friends and learning new things about cooking. It keeps things interesting with it's ""Food Wars"" , which surprisingly keeps you at the edge of the seat.5/5 ANIMATION Simply superb. The food that you will be looking at in this Anime will make your stomach grumble violenty, so many times have i wanted to jump at the screen and taste the delicious things they were cooking!But this is where the bad part is, the facial animations. They become stale? boring? annoying? I don't know how to describe it. The first two seasons executed this perfectly, making you laugh at the funny moments, but seeing the same constant thing over and over again in Season 3 makes it really stale and uninteresting. Konosuba! does this perfectly, seeing different funny faces makes it refreshing and constantly funny, and it is one of the things i hope that Food Wars will improve on.I almost forgot to say about the ""clothes ripping"" after they try their food.It is also really hilarious the first two seasons, but it also quickly becomes repetitive and cringey over time.3/5 SOUND/MUSIC The music in this anime is really good. They make their Shokugeki's intense and suspenseful, constantly keeping you at the edge of your seat. Nothing much can be said around here.5/5 CONCLUSION As i said before, this anime is unique and something new in it's genre. It's one of the animes that i will gladly come back to if they make a new season (and let's be honest they probably will) and i really hope that they improve in their animation aspects.4/5",5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"I was honestly impressed with the flow of the story plot. When I first heard of this anime being a cooking show, I thought to myself, how long will this show last, but now I can't wait every week for a new episode. The story plot may seem like it may be slow for every episode, but it would make sense since making of anime and manga are on two different speed. And besides, I thoroughly enjoy the pace that it is moving at since it always leaves some kind of cliffhanger to the next episode. Greatly recommend this anime to anyone who has never seen anime, or want to start watching anime.",5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"It's badass cook offs -aka a ""Shokugeki""- are the best parts of the show. It's literally shounen inspired cook offs where you put getting expelled from the academy (or whatever of value you are willing, or not so willing, to lose) on the line if you lose. It'll get your mouth salivating, and I'm not just talking about the delicious looking food (*notices ecchi tag*) (͠≖ ͜ʖ͠≖)A solid 5/5 stars for me.",5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"WOW. Just wow. This adapted the manga wonderfully, and did not fail to impress me who's re-read every chapter of the manga. It's really ecchi, with good art, character development, and plot. I'll say a little more below.Art: No need to say, the art style is clean and good, and is probably the art style that I most enjoy.Characters: Some people who only watched the first few episodes say that it's boring how Souma always wins, but that's only the start. His character develops to be a lot more interesting than a fuckboy that always wins. Megumi, who had little confidence in the beginning, also begins to build up more confidence. Then there's Erina. She's on a whole different level.Each of the characters that the story focuses on all develope well, which I thought was really neat.Plot: The plot is just a freaking roller coaster of a ride. A good one for sure. There's never an episode that's boring because things are always happening. Spoiler Alert!

food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"This anime is much, much better than one would get from catching just glimpses of the show. I didn't watch season 1 until I had read a really compelling review in a magazine, and it lived up to hype.The animation and audio is top notch. Characters are very interesting, and you definitely are sucked into the ""action"". On top of all of that, you definitely get an appreciation for the food being made, and it is almost hard to not salivate over food, and to learn a thing or two about different forms of cuisine and they are prepared.",5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"At first the idea of a 'Food Anime' is a bit 'dull' as in the thought that it's originality or longevity would be at stake. Along with that of character development. But, I was wrong. Since Episode 1, Dish 1- I've been hooked and I show up every Tuesday to see the new Episodes. The First Season sets the parameter sand entices the viewer with foreshadowing and Character envelopment [Along with the Nice Food Porn]. Season Two hits the grand slam with the ramping excitement and trials the Yukihira endures. And Season three is where the challenging protagonist phase of realizing he is skilled, But he' not Number 1, yet. Meanwhile, they'll keep you enticed and the Ending of every episode leaves you wanting more...more...more. The Animation is fluid and nice. ALL Characters have Decent Backgrounds. And even some of the 'Enemies/Antagonists' are lovable too. I recommend 5/5 to watch this series.",5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"To preface this review, I will say that I have been watching anime since the early Dragon Ball days and have seen almost anything and everything considered mainstream/popular/hidden gems/unorthodox. And this show has managed to greatly impress me. It's obvious that a lot of love went in to making this series, from the music and animation quality, to the recipes that can be created in real life and the story being told. It is incredibly good.Starting of the first season gives you a sense of, ""what the hell am I watching"" but at the same time you cannot stop watching it at all. I marathoned all available episodes with each episode leaving me craving more. Yukihira Soma is a fantastic main character with his never quit attitude and intensity/passion toward cooking. I could sing this shows praises forever but I'll leave the review with this before diving into spoiler territory.Just watch it, seriously.",4
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"No issues with the former (other than consistently craving whatever they're cooking in each episode), but I tend to get fed up with over-the-top fan service. However I liked this show enough to overlook that. This is actually really good anime: good characters, storyline, etc. Most of the characters have their own specific cooking style and background story, and they grow in their own way as the story progresses. The main character is good but not OP by any means.",5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"Have you ever tasted something so good your clothes explode off of you and your left daydreaming in complete food-induced ecstasy completely naked? Probably sweating? This show is greatly satisfying, great visuals, great humor. Like, they are well aware how hilariously absurd the show can be. The show also inspires me to learn to cook and understand the theory of cooking more.  I want to go to culinary school now :PEdit - I also just noticed and am honestly very surprised to see there is even one 1-star review for this. I need to meet these people and observe them...",5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"Food Wars! at its heart is a story of failure.It's a story of failure as a crucial ingredient to success, even in the face of those who are incubated from it. It may be a cooking/battle shonen style work, but the story very much illustrates and eminates the whole spectrum of failure - from those like Soma who thrive off it, to those like Megumi who experience a turnaround from avoidance of failure to moving forward, to those like Erina who fear it more than anything.Failure is the spice of this world; addictive to those who savor the salvation beneath; Those who shy away from the pain never get to experience the pleasure that comes after.The plot is rich; the characters have layers upon layers; the motifs are dynamic, yet consistent in adding to the vibe of the show.Give it a taste.",5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"I have loved this anime since it first premiered! I have watched it an loved since day 1, despite not knowing if I would or not. At first the idea of an anime that is centered on food and cooking seemed interesting because I had never seen any other anime quite like it, but I didn't think it would be something I would love and wait in anticipation week after week!!! 3 seasons in and nothing has changed, it is and will remain among my top five favorite anime. Give it a try. It has a fascinating plot line that focuses on Soma Yukihira and his time at the Totsuki Culinary academy, where he meets friends, gains rivals and participates in the most epic (non-violent) battles in anime (this is culinary-shonen!) called Shokugeki. Join Soma-Kun and his pals at Totsuki as he claws his way up the elite. The Third plate: I love the introduction of the new characters, it gives an air of Soma getting closer and closer to the elite ten council. I love the first several episodes, but can't wait for more Shokugeki time! but this is really good time for Yukihira to appreciate a different form of competition cooking for the festival. It is also a good way for him to measure what he still needs to learn in order to enter the top ten council. He is still but a first year student. Also, I will never get tired of seeing Nishiki-senpai, lolol! If you have not seen this anime yet, or are debating to watch the third plate (who would do that after watching the first and second, but okay) don't wait or hesitate, the only bad part about it is the insufferable, seemingly interminable wait each week for the next episode to air!!! 5/5 rating since the first episode, it wont change!",5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"This show took the shounen genre to a realm nobody had ever previously imagined, and it does it in stunning fashion. For that, it deserves everyone's respect. Even if you don't enjoy this show(get your brain checked) you should respect it. It satisfies every kind of appetite you could possibly have all at once. The mundane became wondrous. Shokugeki, thank you for existing and inspiring the anime world. Season One, was a masterpiece in terms of script, plot, originality, characters, art, and audio. Season two picked up the pace of the show, developed the story sufficiently without wasting time.Season Three: This season expands the world of Totsuki and develops the main heroine more than anybody else. It is a shame that Erina's VA is sick, because a lot  of this arc focuses on her development. While her substitute is acceptable, she doesn't capture the original VA's haughty/dignified personality nearly as well. That being said, we can expect this show to satisfy our insatiable appetites for shounen, while making us crave the cuisine that will likely never grace our palates. While this show is airing, expect it to take the first seat in the ratings.",5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"The jokes are spot on, the animation is smooth, the story is pretty good, maybe nothing spectacularly original, but has its own quirks. The main protagonist is pretty cliche, but so are a lot of protagonists in anime. I like how each of the characters have their own cooking style and skill in a specific area instead of them just being good at everything. I'd recommend for anyone who wants a easy going anime with a few feels thrown in there.",5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"It strongly starts off with more emphasis on key components that grab an audience's attention (stripping for food), yet ends up quite the opposite.  The originator really KNEW their cooking.  There would have to be intensive cuisine experience and research into this anime, and there definitely was.  If you want to learn how to master cooking skills, you can get a lot of information out of this.  It also has very interesting comical characters.  Definitely a top rated anime.  The more I watch, the pickier I feel about ratings, but this one deserves its 5 star.",5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"I like to think of myself as someone not afraid to give a beloved anime a rating of 3 or 4  stars instead of 5 if I think it deserves it, but I just can't do that to Shokugeki here. The art is beautiful, the story and characters intriguing, and the cooking... oh, the cooking! What's not to love, right? (Besides, perhaps, the crude and somewhat ridiculous fan-service.)And always remember the cooking and the food. This show will make you so very, very hungry, so you should be careful regarding how much you watch it, if you don't want to get fat, that is.Soma and the rest of the characters are fun to watch, especially when they make really pretty food. The best moments of the show are probably either characters making fools out of themselves or, that's right, food. Whether or not you like fan-service or comedy or any of that, I think we can all agree that we like food, and therefore we should all just watch Shokugki no Soma.",5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"Shokugeki no Souma (Food Wars) is an anime about battles of cooking as the title suggests. This anime has gotten very popular in the few months it has been airing and it has also been received pretty well. But is it any good or is it just another one of those popular but dull anime, that I will discuss in this review.  Story - 8/10 You must have realized that the anime revolves around Soma Yukihira who wants to become a cook and surpass his father in cooking. Some stuff happens and Soma ends up in Totsuki Academy, which is the best cooking school in Japan. After reading the synopsis, you must have come to the conclusion that it isn't unique or special, but that doesn't make it bad. The story isn't anything even special but the other aspects of the show are so well done that it makes you feel that the story is better than it actually is.  Art and Animation - 9/10 The animation of the show, to be described in one word, is brilliant. While one can say that almost all anime that are released these days have really good animation, Shokugeki no Soma's animation is a level above most others. (while not being as good as something made by ufotable but its still very detailed and fluent). The best thing about Food Wars's art is the way they display food, it's really good. The art is consistent throughout the show and doesn't get bad at any moment. The openings and ending too are animated nicely. The designs of the characters are, for the most part, unique as well, with most characters having different designs. However, one can argue that Erina Nakiri(one of the female protagonists) looks pretty darn similar to Asuna Yuuki from SAO.  Sound - 9.5/10 The first opening is amazing; it a treat to the ears. It's just really beautiful. I cant speak Japanese so I don't read the lyrics but just listening to the opening psyches you up for the episode. The ending is really good too but it still pales in comparison to the opening. (Says how excellent the opening song is). The second opening is good, but it's more of an opening for a fighting anime. The first opening was very charming and pleasant, which suits the theme of Shokugeki no Soma. However, the second OP's tone didn't quite suit it, in my opinion. It can be still considered good, nonetheless. The second ending is very good to hear too. (And they used the first OP at the end of the final episode 24 of the anime so that means it was the best of the series) Now, on to the soundtrack, in my opinion, there lack a couple of battle soundtracks which they could use during shokugekis and stuff. There is only one track which played over and over again, during food battles or while the characters are cooking something for their tests among other stuff. The track named Shokugeki no Soma Epic soundtrack(so much for a good title) on its own is thrilling to hear and you won't probably notice how repetitive it is unless you are watching like 8-9 episodes at once. But if you do watch around 8 episodes at once, there is a chance that you will come to complaint about the limited tracks. The limited amount of soundtrack is my only critic I could have in the sound department. The voice acting is funny when required, serious and tension-building during a shokugeki, which is also another plus to the anime. Simply put, the voice acting is flawless. Characters - 9/10 The cast in this anime is pretty big, which you would expect from a shounen anime like this. There are rivals, friends, upperclassmen, etc but they have gotten pretty good screentime to express their characters. Our lovely protagonist, Soma Yukihira is just really awesome. He can be OP sometimes with his dishes but he is awesome, nonetheless. He is and is not your typical shounen protagonist. When I say he is your typical shounen protag, I look into the fact that he has a goal of surpassing someone, he is pretty determined to do that, etc. When I say he isn't, the unique features of his characters come out : his confidence, he is good at what he does, he is arrogant. Now, here his arrogance does a great job because it's really fun to see the opponent's reactions after they are brought down by his words, and most importantly, he entertains us. For an anime like Food Wars, he is the perfect protagonist. The two main female characters of the show are damn good : Megumi Tadokoro is your usual clumsy, scared girl from a small village who hopes of making it big here. While there is nothing much unique about her character as of yet, she has done her job well so far and is getting development and she does get braver as the anime progresses. Erina Nakiri is the tsundere who is also known as ""God Tongue"" because of her ability to only acknowledge the best of foods. She is the daughter of the Director(or something big shot of Totsuki at least.) and her family is one of leads in culinary restaurants and other stuff in the world. She is prideful, arrogant and would destroy anything that could stand in her way of being no. 1 in Totsuki; anyone other than Soma. Erina hates Soma and you'll know why she does after watching the first couple of episodes. The interactions between Soma and Erina are fun to watch, really fun to watch. Although, the show hasn't focused on Erina too much as of yet, but I am sure she will be getting her time in this second half. The remaining characters, too, as I said, are entertaining to watch. Some of their interactions are hilarious while some will show you the intensity of the battles happening in Food Wars. Pros : 1. Extremely entertaining. 2. Amazing comedy and you'll jump out of your seat while watching some of them.  3. Great animation and soundtrack. 4. Immensely amusing character interactions. Cons : Comedy can get out of hand sometimes with the ecchi. If you aren't a fan of ecchi, you might not like the characters' reactions after they eat the food. They get naked and act and act like they're having orgasms. A lot of people have enjoyed this but some might not. However, the good thing is that these get less and less as the anime progresses and by around episode 8, these foodgasms are reduced since the anime starts to get more serious and take off to the skies. Enjoyment : 10/10 This anime is a hell of a ride and the entertainment value of the show is right up there. The first episode is nothing compared to what the next few episodes bring to you. The thing got better and better with each passing episode.  Overall - 9.5/10  In my opinion, Shokugeki no Soma is the best anime released in the year 2015. I guess, the stats it has on MAL speaks for itself. I would definitely recommend this anime to you, even if you are not a fan of such anime, it's worth your time and I am almost certain that you won't regret watching it.",5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"you have food, sassiness, smartass, and hot characters to add to the fun.

food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"Food Wars!, or Shokugeki no Soma is a Japanese shounen manga series, which was written by Yuuto Tsukuda and illustrated by Shun Saeki. Due to big success, the manga received an anime adaptation by J.C.Staff, which aired between April 3, 2015 and September 25, 2015 and a second season, which began airing on July 2, 2016. The anime tells the story of a boy named Souma Yukihira, who has a dream to become an owner of his father's restaurant and to surpass his father as a chef. However, when Souma graduates from middle school, his father, Jouichirou Yukihira, gets a new job abroad and closes his and Souma’s restaurant. Souma cannot accept the fact that his father chooses a new work and tries to persuade his father to stay. But Souma’s father has a task for his son: Souma should become a student of Toutsuki Saryou Ryouri Gakuen and to learn to be a top-class chef. Everything seems to be easy, but after some time Souma finds out that Toutsuki is one of the most prestigious educational establishment in Japan, where only 10% of the students manage to graduate. Strange as it may seem, Souma is not afraid of his father’s challenge and he immediately decides to become a top student it Toutsuki. Will Souma surpass his father and become a pro in cookery? Find out the answer now!While the plot of this series sounds average, I want to assure you that this anime has many things to offer. Souma is just a normal young man, who does not have “money to buy everything he wants.” But his father makes him join an educational establishment that was built by the rich for the rich: almost every student of Toutsuki has a bodyguard and enough influence to do whatever they want. Funny thing is that in Toutsuki your background does not mean anything, you can be rich, you can be poor, it does not matter. You must, however, be a splendid chef. And Souma will have to fight against these monsters with millions, or even billions of dollars on their bank accounts to prove that he is better. And the most important thing about that is that Souma does not only win, sometimes he is defeated; however, his desire to become better, his desire to fight, makes the story-line truly interesting.The animation and sounds are also on the level. Not only character designs, but also the food makes you want to cook something delicious. The creators of Food Wars! spend enough time and money on the animation, making cooking look more like a fistfight than anything else. The sounds and the voice acting; however, deserve a special mention. The OST is so awesome that it helps you to dive into the atmosphere of this series and to be more prepared for what is about to happen. Truth be told, I have never called a shounen “epic”, but thanks to the OST of Food Wars! I can say that this anime is truly epic sometimes. But the OST is not the only thing that I should mention, the voice acting is also amazing: all characters seem to be real, their emotions, their deeds; the Japanese cast did one hell of a job voicing their characters.I cannot say that the characters of Food Wars! are absolutely flawless and I cannot say that Souma, the main protagonist of the series, is just an imitation of his ancestors from other shounen series. Souma is not perfect, sometimes you just do not want him to repeat all these cliché of his ancestors. (Not noticing that some girls love him, for example). But, at the same time, Souma is different because he is the true warrior, he is the true man. His aim to become the top, his aim to become the best. His is not a prodigy, he is not a billionaire, he is just a normal young man with his own dreams. Sometimes he is defeated, sometimes he does not know what to do, but he works hard and achieves what he wants. And I must say that his charisma is truly contagious. However, the main problem of this anime is supporting characters. They are so dull and boring that sometimes you just want to skip their scenes. Of course, I am not going to say that they all are bad, some of them are very interesting to follow. But I guess that more attention should have been spent on the supporting characters. I am glad that I discovered Food Wars! I could have never imagined that Souma would be that good. There will surely be some moments, when you are unsure if you should watch it, or not. Take for example “these foodgasms.” But, come on, it should not be the reason for you to not watch this series. In my opinion, the way they portrayed the way characters enjoy food is not that bad. I mean, delicious food is able to drive you to orgasm and if you do not agree with me, I am sorry to say that, but you have never tasted something truly delicious. All in all, Food Wars! is an anime I would surely recommend to all my friends and if I were you, I would do the same. Souma’s desire to become the best and his character are truly fascinating. He is not afraid to practice, he is not afraid to be wrong, he spends a ton of time to surprise everyone. And he is able to amaze not only his friends and enemies, but also the viewer. Anyways, to make long story short, I would recommend you to give this anime a try. But please, if you want to drop this series, watch what will happen in the summer camp; it will become much more interesting from this point. But if it is still not enough for you, you can drop this anime after Souma’s summer camp.Anyways, I hope that you will enjoy Food Wars!",5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"Everytime I watch this at night, it's a must to get a snack or some food first (though my food is nothing compared to the stuff in food wars). It's very exhilarating whenever there is a shokugeki/food battle going on (involving Soma most of the time) and there IS romance in this, just not as much as regular romance anime since it mainly focuses on cooking. this also has a 80% chance to motivate you to cook but then 90% of the people that get motivated realize they can't (i'm one of those people).",5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"If you were to assess this anime purely objectively, you'd more than likely conclude that its bizarre, has a paper thin plot and is completely over the top. However, adding a layer of context to something seemingly mundane is something Anime does extraordinarily well. For instance, in one episode, someone draws parallel between two dishes presented on the show, one is described as an exquisite jewelry box, something that is meticulously organised and is incredibly beautiful, another dish in comparison is described as a treasure box you once hunted down as a child, it was thus only limited by your imagination. An exceptional show, it will hold a place in my memory for a long long time.",5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"Yup, binge watched this one simply because I couldn't stop watching. The competitive spirit of the culinary world is demonstrated to the extreme here.

food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"I fell in love with 'Food Wars!' immediately. It has everything I adore all wrapped up in a well made package. I watch a lot of Chopped, Master Chef, Cutthroat Kitchen, and the like, so the premise stood out to me right away. The recipes are smart and the animation makes the food look irresistible. Each chef has their own unique flair and the characters are all so well done, I fell in love with them all.I also have a soft spot for the trope of a high school built around a tournament-style competition; shows like 'The Irregular at Magic High School' and 'Chivalry of a Failed Knight' are my guilty pleasures. And to top it all off, this show is  hysterical. It cranks the drama up to 11 and plays it with a straight face perfectly, never acknowledging the fact that its doing so. The result is one of my favorite anime of the last few years and I can't wait to devour more.PS: I love that the show never had any aspect of a harem, even though it could have easily done so. Soma loves food and food alone, and it shows.",5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"This is a show about cooking and cooking-inspired orgasms, so if you like food and orgasms and foodgasms, you will like this show. So what else is missing? What else could you possibly want? Motivation. Yes, there are sorts of reasons for why things happen and why characters are the way they are and why we should care about anything, but they're not terribly convincing. If you read the manga, things actually start to make less and less sense rather than making more sense. Still, the food-porn is pretty great, and the ecchi orgasms are fun, so it's a solid show, just not quite great.",5

Studio Bandai Namco Pictures (Gintama) is handling the animation pretty well, with great music and direction.",5

Even though it is light heated, it has that magic where you come to care about the characters...

welcome-to-demon-school-iruma-kun,"This show is still in it's infancy this season as of writing this review, but I have been a big fan of the manga for quite a while, so I can base my review somewhat off of that.Here is the breakdown of what to expect from this show (spoiler free):Marimashita! Iruma-kun or the english title they went with,  Welcome to Demon School! Iruma-kun is a lighthearted comedy series set in an academy with some minor romance and action elements. It features a cast of very fun and unique characters that subvert various tropes in the genre and contribute to the charming tone of the series. All the points of conflict in the series will likely not get you on the edge of your seat, at least not initially, but they are still amusing to watch. Overall you should not expect a deeply profound or particularly heavy story going into this series. In terms of Production Quality, they have so far done a great job as well. I have no complaints with the character designs or animations, and the voice acting holds up as well. So, if you are interested in this type of show and do not expect any life-changing experience, I have a feeling you will enjoy it.",5
welcome-to-demon-school-iruma-kun,This is one of the best manga's and anime shows I've actually watched! It's got a good story-line to it. And it gets a bit weird for my taste. Which is perfect while settling down after a long hard days work and wanting to watch some anime before I go to sleep. My girlfriend is also into this type of genre of shows as well and when I'm well in front of her in the episodes. Well... Let's just say I've seen it and she gets mad at me.,5
welcome-to-demon-school-iruma-kun,"Now, I'm not some anime connoisseur, or some sort of elitist aficionado when it comes to the shows I watch (because I watch and enjoy plenty of horribly written and just straight up bad anime).However, I am here to tell you Iruma-kin is neither of those things! In fact, Iruma-kun is quite good! While I don't think it is the most groundbreaking or revolutionary anime of our time (I'd give that honor solely to Steins;Gate only on the grounds that it has made my  mother of all people a die hard anime fan), it succeeds in what it sets out to do: be a fun, wholesome romp about characters misunderstanding the intentions of our protagonist, Iruma-kun, and somehow their lives end up much more positive as a result of these increasingly absurd misunderstandings. Iruma's innate kind nature and inability to refuse people's requests are the core of the show. They drive the show forward, and are also the predominant joke making machines.The show is extremely proficient in setting up your expectations, and doing one of two things:1. A joke, or the set up for a joke, will foreshadow and allude to its own payoff before the punchline even lands, and despite knowing exactly where the joke is going to go, it pays off in a satisfying manner because the absurdity ends up going even farther then you predicted. Iruma meeting Ameri for the first time is a prime example.2. Following the last technique, the show will do a subversion of your expectations, and surprise you with the joke. While not as common as the first technique, it does happen, and the reason it's so effective is because the show is playing with your expectations of how it usually sets up a joke.The show will also continually make call backs to established character quirks, traits and jokes involving them, but using new situations and scenarios to test those quirks and see how they respond. A particular favorite running gag of mine is Iruma's inability to refuse someone's request no matter how mundane, big or small. Needless to say, this puts him into some really crazy situations which only increase people's conflated perception of him as this hyper bad-ass demon mad lad, creating a feedback loop that Iruma can't seem to escape from.I think Iruma-kun is an excellent show. Not groundbreaking or revolutionary, but tried, tested, and true. It's a show that works, with a wonderful heartwarming cast of characters that all play off of Iruma's personality really well. It's hard not to like any of the characters, and despite all of the characters being demons, many of them are more wholesome and human than most of humanity!",5
welcome-to-demon-school-iruma-kun,"I did not expect an anime with a title like this to be this good. I fell in love with the world even though it's the netherworld. It's an anime designed for kids, but it's still a very fun to watch seriesNow that I sometimes am around kids from other parents, I'm nervous about them seeing many animes out there. This would be a series I wouldn't mind them seeing. It's a very clean anime. It doesn't have to go to heavy fanservice to get noticed (at least up until episode 13)I especially like that Iruma seems to have some balance to him.",5
welcome-to-demon-school-iruma-kun,Iruma a poor down-trodden human boy gets sold to a demon by his so-called parents and so our adventure in demon school begins with our hero who keeps trying to not stand out but of course does anyway. I'm really enjoying this high school comedy with a twist the characters are interesting and their have been a few differences from other high school animes inserted into the usual series like this besides being a demon school. I've noted the lack of fan service theirs plenty of magical powers and little violence you could watch this with older kids. I'm giving a low 5 here and a 8.5 on a 10 scale I'd certainly recommend it. I've noticed that this is getting a English dub I thought I'd be watching this again sometime in the future so i'll wait for the dub to finish then watch again in English.,5
welcome-to-demon-school-iruma-kun,"Sounded in the description like a dull pile of rehashed genres - Kyo Kara Maoh + rise of ""ordinary high school boy"" to king of the pirates/yokai/ninjas/demons/etc. + every high school slice-of-life ever. I was bored, so I finally checked it out. Comedy gold! Fundamental premise: this kid has spent his life as a doormat, working his butt off and dodging misfortune. It's given him Super Doormat Powers, and puts him in hilarious situations because he just can't say ""no."" If you doubt that you'll like this, it's actually well worth a view. I'm at episode 10, and so far the plot is ticking along nicely. At first the narrator seems repetitive, but gradually the repetition becomes more and more hilarious, so give it a chance.",5
welcome-to-demon-school-iruma-kun,"This show is significantly better than you would expect. The jokes all land solidly (even the ones that aren't your cup of tea). The characters are all extremely distinct and memorable.At first it feels like its a kids show, but it really does just land for everybody. It gives you that pure feeling while still being incredible for adults to watch. I love all of these sweetheart demons(and boy).",5
welcome-to-demon-school-iruma-kun,"I'm writing this after 9 episodes. The first few episodes were good and now it's just great. They could've just kept him OP and let thing's go stale after a while, but I love how the MC decides that he really wants to climb the ranks using his own power instead of power given to him.It makes me really respect his character development and the show a lot more now, and I already loved the show before. Other than that the show does a really good job so far at introducing and developing characters and gives them enough of their own time to flesh them out a bit more. Clara for example who most of the time is shown cheerful and ridiculously air headed is shown twice to actually have more depth. The epsiode where she is introduced she actually understands her situation more than it seems, and in episode 8 where she has a whole episode dedicated to her showing that she has feelings, wants, a family etc. really developing her character from the funny but sometimes nearly annoying shtick to something heartwarming that you would be glad to have around.",5
welcome-to-demon-school-iruma-kun,"I know, corny review title, but seriously it's the best. The art style is great, the story is hilarious, and the characters are fantastic! The series so far is basically just Iruma not trying to make himself noticed or on one occasion purposefully screw up and it just never works. It is hilarious and I almost want it to take on some more serious plotlines in the future with its same style of humor and charm.",5
welcome-to-demon-school-iruma-kun,"When I first saw this on Crunchyroll I thought that this show wouldn't be any good. I was wrong. I decided to check this out, despite my initial reluctance one Saturday and my god was this show funny! A Human teenager goes to the Demon World and somehow benefits! This show is total comedy, but the intro does seem to allude to possible future action/battles. To me this show is like a hybrid of Rosario Vampire and My Hero Academia. Both shows are great, so this is a good thing! The characters are all crazy and that makes the show! Can't wait til episode 8. Also I'm surprised that this does not have a Dub!",5
welcome-to-demon-school-iruma-kun,"The show is only on episode 6 right now, but I absolutely love it so much!Every episode is another episode of fun! Every episode so far has brought me so much joy. I can not help but laugh out loud each and every time! I highly recommend anyone interested in comedy, demon v humans, school life, magic, or friendship building anime to give this a shot! You will not be disappointed!From the preview I figured it would be a little comedic, but I was definitely not expecting it to be this amazing! The show is so incredibly adorable! But I definitely rate it 5/5 stars!",4
welcome-to-demon-school-iruma-kun,"It isn't just another Isekai or just comedy, once I start watching Welcome to Demon School! Imura-kun, I won't be bored for a single second, things happening are unexpected and fun, despite all that happening it still manages to keep serious feel to it. I find main character and companions very fun to follow and all the characters are colorful with special traits each of their own.Not too good writing reviews but the point is you should give it a go even if it seems different from usual stuff you watch, you may very well like it.",5
welcome-to-demon-school-iruma-kun,"This has to be one of my new favorites of this year. It is a fun anime revolving around Iruma, a human boy who gets taken in as the Grandson of a powerful demon named Sullivan. Thus he starts his life at demon school. Going into this anime I cannot say I anticipated much. However I was pleasantly surprised when I found a fun, light hearted show with a lovable cast of characters! I cannot wait for each week when the new episode comes out. If you are looking for something fun and enjoyable to watch, I highly recommend Welcome to Demon School! Iruma-kun",5
welcome-to-demon-school-iruma-kun,"i was a little worried when i heard they were making an anime adaptation of this series, and after watching the first several episodes i can say i am not disappointed with it. the animation feels like a throwback in the best possible way, after being let down by atrocious CGI animated series in 2019 (im looking at you ascendancy of a bookworm) the late 90's early 2000's style of animation feels nostalgic and pleasant to look at. there's a shocking lack of ecchi fan-service BS and Iruma just seems like an all around good dude. i love his grandpa and the reactions from iruma's teacher when he's forced to use the cute teaching aids given to him. can't wait for this series to continue!",5
welcome-to-demon-school-iruma-kun,"I didn't have high expectations! But even though this is not a complicated storyline with lot of predictability, there's one place where you are pretty stunned: It's pretty freaking funny! There's so many moments where you didn't see that joke coming.The superpower of our main protagonist Iruma is a absolute pushover and that aspect makes the whole story filled with golden comedy for people of all ages. It's a must watch, low intensity, highly funny and wholesome.",5
welcome-to-demon-school-iruma-kun,"So far, i looked at this anime and though, how could this ever be good? This is going to be another soft hentai anime... So far i am completely wrong. It is HILARIOUS. I'm enjoying it so much so far, i want more of it. 5/5 for me right now. Yes it is a little overdone in some occasions, but i do think it helps capture the ""humor"" they tried to implement. Overall I love it. Tend to repeat a lot but it's the beginning so I understand for now 5/5 still imo hopefully it gets even better!!!",5
welcome-to-demon-school-iruma-kun,"This anime is great fun, and hands down in my top #1 anime for this season, considering this anime actually makes me laugh is already a great start, every thing feels natural and well paced between each episode, with the high school vibes going on, and Iruma disrupting the natural balance of the demon world giving that he's a human and all, so it also puts a risk to his life while trying to blend in as a demon, I mean I'm sure nothing terrible is going to happen giving this seems like a pretty friendly anime so far, but anyways, this anime is a lot of fun to watch and really entertaining, that school chant caught me off guard at the beginning.",5
welcome-to-demon-school-iruma-kun,"I saw a clip of the show on YouTube and I was curious, so I clicked it. I wasn't expecting to be genuinely interested in the show, but here I am. I watched the first two episodes yesterday and caught up on the available translated chapters, I absolutely adore this series.I'm genuinely excited to see how far this adaptation will go and I'm hoping it'll get a second season after season one finishes.",5
welcome-to-demon-school-iruma-kun,Okay so I watched the first two episodes and here is what I can say.This is a must-watch!This is the best comedy of the season and it is definitely a fresh approach to its genre. The main character is a cute cinnamon roll and the anime uses this in contrast with the other main characters to create episodes packed full of really funny gags and developments. It looks like there is an overarching plot which means it isn't just a plain comedy anime and I am really excited to see where this goes. Also just a side note but this really fits Halloween that is coming up later this month and I am living for it!,5
welcome-to-demon-school-iruma-kun,"Its just a blast to watch! Every episode so far has just left me wanting more ... All the characters are really enjoyable/comical (like how can you dis-like that in an anime). I bet (FOR A FACT) that you'll always watch this show with a smile on your face. Then again its funny that i'm telling you what ""my opinion"" is when everyone has their ""own opinion"". I say give it a shot! If you don't end up enjoying it ... then you don't have to watch it haha.",5
welcome-to-demon-school-iruma-kun,"At first I thought this was going to be just like a certain other anime story about a human boy finding himself in a demon school surrounded by a harem of cute demon girls.  But boy was I wrong.  So far the harem is made of guys. I don't know if this is a good thing or a bad thing, but we are two episodes in, so I'm just gonna roll with it... I'm gonna crunchyroll with it.  But yeah, it's a good anime.  Watch it.",5
welcome-to-demon-school-iruma-kun,"Welcome to Demon School isn't a bad show, its an un-aggressive shonen high school generic isakai with charming but very two dimensional characters with 'hints' of a third dimension. The biggest problem with demon school is it plays a little ""too safe"" much of its been done, its been done better, maybe not all the elements have been together in one show before but its pretty easy to cherry pick aspects that are done much better in a High School Anime, Isakai, or Shonen. But its a nice un-agressive blend of the tropes that has an abundance of charm and humor with decent enough writing to get its humor across. Not groundbreaking but very enjoyable in a season saturated in Isakaitus",5
welcome-to-demon-school-iruma-kun,"About the best thing I can say about this title is that I did make it through the season. But I've found little to recommend it. The narrative and characters are weak, but not horrible. The voice acting is so-so, with some characters OK, but one in particular is highly annoying. Direction leaves a lot to be desired. The artwork, and especially the animation, are Saturday Morning cartoonish, much below average for a Japanese production. It's just not much of an effort, and strikes me as a hastily slapped together mess, about on par with Pokemon or Yugio. I might rate this about 1 1/2 stars fairly. But I will give it credit for having enough potential in the cosmos created, that I kept watching, expecting something really interesting to happen. Even though I was disappointed, the fact I was not beaten down into giving up, allows me to round up to 2 stars.",5
welcome-to-demon-school-iruma-kun,"This is an isekai anime for sure, and I was about to pass up on this, but decided to give it a try just for the sake of it. While it definitely can't get the 5-star rating, it does have interesting premise and the ""overpower"" condition of the MC is ""reasonable""Quite funny, and based on the first 2 episodes, seems quite interesting and might have redeeming quality despite being an isekai anime.That said, unless the character has good development or it adds the comedy element, it will just stay average. Depending on people, average is relative. I saw some people said that ""Isekai Cheat Magician"" is average, for me, that anime is trash. it's a 0-star anime. Average is 3-star, and thus the rating right now.I hope it can get to a 4* by turning more of a comedy isekai (like ""hattage kemono michi"") rather than going into overpowered but stupid isekai.",5
welcome-to-demon-school-iruma-kun,"Shounen.If you're looking for a shounen to watch about a pretty much tame, almost wimpy boy, who doesn't really seem interested in becoming more than what he is?Well this is an anime for you.  Obviously the MC eventually starts to change, but the initial impression of the MC can be a bit lackluster.However it is a very Shounen story that is very Shounen in nature and very Shounen in orientation.  If you don't like shounen don't even touch this, but if you absolutely love shounen you're going to need to watch this.",5
fire-force,"So, you haven’t watched Fire Force yet? Well then, lemme ask you....did you watch/read Soul Eater? Sure, the ending isn’t all that great for it, but the manga author had a better ending intended. Anyways, the creator of Soul Eater has been cooking up a new series for a few years now, and it’s pretty great. Now, let me ask you a different question....do you watch/read JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure? Sure, this show has nothing to do with Fire Force, but if you like JoJos for the animation quality, then I have good news for you. David Production, the animation studio for JoJos, picked up this series for an anime adaptation, and let’s just say....they brought the heat (pun absolutely intended). So with all of this being said, if you liked Soul Eater, or if you like action anime with great animation and amazing fight scenes (or if you’re just a pyromaniac) then you should definitely start watching Fire Force!",4
fire-force,"This review will be a bit lengthy but I have a lot to say I have been reading the Fire Force Manga since it released not too long ago and honestly I am very happy with the approach they took from what I have seen in the first episode(Only episode 1 is out at the time of this review). There are few minor changes the anime had from the manga but it you cant include every little detail from the Manga, I was happy that even though they made the changes to try to fit the 24 minute mark they still included context about them (I,E having a quote be said in the Manga but just put in another scene to save time). The episode felt a tiny bit rushed but not anywhere close to bad (Looking at you Index III) I felt like some scenes from the Manga could have been included instead of the pan shots of the cathedral but obviously they wanted to use their resources for other scenes. Speaking of other scenes the fight scenes are FIRE pun intended. I expected as much from David Productions and they sure delivered. Imagine Soul Eater style fighting with modern animation from a studio well known for fight scenes. I was blown away from how smooth they animated it and trust me its not easy trying to animate a flashy fight going a million miles an hour with fire all around while still keeping crisp animation in every frame. 10/10Lastly the CV's they chose for each character is perfect. When reading the Manga the voices I gave the characters in my head are basically the same as the CV's. Gakuto Kajiwara on Shinra was perfect honestly and sometimes you can hear a little Asta in his dialog but its not the exact same (which is a plus). M.A.O on Iris is the best choice honestly I have loved M.A.O's work as Kyoko Takanashi from World Break, Enri Emmot from Overlord, Renren Tomaru from The Failed Knight (Which was awesome giving her a hyper character to change it up!) I could go on forever about M.A.O but she was honestly one of the best parts about this show (I am also very Iris bias so this is a dream come true) The other CV's for each character are also amazing I especially can't wait for Yūsuke Kobayashi as Arthur (Subaru as Arthur!!!!) The Opening song Inferno by Mrs Green Apple is a super nice touch! Super catchy the more you listen to it. In my top 10 OPs of the season for sure I enjoy it more than Dr.Stone's OP tbh.And lastly the ED... I loved it.l... Main reason: Iris. That is all and if you where able to read this review to the end and you actually took the time for this review I thank you. You are a true person of culture!",5
fire-force,"This show introduces the characters quickly, but good character writing and design makes them all stand out immediately. The premise - a world faced with both tragedy and mystery - is interesting as well. There's a lot going on here, and it's all been done pretty well.The structure of the world branches out almost immediately, and there's some great action sequences. So far this one is a winner and is well worth a watch.",5
fire-force,Are you ready to fight fire with fire?  Do you expect to use water and other normal methods of firefighting? TOO BAD!  Now you can fight fire by kicking a fire demon in the face with a fire kick why does this work?  BECAUSE SCIENCE!! so bring your Charizards and your flamethrowers friends time to save the day and kick some fire demons in the teeth! P.S like fire nuns man.  P.S.S this would actually be ludicrously effective.,5
fire-force,"My favorite creditor of Soul Eater is back with an awesome Anime called Fire Force. I loved Shinra so much. He got Bagkuo Fight style but Izuku's ambition to be a hero. This anime has an amazing opening and has a shot for season two. The Best anime every. I would love to read the manga too. You will have a blast watching this anime with its soul eater vibe. I can't wait to cosplay Shinra over summer comic con. My Rps Izuku is like Shinra, He uses dragon slayer magic like from Fairy Tail to fight and get around places. I hope these anime get an award for the best anime, I love this anime so much if take Bagkuo Quirk then Izuku using hand and legs to fight then add a little soul into the mix you gwt Shrinra,  So pumped for Sho Vs Shrnia.",5
fire-force,Story starts slow and only the great animation kept me in. But when figures start showing themselves and more ties are being drawn you start to see the depth of the characters and the noise. Some people complain about the fan service but honestly its nothing that impedes upon the action of story. Its even less of an issue than the fan service from Food Wars!. Anyway the story gets quite interesting when other units make an appearance and you are left to wonder exactly who is good and bad. Stick with it. You wont regret it.,5
fire-force,First thing I want to say is that I like this show. I think it could get better. But at around the half way point of the series it seems to start dragging. It feels like nothing ever is being achieved by the main team. Who new that the show about fire would burn me out the fastest.Edit: so as of episode 21 it has gotten a lot better. Stuff is actually happening again. So my rating is going from a 3 star to a four star.,5
fire-force,"It is an anime I wish I could binge watch because of course there is a cliffhanger each time. The premise is pretty interesting and I love the animation! The Fire Force has a lot of different parts so there are times when I wish they could delve into subjects more but I will need to continue to watching to see if they'll go into it. I'm not personally a huge fan of fan service, but it isn't super overbearing. Will update later on in the season.",5
fire-force,"I don't think i am the target audience for this anime anyways, but I wanted to like this anime, and there was a lot of hype surrounding it when it came out. However, after finishing the first 12 episodes and heading into the fall season i found myself with no desire to continue the story. I think if i was in high school or junior high or something i would enjoy it, but I'm tired of the same old Japanese humor such as the girl that always finds a way to lose her clothing. She is embarrassed and the guys are pervert act. The characters are cliche and probably more relatable for someone going through adolescence.",5
fire-force,"I can't say that I dislike Fire Force because I keep coming back every week for the new episodes, though that might just be because of the opening. I say this because from the very start this anime hasn't been very good about giving the viewers a good background or even a good grasp at all of what's going on. They are quick to add plot elements that are never explained and seem to dote on the less important parts of the plots and jump around instead of focusing on the main idea. That said, the story in of its self has great potential and is quite unique. The art style and the action scenes are very well done and make the show exciting to watch even with the lack of story structure. I still hold out hope as the newest episodes have been seemingly more plot motivated, and I'm excited to see what transpires in the next few episode of this series!",5
fire-force,"I always wait to review a series until I've finished every episode, but this series has been different and I feel warrants an early rating. The animation style and sound are utterly perfect in every way; it's incredible the depth of feeling and emotion they're able to convey in the fights each episode. The storyline and premise of the series is quite unique as well and I'm excited to see where the series goes and how it will progress toward the MC and the 8th fighting against the Evangelist and his crew. Honestly, the only slight downside is how the lucky-perv trope feels forced in multiple instances, but I'm no so stuck-up that I'd hold that against the rest of the series; it's not actually THAT bad, but sometimes it just feels like they're pandering to 12 year-olds a bit strongly... SERIOUSLY, everything else about the series is fantastic and I've loved every episode thus far. I'm looking forward to the rest and I know I'll enjoy the ride!",5
fire-force,"While this show feels promising, I've consistently been disappointed with it's story, characters, and creative choices. You may find you're happy to overlook it's flaws, or may just turn it off after an episode or two, sick of the little things they consistently get wrong.On a positive note, the animation is superb, and the overall theme and world is interesting. This show has a solid premise, and feels like it could go places.On a negative note, the characters feel weak, and their behavior frequently feels unjustified or unusual, especially the villains. The ""fanservice"" is a nuisance that feels gratuitous and obnoxious rather than enjoyable. I'm not religious, but the anime-inspired supernatural Christianity comes off a little tone-deaf, rather than being something sincere that brings depth to the setting.",4
fire-force,"Now in order to review as a fan, you don't go with just facts, most of it will be biased. That's what fans do, they ignore facts and go on with their personal opinions. If someone called you trash simply because they didn't like you, that's an opinion and they have their own reasons. So here I go. I'm giving this 5 stars because, well, I really like it. I'm sure someone out there will find the flaws, but to me this is really personal. I often find my life dragged by societies way of being stupid. Whether it be calling the air conditioning to believing the Earth is flat I find them very stupid, and I find myself looking for something, or someone to change that. How I see this anime is that it focuses UN-corrupting the world by becoming hero's. And also finding a way to serve true justice. I see this anime as the examples of what people today should see as a fitting example of a human. People who only want to do the world a better place.",4
fire-force,"Firstly, Soul-Eater style animations, boosted by the crispiness and intensity of 2019/2020 design improvements - huge, in every regard. Every scene is just amazing to look at. More importantly, the story, miles of room for any necessary character development complemented by interesting characters. Every side-character lore is, if not necessary, at least interesting, which is hard to achieve. Whether you watch the show weekly or all in one sitting, it is definitely one of the best current running seasonals ❀❤︎",4
fire-force,"This show so far has been a great trip, and I can't wait to keep watching!  So far this show has shown really good animation, art, music, and story (Especially such a unique story at that). The whole show feels pretty fresh, my ONE and only issue is that they censored the outro after the first three (Don't quote me) episodes which definitely doesn't seem necessary. This show is a definite watch and you're missing out if you aren't watching.",5
fire-force,"Starting off summer this anime is definitely in the top 2 only comparable to doctor stone,Art:  the colors and the animation  is so well done.  David productions really went all out. when making Fire force, Everything starting from episode 1 is just colored so bright and vibrant it,  from the colors of the fires, to the colors and shapes of each characters eyes when they get serious.. you can really just appreciate how much time and effort was put into it each scene. Leaving you to want more after each episodeStory: is 10/10 in my opinion . After watching episode 1 I was instantly hooked. To the point where I had to read the manga which I finished in 2 days LOL.  It's about a boy who always wanted to become a hero, however one day he suffered a accident that made him lose everything. and now growing up he decided to still hold on to his dream but while becoming a hero he realizes he will need to uncovered the secrets in society. From reading the manga and comparing the animation it's paced really well!Characters: ALL ARE GREAT LUL.Shinra,Arthur, Iris and Tamaki are the best!",2
fire-force,"Ten/Ten this is probably my favorite show this season. It's an awesome slice of Shonen action, with amazing animation, fight scenes, AND as the great Gigguk often says: ""The opener is a ******* banger!!"" A steampunk futuristic post apocalyptic world where people spontaneously combust...well, that certainly raises the stakes a bit. And the waifus, dear friends, oh the high quality waifus. Get ready for twenty four episodes of this awesomeness, because Fire Force is...dare I say, LIT.",4
fire-force,"the first 2 episodes were pretty good, animation good, fighting good, characters good, but that is all in my opinion. after the 3rd and 4rth episodes, i really started getting into it,  there was a plot and a lot of unanswered questions that they were trying to uncover, 4rth episode was kinda weird, but also really good, one thing i really like about this is their expressions, and personality's, it's so different then anything else, i don't know how to explain it but it's amazing. One last thing is the cut scenes, like the expressions, i don't know how to explain it, but it's so smooth.",3
fire-force,"please watch this show. from the two episodes out right now, this show is definetly amazing. in the first episode we get action packed scenes and we meet awesome characters, we get a cool and mysteryious plot, a sad backstory and more. and in the second episode we got a new member of the team arthur and i love him. we also got a sad and emotional mission where they have to take out a infernal that is pretty much asking for death and it made me really sad",5
fire-force,"Seeing that there are only 125 reviews of this show, I felt the need to say my piece. Some of those reviews seem to be by people who didn't actually watch the show.  If you're reading this, ignore those others.  They don't know what they are tallking about.  How about the people who liked the show giving it a review?  Here's my (very short, no spoilers) review:This show is awesome.  I was hesitant at first, I mean really; spontaneous combustion? But now it's the end of the season and it has become one of my favorite shows.  Oh, and the soundtrack is great, the art is superb and the story is well worth watching.  So watch it already!",2
fire-force,"The first few episodes were sorta slow paced but if you stick with this anime i promise you'll learn to love this series. Fire force became one of my favorite anime in only 3 short months. Animation is top tier, characters are really cool and likable in addition the theme of the anime is really well made. The fan service does get a little annoying but i think the incredible fight scenes and music easily make up for it. The characters actually have unique but quirky personalities and i think if you're looking for a good anime to binge watch look no further. Plus it's only 24 episodes so it's perfect length. Happy holidays!",5
fire-force,"In a world shaped by mighty flame, Spontaneous Human Combustion exists. Humanity has been plagued by this phenomenon for over a century. Sudden death by flame, followed by a rampaging infernal corpse demon left to terrorize any in their wake. Tokyo's Armed Forces, Fire Defense Agency, and Holy Church of Sol needed a solution, as which lead to the creation of the Special Fire Force. A collection of soldiers and pyrokinetics gathered to combat the oncoming fires. Shinra Kusakabe is one of the rookies gathered from the latest generation of firefighters. A young lad who nicknamed the Devil's Footprint for his abilities to generate fire from his feet. He joins the force to be a hero, and search for the infernal that claimed his mother and younger brother twelve years ago. His battles in the force will soon reveal that the fire's smoke has some mirrors, mirrors to be shattered and reveal the hideous truth behind their world of flames.Fire Force is the latest Shounen to take the anime world by storm, or, at least it had the potential to be. The hype for this anime is real, it showed such early promise from its praised animation, to its steady pacing, and of course its stylistic usage of fire. So what went wrong? This anime was shaping up to be real anime of the year material, but for me and many other people it just kind of lost our attention. Was it a weakness in the writing? Too many slideshows in the animation to save budget in between the fight scenes? Typical Shounen fight scene problems? Did other anime such as Demon Slayer's second half steal away its explosive premier? To answer all those questions, yes, but also no.In truth the problems I personally see in Fire Force as a whole are just few, however their repetition is the real issue. First off I have to talk about the animation, because it really isn't as good as it was made out to be. Yes, early on there are plenty of scenes to be hyped about, to watch repeatedly cause they are so damn good. However as the show went on, the lack of physical movement within its many non-combat scenes was difficult to ignore. I don't care about fantastic animation anyways as an anime fan, yes it's great to see, but seeing how most anime originates through manga popularity, I think we all can live without Fate budget level fights as long as everything else can hold our attention to the screen. To put it simply, if you were to watch this anime dubbed, 90% of the time you wouldn't miss anything if you didn't pause the anime to read a text on your phone. Especially when the anime slowly started to forget that it had a whole cast of characters to work with. A lot of Fire Force's charm was thanks to the dynamics between Company 8's members, sadly in typical Shounen fashion, Shinra takes center stage halfway in and didn't feel like sharing. Don't even get me started on how Tamaki is handled, or lack thereof. Or how Iris is basically forgotten about completely for the second half. All while Shinra himself, I'm gonna be honest, I don't like him. He's incredibly stubborn, and it's played up in fights for way too long to the point of banality. Also based on the few times he and Tamaki interact, I wouldn't be surprised if he's sexist. (Keyword being wouldn't be surprised, I'm not directly calling him sexist.) Not to mention despite his faults or naivety at times, he never gets in any real danger. Or it's the complete opposite where he is in all of the thinkable danger imaginable, and still gets out with little to no long term effects. Kind of the equivalent of say like Deku from My Hero Academia not having scars on his hands to remind him not to act recklessly. With the way Fire Force is structured as a whole, I'd argue nobody really grows or learns from the events that happen. It really feels like this anime is trying to be hype for the sake of trying to be hype, a lot of things don't really make sense, but are not played up for laughs either. Which ended up creating this weird middle ground where nothing really happens, and with that aforementioned lack of animation across during a majority of the anime, it really needed to play up more laughs with the cast as a whole.So after everything I just said, is Fire Force worth your time? That's a big maybe, in my opinion it is good fodder to turn your brain off, but is too stagnant outside of its fights to keep your attention as the plot moves forward. Fire Force isn't over yet, it is set to pick back up for a season two in the summer of 2020. It might hit the ground running now that the groundwork is set, or it will continue to dwindle it's own flame before being blown out by the many other highly anticipated anime coming next year. Only time will tell how the Fire Force's flame will act.",5
fire-force,"Fire force has a very special place in my heart ❤️!!! Pros: The series has HOLY TEIR animation, The comedy is good when you think about how ridiculous it is, The storytelling and world building makes me think of so many different things and this series dominates creativity because not many other series have been as interesting and creative as this one! Fire force isn’t always crazy but it actually takes time to build plot which a lot of series tend to skip when actually making episodes which leaves plot holes but this series sticks to a good script with some weird pacing here and there but it still looks great! Overall I literally love this anime and like other anime I feel like it deserves a complete adaptation to be remembered in the books as the coolest anime about fire fighters (Also this show puts respect on firefighters because they truly risk their lives everyday protecting us and I greatly appreciated them!!!) Cons: As of 2019 December 5th, There is a lot of hate for fire force and people are saying wrong about it just because of small trivial things like one character or a bad op or even not wanting to watch past 10 episodes.... This is a con because people are listening to other reviews rather than turning to look to the series itself and determine wether they want to watch it!! THIS GOES FOR ALL ANIME: if the series has more than 5 episodes... And your still watching it.... MAKE SURE YOU KNOW WHEN YOU WANNA STOP BECAUSE 5 episodes for me isn’t even a preview for what’s to come with most shonen... to be honest I wish every anime could get a complete adaptation but that’s a lot of money.... but this series Fire force, needs a complete Adaptation because while there is hate.... WE ARE STILL HERE!! THE PEOPLE WHO LOVE THIS SERIES ARE STILL HERE AND WE WILL WAIT FOR AN ERA TO SEE THE END OF SPONTANEOUS HUMAN COMBUSTION LATOM!",5
fire-force,"Fire Force is...watchable.  The structure and pacing of the show hit some familiar story beats you'll find in other anime, most notably BLEACH.  In fact, if you like BLEACH, you will most likely enjoy this anime too (although it is definitely not as good as BLEACH)Animation:  5 out of 5The animation is superb.  I really have no complaints here.  This is likely where the majority of the budget went.Story:  3 out of 5It is very tropey, and unless something drastically changes to turn the series on its head, it appears to be a simple ""religious zealot needs to be defeated"" storyline.  Characters:  2 out of 5If the storyline is tropey, the characters are *extremely* tropey, and I feel like this is the biggest let down in the show.  With one notable exception, characters seem to do exactly what you anticipate that they would do in the singular dimension that they occupy.Music:  3 out of 5It never was noticeably good or bad in the show itself, though the season 1 OP was definitely a standout.  Worldbuilding:  3.5 out of 5The show makes a passable attempt at a believable society, and honestly, the premise of the show is interesting (what is society like when any person can turn into a rampaging monster at literally any moment)?  Sadly, the show does not spend the time needed to develop its own world (so far anyway).",4
fire-force,"I'm genuinely surprised at the bad or lackluster reviews that this show has received. So much so I had to write my first review on it. I'm unsure where to even begin.It has an idea that is just classic Anime, random world happening gives people powers. Boy wants to become hero, etc etc. What surprises me is the show's ability to make me re-watch scenes over and over again. The art alone is enough to make me watch, the cinematography is something I find to be incredible. There are things that happen in the story where I just don't understand why it was included yet random little details like that just make me so happy. They're creepy even, the position of characters or the camera angles. The contrast of the dark storyline and happenings to the weird and upbeat dialogue expressed by the main characters. The fact that they don't just explain everything straight up like most anime will. I'm still learning about the world and whats happened to it 15 episodes in, that is good storytelling in my book. Aside from this, all of the characters are so likable, like a little family that I'm watching interact with one another at the 8th. I can see the issues people see in the story, the fan service can come off as forced and they do accentuate character personalities, but it's nothing that is show-ruining.For being something so ""cliche,"" Fire Force simply strikes me as unorthodox and enjoyable. So many things in this anime is just so delightfully random. I know this review was a bit of a mess, but hopefully it'll convince someone to bypass the bad reviews and give it a chance. Cheers.",4
fire-force,"Look, when I first learned about this show I was mega hyped. The character designs were really freaking cool, the production was top notch, and the whole base concept and design of these kickass fire fighters who fight fire with FREAKING FIRE! It was just straight up - HELL YEAH!However... After a full 13 episodes I must say, not only did it not live up to the hype, it just isn't that great in general. What this show has going for it is all the outside stuff like the stuff I mentioned above as well as some very well choreographed fights scenes and such. But at the end of the day this show is devastatingly lacking in character and story depth. The characters and their motivation all feel so shallow because the story doesn't properly build up their background to allow it's viewers to really empathize with them.  To sum it up this show is like a very beautiful woman who hardly has anything going for her aside from her physical appearance. Still worth watching, but don't expect too much aside from the visuals and concepts.",5
fire-force,"I love watching Fire Force every week. Is it the best anime that ever existed? Maybe not, but I'm still going to give it 5 stars, because what it does, it does so well. And there are certain elements which I believe are some of the best I've ever seen. The visuals. Honestly I am amazed every week. It is so unique and beautiful and the animation feels so smooth. It uses subtly different styles to emphasise various scenes or emotions in those scenes. The story is very interesting and I can't wait to see how things turn out. It tackles serious themes but breaks the tension with hilarious character interactions. Nothing is overused and I'm always hooked to the screen when watching. It keeps me interested in each moment - so does the pacing! We're only on episode 10 and, considering where we started out, we've come quite a long way! But not so far that it felt rushed. They've used one or two episodes to let things sink in for us and I appreciate that. Another thing about the visuals - the character designs! With each new character I find myself thinking - omg! I love this character! I can't wait to see what they are like. Even for the bad guys. Everything about each character's designs seems so well thought out. Shinra is also a great, well thought out MC. What more could we want?? The OP and ED are (sorry for this) literally FIRE!!!! I listen to it like I'd listen to regular music. What I mean is, I wouldn't just put it in a ""great anime OPs"" playlist, I would put it in a playlist among other great songs... does that make sense? I hope so! Anyway... I could say a lot more. But I don't want to ramble. The directing of the show is great and so is the voice acting. I can't wait for more.",5
fire-force,"ANIMATION is on point!! Awesome sound design. Awesome fight scenes. Interesting characters. Oh and best waifus of Summer 2019 (imo). Yeah, there's some nice sauce~DETAILS: Humans spontaneously combust into fire monsters, and Fire Force is a special unit that deals with them. The often misunderstood main character joins the Fire Force to be a hero after the tragic death of his family. Company 8 (main character's team) tries to unravel the secrets of corruption and find the reason why humans combust with many battles along the way.",5
fire-force,"this show is definetly popping off now and if you are reading this and you are a anime only, this series is about to get super dark and serious just you wait. my only complaint with the show is that david production isnt doing all the animation but i have no other complaints. this show is definetly a five star show but in general i wish they removed the star system because it could ruin interest in shows.",3
fire-force,"Manga reader here!So do you remember a show called Soul Eater? Did you enjoy the style, presentation, world building and character introspects that drove the plot into multiple interesting turns and themes? Well the same author is back with a different setting and theme for his story, but in terms of writing, has not miss a a beat. Especially with the world building and general presentation part.",5
fire-force,"I don’t know what much to say about this anime except that the animation aesthetic is absolutely stunning. I mean it’s unexpected from David Pro in my opinion (apart from the animation of JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure). Ive usually found David Pro’s other works to be well “just good” in the animation part. Anyhow, so far I’ve enjoyed all of the characters and even with the antagonists, I’ve yet to actually find myself disliking any them. If you’ve watched Soul Eater, then I’d highly recommend checking this out too as the original manga of Fire Force is written and drawn by the same mangaka.",5
fire-force,"One of the best series ive watched this year. The pacing of the narative leaves you craving more. The animation is top notch and each fight is a pleasure to watch from things as minor as the wisps of smoke to the way the fire swirls and warps, there are very few cuts made to indicate force. The audio of this series is heavy and you can feel each burst of fire from our MC. Overall this anime is one you should definitely watch regardless of personal tastes. PS - Who doesnt like jet feet?!!",5
fire-force,i am hearing a lot of mixed things about this show so i wanted to watch it for my self and i am confused on why people dont like this cause this show is god tier. the characters in this how are awesome to the point where i already want figures of them and the story is also really cool to because we will learn more about the infernals more later in the series and i cant wait for more and the tournement arc,5
fire-force,"So far the show is pretty good.  Decent characters, great animation, quick moving story which is both good and can be abrupt, and a somewhat interesting plot premise that is mysterious enough to keep you invested.  The biggest issue I have with the show so far is that it doesn't just feel like a shounen show, it specifically already feels like My Hero Academia. I won't pull specific examples so no spoilers, but if you're familiar with MHA you should see the parallels. This show feels heavily inspired in a lot of areas.  Not necessarily a bad thing, but that just means it feigns originality rather than is actually original. Still, I feel like it will be one of the better shows this season.",5
fire-force,"i discovered this series when i heard it was by the same creator as soul eater. And i can say it's become one of my favorite series of all time. i think it does a good job setting itself apart from soul eater while using that art style we all know and love. I was so excited for the anime and was blown away by the first episode, of course though first episodes are usually the best but, the second episode delivered greatly. I'm really liking the directing of the show, the sound effects, and the camera shots i feel give the show a certain uniqueness. looking forward the the rest!",5
sword-art-online,"Well this is my first review. As most of you know there are light novels for this series, all of which I have read. And this has been perhaps the best read I've had in ages. The storyline, characters, vastness of the world and romance between asuna and kirito are perfect, and the twists will leave you dying for more. If you're here for an anime with a great storyline, have played any rpgs or enjoy a little romance mixed with action and suspense, then this is the anime for you. Although there has only been 4 episodes (at the time of this review), the anime has covered a substantial part of volume 2 in the sword art series, so from here on out the main and incredible storyline will be followed. Animation & Audio: 10/10The animation is beautiful to say the least, and will no doubt accurately represent the amazing setting from the light novels as well as the character models. The voice acting for the main characters Asuna and Kirito have been spot on (of course), and the sound quality is overall, like the animation, perfect.Story & Characters: 10/10As I hinted at above, the story will have you hooked from the beginning , I'm sure many of you have played rpgs, and if you died in those rpgs, you'd respawn and try again of course. But in this anime, the rpg becomes real life, if you health bar drops you're killed almost instantly in real life. With that kind of premise, this anime will be very suspenseful and engaging.I'll focus on the main characters for now because most of the others haven't been fairly introduced yet. Off the bat you can tell Kirito isn't the average anime protagonist, he chooses to go solo for the sake of his own survival rather than stay with his ""noob"" friend and protecting him in the VRMMORPG. This might seem like a shortcoming, but in the novels he quickly changes upon meeting Asuna (his main love interest+party member), and becomes a character you'll love. Asuna is very strong willed and at first seems to contrast with the anti-social and awkward Kirito, but we later find out how similar they are, and their relationship is perhaps the best I've seen in any other anime or manga.Overall/Rewatch Value: 10/10This anime will only be about 25 or 26 episodes long, covering just volumes 1,2, and perhaps some of 8 in the process, if it does well enough movies and ovas or even another season could be launched, allowing us to further immerse in this incredible universe. And I'm sure by the time this anime is finished (or long before), everyone will be rushing to read the novels, and they won't be disappointed!",4.5
sword-art-online,"When I first watched SAO I was hooked. The premise had been done before but that didn't stop me getting in the show. I figured Kirito could grow to be an interesting considering his position in the world. But the show never gave him any true obstacles to overcome. He was literally perfect or things just worked his way. I mean him trying to be a loner so he wouldn't have to see others was ok. But after a few episodes he was so overpowered he never had to worry. He was paper thin as a character.  Even worse than that the show moved at such a break neck pace I'm surprised I didn't  catch whiplash from it. The pacing was brutal and character development suffered because of it. The show introduced so many characters and we would only see then occasionally. Most of them seemed great but outside of a few brief appearances we never learn more about them. This made believing in Kirito and Asuna romance difficult. It just happened so fast and the show expected us to just accept a character we hardly know is his soul mate. That brings me to the second half. It was entirely pointless and creepy! The return to the real world, his sister/cousin crush, and the vaudeville villain ruined the show. First off they skip over the real world ramifications of the game. We hardly even hear anyone talk about what happened. I mean 10,000 people were trapped for two years and it's basically swept under the rug. We never really see any characters recover from the order at.The show just skips ahead two months. The second half could have dealt with them recovering and making their love work in a world that they don't know anymore. That would have been amazing. But I digress. Then the whole sister/cousin plot line was beyond uncomfortable. It just comes out of no where and makes no sense. We barely know Sugu and she's just trusted into the forefront. Every time she was on screen with Kirito I cringed. They could have taken her character is a completely different direction. Maybe making her a little sister desperate to make a bond with the brother she has become distant with. That would have made her presence make more sense and 1000 times less creepy. But by far my biggest issue with the show is Sugo! He's horrible as a villain and character. Firstly how did he make a game that uses a newer nerve gear and get people to play it? No one in their right mind would use anything like that after the SAO incident. Secondly why would he announce his evil plans to Kirito? Why not just marry her and continue your plans in secret. For a genius he seems extremely stupid. And I don't even want to get started on the final show down. I was angry but couldn't stop laughing it was laughably bad! They should have just had he get run off and kept that outrageous melodrama for something else. I'm not trying to be overly critical of the show. In all honesty I wanted this show to be great they just wasted the chance. I would have loved for them to just slow the pace and let all the characters grow and maybe did a new arc in a second season. At least they'd have a roster of characters we know and care about to keep us hooked.",5
sword-art-online,"When I read the summary of this anime, it actually caught my attention. Surviving in a game that could mean death just sounded interesting. Hence, I decided to give this anime a try. Watching the first few episodes, I truly believed this anime had an amazing vision, and it was going to deliver on it. Sadly it was not to be. The story goes from one of an epic quest to survive towards one basically of a romantic comedy. By the time you go into the second arc, the story drastically goes downhill. The characters honestly felt promising. However, due to time constraints, they were never fully realized. As a result, most of them are bland and have no depth. This anime should have expanded the first arc to the full 25 episodes. It would have given the story plenty of time to grow and for the ending to feel truly great. I know it would have been a masterpiece if it did. Sadly the reality isn't so. Still the action is amazing,and the music is good. Also as generic and stale quite a few episodes got, the series delivered them so well, I often forgot the major flaws in the show. So an okay anime, but it could have been amazing.",2
sword-art-online,"Pros:+ Good action scenes.+ Cool concept.Cons:- Only half the show was good, the next half became less interesting, and seemed to follow the old ""Save the damsel in distress trope."" - Not all the characters were interesting. Some died off way to quickly before even starting to like them.. I was blown away from the beginning of this anime, it was so unique, and has the best fighting scenes i have ever seen in anime period. Unfortunately, the anime slows down, and doesn't seem to ever pick up the action, and the characters such as Asuna, loses character development, and becomes the normal girl who needs her boyfriend to do everything, and save her. It had a great beginning, but i started to lose interest toward the end. Score: C+The Movie Review.It was literally a GIANT recap... Skip it if you have already seen the show.",3
sword-art-online,"So this show is pretty good. The first half is great 4/5 stars. But it's bogged down by the second half of the series which merits 2/5 stars. And here's why:The first half of the series is about people who are trapped in a game that they have to clear to escape. The catch is, if they die in game they die in real life. This makes for some compelling scenes. For one, it actually matters if people die in game. The series can explore the results of actual death and the behavioral patterns that come with it, granted they don't do this as much as they should. They barely explored the PK aspects or the people who choose to not even bother, or the people that band together to help worse players survive. They briefly go over these topics but mostly focus on the main character.So the first half follows our main character who is a solo player and his quest to clear the game, on his way he falls in love with a chick he meets and their love for each other just magically manifests out of practically thin air, He seems to like her because she's pretty and can cook, and she seems to like him because he's a nice guy and strong. That this is all it takes for ""love"" to occur is indicative of the immaturity of anime as genre and the cultural problems and stereotypes associated with the Japanese. As with most anime you get the normal sexist stereotyping of women as helpless, supporting characters who generally are good cooks and unconfident cry-babies. You can imagine my surprise when asuna turns out to be a capable swordsman. Of course she's only capable when it's convenient. Often times she still needs big tough kirito to save her or to take on the tougher enemies. Even in major boss battles that should not be solo-able asuna tends to take a supporting role. But let's ignore the flaws almost all anime have with predictable character architecture and story telling. The world is pretty. Some of the storylines of minor character make the plight of being trapped more real. Some characters don't get explored enough. It's like the makers of this anime looked at .hack//sign which had a very similar overall story plot but chose to tell the story through dialogue and character development. The makers of SAO said, let's not do that, let's make it an action show with lazy character development.The most interesting character choice was to give asuna and kirito a child. But this lasts only one episode in the first half and has no more relevancy until the second half where the child becomes merely a supporting character with no more significance than an information source and plot device.The resolution of the story for the first half is arguably the weakest part of the story-telling. It felt rushed and poorly thought out. For instance, early in the series they get an item that allows you to revive someone 10 seconds after death, preventing them from dying. Kirito gives this item to klein who is at the scene of the final battle. But rather than have Klein use the item to revive asuna, or revive kirito to finish off the boss, kirito just gets mad and ignore the fact that he just died and as a ghost kills the boss. It was super lazy story telling I've come to expect from anime. Also the revelation of the final boss and how quickly that came about and also how the main character had already fought the final boss before makes the final fight kinda boring and uninteresting. Overall the first half of the story merits 4/5 stars at best. Interesting side character story lines that should've been fleshed out and more in depth make the series good. Lazy story telling and stereotypical anime flaws bring it down from 5 stars.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The second half of the anime is terrible. They spend time introducing a flying control device and then the very next scene and episode that control device is entirely irrelevant. Let's ignore that this is poor game design to have a control device for flight that becomes irrelevant the moment you try to learn to fly the right way, this is blatant filler which just goes to show that this second half of the season was just to make money off a brand that was popular. The second half focus' on kirito's quest to save asuna who no longer is a capable warrior but a damsel in distress incapable of saving herself. The one time I thought they might actually let her escape on her own and be relevant to the plot as anything more than a trophy to capture from the final boss led to disappointment. It makes all the airtime they spent showing her learning the code to her cage and escaping pointless because it leads nowhere. It does nothing more than to motivate kirito to try to suicide out of desperation into ""heaven"" or the top of the tree, w/e. The entire result of that sequence is, we know asuna is there for sure and the new supporting character, kirito's sister figures out kirito is her brother. Which at MANY, and I mean MANY points could have happened if these two characters had half a brain or interacted at all in real life like human beings.Which brings me to why this second half is f-ing terrible. It's all about how kirito's sister is apparently in ""love"" with her brother who is in love with Asuna. But then she meets kirito and over the course of a week, yes you heard me, a week, falls in love with the online persona of kirito, her brother but she doesn't know that. The very fact that she thinks she loves somebody she just met on an online game is already pathetic story telling. They have no bond other than she thinks he's a nice guy and he's strong. But she has very little context for this other than him saving her and her game leader by fighting and killing players (who don't die permanantly obviously).After barely knowing the guy she is in love with him, she also still loves her brother for some unexplained reason, despite the story even telling us that he and her barely interact at all in real life in the first half of the story. Apparently Japanese women are very easily attracted to guys because all you have to do is be nice to them a few times and they will fucking die to have you love them if you're a man.Of course it eventually breaks her heart when the brother she hardly interacts with winds up loving asuna. So she clings to kirito as her love. Of course, in the most convoluted way, she winds up finding out that kirito is her brother and is heartbroken.I guess they are trying to form some sort of love triangle romance. But that's what makes the second half of this series so shitty. For one, the love triangle isn't believable. It's hard to even feel bad for sugu when she has her heart broken because her love isn't believable at all. We have no context to understand why she would love the main character so much other than that he's the main character and she loves him. At least with Asuna x kirito we have some scenes that show them together and growing closer through shared circumstances of terror, fear, joy, etc. What makes this fact the problem with the series is that nothing else really interesting happens at all. Many people complain that they feel the episodes are getting shorter in the comments on the videos. You know why this is? Because more and more screen time is given to this drama that doesn't really matter and less and less time is given to actual story progression. The pacing of this show turned into a fantasy show to soap opera between story arcs.And that's why the second half gets 2/5 stars. The fact that death isn't a consequence means there's no tension in any of the scenes for the second half and they lean to heavily on the ""romance.""Because you can't separate these halves you get 3/5 stars as my over all review for the series. If the second half of the series had never happened, and they just ended the first half with asuna and kirito waking up and living happily ever after, that would make this series worth 4/5 stars.",3
sword-art-online,"When I first heard of SAO it was during the time it aired, back in late 2012. I didn't watch it at the time because, for whatever reason, I thought it would be lame and didn't even give it a chance. At the time, at quick glance, it looked childish. This is something I do a lot. I hate wasting time and lots of times will over look what in fact is a stellar show. SAO was one of those cases. This show is absolutely amazing.I am very glad I gave this show the chance it deserved a few weeks ago. I've watched my fair share of anime and I can truthfully say I have never come across a show as engrossing or addicting as this. The characters seem to have a depth of emotion and believability that at times was heartwarming, sad, inspiring, at times comical, scary and even would make me angry. And I think that is the heart of the show. The concept is great, as any hardcore MMORPG player can tell you, but its the characters and their own struggles and relations that are the heart of the show. The Kirito x Asuna love story is among the best in anime; alongside an awesome cast it makes for a great combination. You'll see these normal people, some that become great leaders or martyrs, others that fall into the depths of insanity and evil, all trapped in a virtual world where death is real and always just around the corner. That is why you should watch this show.",3
sword-art-online,"There can be little doubt that SAO is one of, if not the best new shows of the season. That being said, I have some significant issues with the pacing and ending of the first story arc, and since the reviews for this show on CR are almost entirely 5-star ravings of how amazing the show is without any critique, I'm endeavoring to fill that void. There are plenty of things SAO does well, but if you want to know about that, read the other reviews. If you are curious to know why this show isn't the second coming of Trigun, read on.Beware: minor spoilers ahead, but I'll do my best to be vague about specific plot points.Episodes 3-6 were relatively weak. Instead of continuing from where the first two episodes left off, the plot jumps two years into the future and tells isolated stories about side characters you have no reason to care about, while the main character himself is never in any real danger, so the tension of the death game the first episodes create is lost. Would have preferred more time spent in the first few months with all the chaos and tension which would have arisen from thousands of trapped and terrified gamers.Episodes 7-13 are better, with the two main characters relationship being developed, allowing the viewer to actually care about their well-being (as opposed to the side characters in the early episodes, whose peril is supposed to invoke serious drama, but when you've only known them for 15 minutes, their death is rather meaningless). There are still side characters who pass through with their own drama which I felt detracted from the main story, but at least now the main characters were developed enough to keep you engaged and rooting for them.Episode 14 (big spoilers here) was horribly disappointing. An epic boss fight begun in the previous episode is ended abruptly and with barely a whimper. The villain is revealed, and then defeated via what is essentially magic (the main characters performing feats outside the bounds of the game's programming, aka the writers cheated). Finally, the mass-murdering creator of the game, when asked why he did this, literally says ""I forgot."" How compelling...or not.The next story arc has only just begun, but looks promising and I will continue to watch SAO every Saturday. However, I wish the writers would take a better look at the pacing and give the anime time to develop all characters at a reasonable speed, not just the main two protagonists. I realize this is based on a manga which goes into greater depths on many plot points, but this anime has enough potential on its own not to be shackled into retelling the meta-narrative of the manga in an abridged form.",5
sword-art-online,"This is my very first review.Setting: I did like the setting. The first three episodes were a good following to the plot, but after that, it went downhill ( In my opinion ). There was countless fillers, and the second half wasn't even necessary.Characters:I did like Kirito's character, but everything in SAO just went his way. Like the time where he almost died to Kuradeel, for example.Asuna was good the first few episodes, but became useless in anything without Kirito.Animation:The animation was nice, especially at the boss fights. Well, that's it. This isn't a bad anime, but it could've been better..",5
sword-art-online,"Beautiful and engaging, this series makes you see and think what some might do if trapped in a world where life is safe only if you engage the dangers that surround you. The main characters in this story pull at your heart strings as they struggle to escape this trap of epic proportions. Action, suspense, life, death, and love, this story keeps you hanging on every plot twist and turn, making you want more. I hope to see what challenges Kirito and Asuna overcome if they continue the series as far as the manga progressed.",3
sword-art-online,"SAO probably has my favorite first few episodes in any anime. It hooked me right from the start with excellent visuals and an awesome story that no gamer could resist. It continued being solid for the first 14 episodes. Then they moved to AO... I was kind of shocked honestly. The stakes aren't nearly as high, the villain is annoying, the character models aren't nearly as cool, and they took away Asuna's badassness. I could go on but I'll some it up by saying that the last 10 episodes were awful. Stop at 14.",3
sword-art-online,"First off this isn't the ""BEST ANIME EVER"", just to be clear.With that being said though, it is still a great anime.Sword Art Online, an adaptation of a short series manga worthy of being a recommendation on anyone's list. The anime revolves around Kirito, a teenage boy who is trapped in a virtual MMO game with 10'000 other players. The premise of the game is to fight up the tower of which they start in and reach the 100th floor, whilst avoiding death at all cost as dying in game results in dying in real life. The anime story is quite solid, based around the concept of being able to be in a virtual game (Body and all)  is a great start (who doesn't want to be able to go INTO a game right?). The anime is solely based on Kirito's journey in the game, which is its first downfall however, seeing as the other characters lacked a lot of depth that they should have gotten (Characters such as Klien and Egil, look like such interesting characters, but almost seem like strangers since we dont know anything about them..) However it is understandable seeing as this is a short series anime. Another problem with the story was the time jumps, as said previously the anime is a short anime, therefore it was necessary to do this, however I think that most people, including me would have preferred if the anime continued longer; which would have allowed us to continue to watch the journey of Kirito AS WELL as the other characters in the anime (I'm sure there were much more adventures and monsters). The only other character that gets any sufficient depth would be Asuna, Kirito's romantic interest, which is also a nice addition to the anime as there is a lot of romance elements in the anime which is very well done as well.With this being said, the anime still does remarkably well. With the first few episodes being extremely engaging and entertaining with the introduction to a virtual gaming world, as well as the loss of friends and comrades. However the anime does lose this momentum as it goes onto its latter episodes, which is probably due to the lack of depth the anime actually gave to the characters and the world itself. Seeing as the animation in this anime is very beautiful with vast landscapes and bustling towns, the animation and artwork alone can be compared to that of other top tier anime.All in all, the anime does well as it was very entertaining to watch. With an awe inspiring world that SHOULD have been showed off more (I think most viewers didn't really even care about the artwork, as it was not emphasized much.) and captivating journey of Kirito and Asuna, with the emotional short stories of friendship and loss. Sword Art Online is a must watch on my list, however the anime leaves viewers with a bit of an empty feeling at the end which is the thing that stops me from giving this anime a full 5/5, as everyone i believe, knows that this anime COULD have been and SHOULD have been even better.(None the less, its still a great anime :] ) 4 / 5 stars :DIf you liked this review, please give it a thumbs up and check out my profile for other anime reviews",4.5
sword-art-online,"The title says it all. Any novel-to-anime adaptation, if you're read the original text, is going to fall far short of the source in terms of story and detail. This doesn't doom a series, or no adaptation would ever come out - any half-competent writer and director can make the resulting product entertaining while stripping out parts that would not adapt well to a video/audio medium. In the case of SAO, this is done. But a whooooole lot of content is gone, and what's left is a pretty generic romance/heroic shounen story with a mildly interesting premise. Production values are decent - a solid voice acting cast gives life to the characters, and Yuki Kajiura's familiar rises can be heard during action-packed sequences.But for all the bells and whistles, there's not a whole of interesting meat to it. Kirito and Asuna's love story is a decent one but even in the novels it devolves into a damsel-in-distress plus harem situation, which the author actually apologized for because he needed to sell copies and establish a franchise before he had room to write the stories he wanted. The SAO anime is no different, yet even less interesting.If a second season is going to be made, I hope the writers take a good luck at the immense amount of source material they have to work with. A boy/girl romance and heroic struggle may put your foot in the door, but SAO has a wealth of interesting topics and storylines (Mother's Rosario, the Aincrad short stories) that deserve to be animated. I don't have a lot of faith this studio will pull it off, because they seem to value sexy fanservice more than a good plot.",4.5
sword-art-online,"This was one of my very favorite anime up until the second half. The beginning was awesome and so much fun, but the plot changed half way and it became disappointing and difficult to watch. Significant flaws:-The biggest letdown for me was how Asuna, who was so awesome, powerful, and cool, became totally helpless and pathetic in the second half. -Towards the end it got really cheesy and everyone cried all the time. -The final battle scenes were dragged out and exhausting, which made them loose all suspense and excitement.  Positive aspects:-the animation is awesome and the movements are clean.-the music is well done and fits the scenes-Kirito's and Asuna's love in the first half is really sweet and romantic-the original concept is really awesome!This is one of the most overrated anime of all time, such a let down! It really started to go downhill after around episode eighteen or so, and it got so bad that it totally ruined the entire anime. I might rewatch the series up to the fourteenth episode, and not continue from there because I love the first half so much. I feel bad for giving SAO two stars ><Anyway, I'd recommend Sword Art Onine if you are looking for a great anime concept, but only if you are willing to be let down in the end.",5
sword-art-online,"Overall:So first things first, I'm a fan of SAO and enjoyed what I saw of it (haven't read the light novel), but I do think that it's a bit overrated. All the praise SAO has been getting is a bit exaggerated in my opinion. Nonetheless, I still liked the show. I would actually give it a 3.5, but Crunchy doesn't allow that, so I guess I'll be generous.Note: Spoilers are specific points that I complain about. May or may not contain spoilers (all the events are at the beginning though, so it doesn't reveal anything really)Plot:This show had MAJOR potential as many of you may have seen from the first episode. It was thrilling, eventful, and really well done. But then, everything sort of just went downhill from there. Don't let that sentence scare you; as I said, it's still a really enjoyable show. The pacing of the SAO arc was terrible. Things didn't flow together, time didn't seem to flow right.  Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideOne problem I had was the fact that it took so long to clear the first floor, but such a short amount of time relatively to clear the other 70 floors.  They could have done so much more if they expanded on the actual adventure and let us see more of the SAO world. Actually, it might have been better if they had the SAO arc as a 25 episode season. If given the time, SAO could have explained things better and created more atmosphere and emotion. The psychological aspect of SAO could have been expanded on. The first episode made me think that there would be something more in terms of watching how characters acted. Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideThe whole part with Sachi was done poorly. I didn't feel all that sad for Sachi; she didn't really have a story, or any role at all. She was just sort of... there. She was a very shallow character with no development at all that just couldn't manage to make me cry for her death.  The psychological aspect isn't really built upon and what they did try to do just ended up becoming filler because of the poor execution. That's a loss on SAO's part. It had such great potential that it didn't utilize.Characters:Cliche. Kirito's awesome and OPed. He's the hero. He's the one who saves everybody. Everything goes his way. But hey, that's a lot of animes. In doesn't take away from the experience. My problem was that he didn't have much character for the SAO arc. He was a bit too... dull. Most of the characters were actually kind of shaky.  Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideI still don't understand why Kirito treated Klein so coldly in the beginning. Would you stop being such a weirdo? You're so kind and helpful one moment, and the next you're jaded and too cool to even look others in the eye.  None had much personality, and all were pretty bland. There wasn't much character development, and that goes hand in hand with plot development. Again, the psychological aspect would have done wonders here. Still, some characters were really solid and worked well. Of course, some of these characters were filler and completely unneeded. Lisbeth for example was a filler character. Inter-character development could also have been worked on. The character designs were beautiful.Visuals:I loved the art style of SAO. It's just one of those styles that is easy to get used to and easy to like. The characters were designed well with everyone's personal styles displayed. It also let you get the feel of how they fought. Along with the characters, the landscapes are also beautiful. The art is very consistent throughout, and so is the animation. The futuristic gameplay animations were awesome. I enjoyed the little first person POV parts where we get to see the game from their own eyes. The fight sequences were nicely done which is always a plus.Audio:The voice acting for this show was pretty well done. Everything seemed right, and nothing came out awkward. Pretty run of the mill stuff. It's good I would say. As for the music, the little tracks played throughout the anime were fitting and timed right, helping to add some atmosphere. The opening and ending themes were pretty standard-- again, nothing special about it. They were good songs mind you, just not anything I instantly fell in love with.Extra:I didn't really consider the ALO arc in this review of mine because as I stated previously, SAO would have done better with 25 episodes devoted to the SAO arc. But to get the other season of this anime, here's some extra thoughts on the ALO arc. I stand by my previous statements about the visuals and audio. As for the characters, Kirito progressively got more solid, and his character became more well defined in this arc. Sugu was also a pretty solid character-- not sure why a lot of people dislike her. Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideHer actions are entirely believable, and just as a note: It's not incest. She didn't do anything other than confess. So what if you like your cousin? It's understandable that you'd probably fall in love with them after they suddenly do a personality switch and go from uncaring and cold to loving and kind (especially when you've been craving their attention for years).  The villain, I agree, is just way too... cliche and shallow. He's just a creep. Definitely not the best villain.  Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideAnd the perverted creepiness just threw me off-- I don't want to see Asuna get nearly raped. What is this. Just stop it. And tentacles?! Since when did you have to turn to fan service to pull in views SAO?! One problem that persisted through the SAO arc to the ALO arc was the lack of psychological development and the inconsistency of the characters' mentality. Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hide Kirito, stop hanging out enjoying yourself with those clan leaders, go save Asuna already. Anyway, the plot was not as interesting as the one for the SAO arc, and it had a pretty slow start, but once it picked up, I found myself sitting at the edge of my seat again as I waited for the next episode.",5
sword-art-online,"So I've never actually been an avid anime enthusiast over a good portion of my life but I've been marathoning hundreds of hours of anime shows the past two weeks for a reason unbeknownst to me, maybe to induce myself into a depression or find the meaning of life.  I do want to give my thoughts about Sword Art Online mostly because I feel it's message hit more at home with me.  I've lived the experience as i've played MMORPG's over the past 10 years myself.  I know what it is to find people with common goals and form new relationships that transcend the virtual space into reality.  So it is kind of hard to talk about this anime series without spoiling some major plot points so I guess this review is more directed at other people who have already finished watching it.  As I have just marathoned all 25 current episodes I don't know whether these were broadcast into separate seasons so I'll just split them by story arcs which would be Sword Art Online and ALfheim Online and reflect upon them separately. So skip the sections below if you really want to avoid spoilers.Sword Art Online (episodes 1-14)Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideSo going into Sword Art Online(SAO) I didn't know what to expect as I have not read any of the light novels or read any other reviews online about it.  I was thinking maybe it would be a light hearted take on online gaming but once the main villain appears and sets up the rules of world to the thousands of players in the main plaza it immediately became a serious life and death situation as dying in the virtual world would kill the person in reality.  The real death penalty premise was probably the most brilliant part of the story as the tension it created made every situation matter to the lives of everyone now living in this virtual world and shows us the comradery and corruption that builds up between this community of players which parallels real society in many ways.Of course the main goal in Sword Art Online is to get out and to do that the community has to clear a series of floors and dungeons which hold some powerful bosses that block progression throughout the game.  So the anime borrows alot of simple gaming concepts like health pools, equipment, experience, and general skill progression to convey the power and abilities these people have in the game.  So if you've played a few MMO's or Role Playing Games the terminology is pretty familiar.So one major complaint that I had was that the pacing of the first few episodes was going way too fast and I felt that alot of characters early on didn't get the exposition that they deserved.  For example Sachi seemed like a character who probably could have used another episode to convey a stronger relationship between her and Kirito because she was probably the first person he cared about or even started to love so I felt that maybe her death could have had more of an emotional impact on the viewers so that we could also feel as tormented as Kirito was while he listened to her final goodbye message.  Also other characters like Klein, Silica, Lizbeth seemed underused and basically only appear to build up Kirito's character and showing us what kind of guy he is.After the hastened first half of this story arc we finally get to the real Kirito and Asuna relationship.  They meet early on in the story but they don't journey together after their first few meetings.  So It isn't till a year later that they start to develop feelings for each other but I thought this relationship took the time it needed to demonstrate that while they never met in reality their bond was indeed real and they loved each other enough to protect each other in times of need.  In essence the relationship between Kirito and Asuna is the main theme of the series and many subplots explore the relationship up to a point where they build their own virtual family.Overall I felt satisfied with the way this arc ended and I kind of wish they explored the mind of the main villain some more as he seemed interesting.  The last battle was was a test of the human condition and overcoming it led to their somewhat bittersweet victory.  It was a relief to know that the nightmare was over for those left alive in SAO.ALfheim Online (episodes 15-25)Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideThis story arc is a bit shorter than SAO but I feel it's a more much focused narrative.  Kirito is finally out of the death trap but not all is well back in the real world as his one and only true love Asuna is still living a life of virtual reality as she did not wake up so to save her he has to go back into the online world.  So the basic story line becomes a save the princess type of video game trope.What I found most interesting about this story arc is not so much Kirito's determination to get his love back but rather his sister Suguha's(Leafa) development throughout these episodes.  Even though Kirito isn't technically her brother(adopted cousin) she develops intimate feelings for him and she knows he will never return the same feelings as he is too consumed with Asuna in the real world.  So she escapes into the virtual world ALfeim online and in an ironic twist falls in love with Kirito's avatar in ALfeim online as well.  The revelation when Kirito and Leafa realize that they know each other is done very well.  I couldn't help but feel sympathetic towards Suguha as it was a brutal and soul crushing way to find out that that the person she could possibly fall in love with and forget about her brother in the real world was in the end actually her brother as well.As for the actual society and type of game ALfeim online is I feel doesn't hold the same appeal as SAO.  There is no real tension or drama that you could possibly care about even though there seems to be a well thought out faction system but they really don't get into the politics all too much other than a few scenes where Kirito makes a few friends in high places that sort of help him on his journey to the World Tree. I also thought the new villain was sort of underwhelming, while Sugou is a fairly scummy guy his presence as the main villain just doesn't quite match up to Kayaba Akihiko.Asuna while being the main motivation for Kirito's quest to save her has a fairly limited role and seems pretty helpless even though it's been shown previously that she is powerful person.  I guess I could see why they maybe wanted to put her in this role, perhaps it was more or less to show the will power she has to keep on living despite being stuck in a world of solitude.I felt the ending was actually pretty good, the Kirito and Asuna moment in the hospital was a very memorable moment and you get to see alot of characters return in the final moments to celebrate the events of the past few years.  It's safe to say that we haven't seen the last of Kirito, Asuna, and Leafa as the World Seed program seems to bring new life to other virtual worlds and it's fairly implied that there is more to come in the future which I am thrilled about as I see there is much more potential in this series but if they never continue the anime I wouldn't say I'd be dissapointed as things wrap up pretty well.I honestly enjoyed my time with Sword Art Online as I feel it's greatest strength is the way it conveys online relationships within a close community of players.  The real death penalty of the game only amplifies the emotional bonds the cast of characters experience which truly brings out who they really are as humans beings and further implies the message that even though they live in a virtual world the experiences they had with each other are very much real life experiences.",5
sword-art-online,"As many other reviewers point out, this show is good however it is overrated. Many who can relate or want to relate to the main character will find enjoyment in the show. However if you read any of the reviews out there that are not 5 stars you will get a better picture of what the anime has to offer. Now most of the faults that are in the anime are due to the limitations of a seasonal Anime, such as huge time skips or lack of character development. However i was a sucker and enjoyed the concept of the series and found a translated copy of the light novel. I have to say the written story fills in where the anime lacks. Just like when a book in turned into the movie, many aspects have to be cut from the story to fit the format that is a movie/film. Now its always difficult to compare an anime to its written counterpart (manga or light novel). which is why i give this show a 3/5. If you want read a better review, search for any review that's 2-4 stars. They are likely going to give it an honest review with out the Fanfreaking.",3
sword-art-online,"The story begins on the right foot, establishing its solid concept, and showing off its wondrous animation and backdrops.  However, from there it rapidly plummets in terms of keeping the plot coherent and worthwhile, meaning that despite the great visuals and music, the show can't build up any dramatic tension and therefore is a mostly dull watch.  This occurs due to two main reasons: one, the main character is shown to be perfect in near every regard, and therefore any drama that could have occurred regarding failure is removed as an option; second, early on the plot progresses at a very rapid pace, skipping all character development in a two year segment of time in-game until the all important romance begins, at which point things slow way, way down, and the plot is derailed for around 5 episodes.  To the shows credit however, it pulled off a rather surprising twist in the middle quite well, despite falling back on a deus ex machina moment to explain it. Yet following this twist the show moves forward and proceeds to rid itself of all its redeeming qualities, removing the life or death stakes, locking its strong female character in a cage for 10 episodes, and shifting to a whole new set of characters, which it never takes the time to develop either.Overall, the first 14 episodes aren't absolutely horrible, even if they fail to live up to the concept, yet the remainder of the show is better off skipped.",4
sword-art-online,"Okay, seriously. I need to stop putting off animes that people suggest to me. It seems every time someone suggests something, I end up crying at the end or just laughing until I cough out a lung. Except for Air Gear, I simply don't like that anime.With that, you know when people call something ""not your typical anime""? I've watched those. They're as unique as the tree you point out in the forest, or as easy to point out as a very specific beige car on the freeway. They're really just run-of-the-mills anime that one person decided they enjoyed so much.Safe to say, I didn't find that with Sword Art Online. Sword Art Online is as unique as a $300,000 sports car. It sticks out like a man wearing red in a crowd of black. It's the student that outshines everyone with their top-notch grades.That just means that Sword Art Online is amazing.Plot: It progresses quickly, but slow enough for you to understand the sequence of events. That's what makes it solid. As for the actual plot itself, the basic idea is being trapped in a game, and you have to beat it in order to return to the real world. It's easy enough, but you're only given one life. That sounds just like a bunch of other shows, but the execution is done well. That's 10,000 players on Sword Art Online who are trapped in the virtual world until any one of them beats the game. The premise of the story has happened before, but the way that Sword Art Online does it had me hooked from the beginning. For this type of genre, I find it really difficult to get hooked, only because the story is usually played-out. Characters: There's a female character, Asuna, who fights alongside the main protagonist, who in the second half of the story, acts as the damsel in distress. Despite all that, Princess Peach does not make an appearance. The main character, Kirito, is very reminiscent of Simon from Gurren Lagann; their looks for one, and the way they develop as the story moves along. It's a good thing that the characters in this story aren't useless; a useless character would simply sit there and wait for the protagonist to be their savior (okay, that happens with about 6,000 of the players, but who really cares about what they're doing?).Content: I'll throw it out there that there are some ecchi-like scenes in the second half, but you won't be enjoying yourself the whole way through and as soon as they start, you'll probably want to punch your screen (good job writers!). I also like that the story takes place in a fantasy world, but still draws its roots from the fact that it's a video game. You'll see a character's HUD from time-to-time, and then watch them scroll through their menu in almost every episode, and that's what I think is great about this show. It stays true to its roots and recognizes the fact that it's focusing on a mere adaptation of the main characters.This show, in a sense, is run similar to a harem, but there is only one other character that Kirito will show affection for, aside from Asuna (don't worry, you'll see that relationship coming as soon as you watch it, so it's not even spoiled that I mentioned her name). That's a definite plus for authenticity, and it stops all of the fans from going into a full-blown fan war of who Kirito should end up with in the end. It's so defined, that there's no way to contest it, and contesting it is like asking for the majority of the fans to start a riot in front of your house.Wow, I do have a lot to write about this topic after all, but it seems I've only been watching animes that make me cry this entire week. For some reason, they do make me feel terrible because of how heart-wrenching the events are, but Sword Art Online ties up its loose ends in a satisfying ending. That's a first for this week, and I ended up crying anyways because it ended (such a crybaby). The amount of emotional content in this anime is high, mixed with all the visually-appealing action sequences that happen with a justifiable reason (and yes, a justifiable reason is important to start an action sequence). Miscellaneous: On my to-do list: find the MP3 for the openings and endings. All the music is great, but I hardly noticed. I was too enamored with the storyline that I had no mind to actually listen to the music. The animation reminded me of A Certain Magical Index, in a sense, but while that was the animation style which you can say drew me in, it wasn't the visuals at work. I just kept watching because the anime as a whole drew me in.Overall: You'll simply know when an anime is good, right from watching the first episode. For example, I did say in another review that Lucky Star didn't draw me in from the beginning, but I gave it 5 stars anyways. For some reason, while I didn't like it, I wanted to keep watching, even if I'd sit there bored out of my mind, I was willing to risk just wasting my time. In the end, I enjoyed the series. There's always something about it that keeps you from leaving the screen and there's something that urges you to watch the next episode, and that's what makes it a good series. That's what happened with Sword Art Online.I could've pulled an all-nighter for this anime, but I didn't. I had school the next day. But even as I went to sleep, the only thing that really crossed my mind was finishing that anime. I wasn't really paying attention in class, because I was really just eager to finish. As soon as I got home, that's what I did, and it turns out I was right about wanting to finish; it was bittersweet. I like the ending, but I simply wish I had more to watch. While the ending was satisfying, here's to hoping that they make a Season Two.",3
sword-art-online,"Starts off great with a good storyline. New technology has developed that allows people to play games fully immersed and the flagship game has just launched (sounds like a dream come true to me). Of course things go awry and everyone is trapped in the game until someone clears all the levels. People can actually die in the game and you see real life begin to mix in with the virtual world they're trapped in. Half way through I found myself losing interest as Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hide they beat the first game but ultimately have to go back into another game to find his girlfriend from the first game who had been trapped. I mostly finished for the sake of seeing it to the end. Basically watch it for the first half, stay for the rest if it appeals to you (which it didn't for me)",2
sword-art-online,"Anyone who is a gamer will readily admit to spending numerous hours playing a video game. But what if the game was extreme to the point of being physically impossible to stop playing until you won and an in-game death makes you die in real life?Enter Sword Art Online (SAO), an anime about a video game of the same name. What we have from this show is a survival story set in a high-fantasy world with epic battles and a romance prevailing the virtual veils. Unfortunately, its strengths are balanced out by its weaknesses and for more discerning viewers this can be quite severe. Don’t mistake that for being bad though; for those who can ignore storytelling and character development problems, its strengths more than make up for its weaknesses. Everyone else can expect SAO to be a mixed bag of a series.The first shortcoming of SAO is its abundance of characters. In the first half of the anime the story tries to treat all of them as important but there’s not enough screentime for them to ingratiate themselves to the viewer so it’s hard to care about them when something significant happens. On the other hand, the characters in the earlier part of the series are usually believable compared to almost everyone introduced later on; anyone who wasn’t Suguha was either used for harem fanservice or to give Kirito an opponent. But at least SAO’s second half focuses on the important players of Kirito, Asuna, and Suguha since it didn’t know what to do with everyone else in the first half.This isn’t to say the main trio is flawless though. Kirito switches from someone Hell-bent on saving his friends one moment and being a bleeding heart the next. Multi-sided characters are normally a good thing but Kirito’s differing sides are called exclusively from each other as the plot demands and fails to create any sort of internal dynamic. But this pseudo-one dimensionality wouldn’t be noticeable if it weren’t for Suguha. Suguha has the greatest range of emotion displayed while still keeping the less dominant personality trait passive but noticeable at the moment so that her conflict remains believable; she’s grappling with her own feelings so everything about her should be present. But the best developed of the characters is Asuna. Her change in attitude toward the game and everyone else is subtle and her relationship with Kirito is implied to have developed over a long time in-universe if her gradual changes shown over time are not enough.That’s a good thing since Kirito and Asuna’s relationship is one of SAO’s greatest strengths. There are a few other girls Kirito grows close to but he either meets them before becoming close to Asuna or they get the hint when they see how the two behave around each other. Kirito and Asuna themselves have a balanced dynamic as two warriors who are victorious and defeated in equal measure; neither character is dominant in terms of saving the other. It’s easy for a strong character to be degraded by romance and when it happens here it’s beyond their control and not because of their mushiness; neither suddenly becomes weaker more than it is the enemy being powerful.Unfortunately, this doesn’t exempt Kirito from being subject to random increases in power as the plot demands. We have things like him using a technique that he lost in the first half with as much effectiveness as it previously did in the second half which makes no sense because the technique’s effectiveness requires something programmed into the skill itself and not just his own talent. There’s an explanation of sorts for Kirito’s high base power in the second half but it seems coincidental considering everything else he loses. Other storytelling problems include the final dungeon which doesn’t make sense when one stops to think about the game’s mechanics.The storytelling isn’t all bad though. The first half of the anime does a good job at explaining the gameplay mechanics and usually plays consistently barring a few scenes that make sense in hindsight considering the characters involved. The second half of the anime introduces some lore and new mechanics that aren’t fully explained or demonstrated respectively and seems to lose dramatic tension due to the lack of scope on the urgency. But the conflict is now personal and the time limit of sorts Kirito is on it doesn’t allow him to fully be involved in the game he’s playing out of necessity.But if nothing else the series can’t be faulted on its technical presentation. Barring the troop characters in the various factions, the character designs in SAO are richly varied and colorful down to the minor characters and sometimes lower than that kind of importance; everyone could have been a generic face but Studio A-1 Pictures opts to make the game feel like an entire world with its players. This also lends itself to the storytelling since it makes it difficult to tell who’s important and who isn’t until after the fact; there are no “disposable” characters in SAO. Only permanent death lurking from the towering, skeletal, insect-like lich or the bruiser with a hammer that anyone would want to avoid.The soundtrack is SAO’s other saving grace. Yuki Kajiura’s music in all of its English-Japanese-Latin-Hybrid glory doesn’t fail to deliver on the hopeless battles, the rising determination fights, and the stalemates between characters. Unfortunately, though good, it doesn’t manage to stand on its own. Very good music complements what it’s set to and would warrant wanting to listen to on its own. The music quality also doesn’t last throughout the show as there’s also an equal measure of forgettable synthesized tracks in the driest sense of the word. Ironically, one of the strongest scenes in the anime was one with absolutely no music at all; SAO’s soundtrack might have been better if it used the art of silence more since it demonstrates that it can use the lack of music effectively.The opening of the show, Crossing Field, is beautifully sung by Lisa but isn’t really a boon for the series in itself since strong openings aren’t unique to SAO. On the other hand, the lyrics do an excellent job at conveying one of the show’s greatest strengths in Kirito and Asuna’s relationship. And considering how uniquely everyone is designed, it makes it difficult to tell who’s important and who isn’t meaning anything can happen in a boss battle as Kajiura’s soundtrack plays throughout the fight. Unfortunately, the storytelling and character development problems down to Kirito himself might be too many glitches (flaws) for a game (show) as big as this. People who look too much into flaws may want to avoid this while those who can let themselves enjoy the experience for its strengths might be interested. For everyone who’s closer to measuring the strengths and weaknesses in equal measure, SAO will be a flawed but enjoyable experience.",3
sword-art-online,"First 13 episodes are beautifully constructed, dealing with thought-provoking situations and wonderfully done character development. It's filled breathtaking scenery, great action sequences, a sweet romance, and truly interesting villain. If they had left it at that it would have been a classic in my book, but they had to add on the last 13 episodes that, as a female reviewer, made me angry and uncomfortable. The villain was not interesting at all just creepy, plot line was pretty simplistic, and the portrayal of women (and their emotions) was just degrading. On the positive side though, the action was still pretty great and it had some great humor mixed in. I would still recommend this anime for anyone who loves action, dealing with complex issues, and some romance on the side. Overall, great watch!",4
sword-art-online,"When I watched the first episode of sword art online, i was shocked by how amazing this anime was, the storyline was just great. I just loved the episodes where they were in the world of sword art online. I went by those episodes at the speed of light since i liked them so much... But then came the world of alfheim online. I find that the creators didn't take the time to detail the world of alfheim and just rushed with kirito's main quest: save Asuna. Basically, all what happened in the world of alfheim was this: Kirito meets Leafa, Leafa informs kirito about the world tree, Kirito finds out that Asuna is up in the world tree and saves her. There wasn't anything else that was happening except that, and that's why I was disapointed because in the world of sword art online, ther was not only one main quest but also plenty of other subquest that kirito had to do, like helping the girl smith retrieve minerals for a sword or the girl that kirito met and he helped her get a flower for her pet. Anyways, this anime is very good and i recommend it to the people who love mmorpg's and action animes.",4
sword-art-online,"SPOILERS - THIS IS MY PERSONAL OPINIONA few ep's in and i sincerely fell in love with this anime. It was exciting and attention grasping. I enjoyed the character of the protagonist, i prefer the quiet cool type compared to the boisterous loud type. But what really made this work for me was the ability to die in a game; this added the much serious tone and emphasised the deaths of people within the game. They were no longer 'losers taking a game too seriously' but death meant death. the emotional scenes such as sachi's death were reinforced by this principle and gave depth to the scene. The fact everyone was working together to get out made sense, and clear logic flowed.I could even understand the antagonist, i mean, who wouldn't want to create a virtual world to become a god-like figure? (At the start i even found myself already making theories as to why he may have done this, finding myself taking big interest - one of my most interesting theories being it was all a lie, that no one actually died and he simply wanted to create the total gaming experience by making it seem real; and that all this media, newspapers and forced teleport was all a rouse). This also appealed to me as i do, if i don't say so myself, consider myself a romanticist. Asuna's character being a great match for Kirito. With heartwarming scenes of vicarious living in the forest, really did make me happy.However...... After episode 14 i was truly disappointed. I'm not sure if the author just ran out of ideas or someone else took over but everything fell off the rails. The story definately fell under its expectations that it had set up in the first arc. If they had ended it there, at episode 14, i would have given this anime 5*s, a definite. Lets talk about ALfheim. This realm being one where you cannot die. So straight away the imminent sense of danger is removed. What really angers me though is that it lost common sense; i myself, am an online gamer, WoW, LoL, Guild wars, you name it. But these people DEFINITELY take the game too seriously, you can't die so it just doesn't make sense as to how far people seem to take it seriously. This really angered me, how they took the best concept, the underlying principle that made the emotion scenes more deep and murdered it. Everything up to episode 22 seemed like a poor blur to me, the only highlight being a focus on the character development of his little sister which is the only emotional connection to the second arc i could see. Now surprisingly, i found Sugou to have a fitting character for an antagonist for the second arc, even though his appearance... well, he was a butterfly. His character being evil, maniacal and horny. The last fight was a disappointment, being shadowed by that of the first arc.I do, however, want a second series as i thoroughly enjoyed the first 14 episodes. I hope this anime will redeem itself as it shows it has the potential to be a classic 5*.NOTE:I would have much preferred it if they spent the whole 25 eps focusing on SOA instead of the poor second arc. The first was rushed IMO.",4.5
sword-art-online,"As an avid anime fan who has seen hundreds of anime, I can honestly say that this anime is one of the most memorable anime to have been released in the past few years. Everything about is is high quality. From the artwork to the voice acting to the animation, everything is well done. Many people have complained through their comments that the pacing of the first season (ep. 1-12)  is too fast, or that the the relationship between Kirito and Sugu, in season 2 (ep. 13-25) is incest. THESE ACCUSATIONS ARE NOT TRUE. I agree that the pacing or timing of the first season was fast, but it had to be because that's how it is in the light novel that the anime is based off of. Also the whole first season takes place over a period of 2 years, so seeing the day by day would have been boring.  The pacing of the second season is also good for the time period that that arc took place which was approximately a week. As for the incest issue, the relationship between Kirito and Sugu isn't that. Incest as you all know implies a sexual relationship between two family members, but there is none of that going on between those two. It is simply shown as Sugu having a crush on her cousin and nothing other than that is implied. That aside I'd like to finish by mentioning that I personally believe that this anime will continue to endeavor and survive the years to become a classic anime that defines this decade and it's genre.",4.5
sword-art-online,"Sword Art Online seemed really cool to me in the beginning. I loved the art style, the animation was gorgeous, and the music really fit the show. For the first five or six episodes I was really into it, eagerly awaiting each new release at the end of the week. It was an intense show with an interesting premise that I enjoyed watching. I didn't really care much for the main two characters (Asuna and Kirito), but in the end it didn't matter because the rest of the show and characters were enough to hold me over.However, about the time the show started focusing more on the relationship between Kirito and Asuna, the show started to take a turn for the worse. By the end of the first half of the anime, Asuna went from a strong, capable leader to a whiny, dependent girl who could barely take care of herself. When Kirito was going to go off to fight a boss without her, she clung desperately to him, whining about how if he died she'd kill herself, and blah blah blah. Way to destroy her character completely, guys.Kirito went from somewhat interesting to... well, somewhat interesting, I guess. He barely changed throughout the show. Little character development and a bland personality a good character does not make. But the real breaking point for me was episode 14. The show then proceeds to completely break all its pre-established rules (for no reason, might I add. Kirito is killed, yet somehow wills himself back to life to beat the final boss? I don't think so. Asuna magically overcomes paralysis to save Kirito from dying, with absolutely no explanation? Ugh.). After that, the show just isn't worth watching. The plot for the second half of the show is generic and mediocre at best, and with characters you can't even really like, there's little worth coming back for. Asuna does nothing but mope and cry, Kirito spends half his time messing around and the other half of it like, ""I MUST SAVE ASUNA!!!1!11!"" so there's never any real sense of urgency. Sugu is a decent character, but the show does nothing but slap her around every episode and it's really hard to watch.Overall, I would not recommend this show to anyone. It started out so good but ultimately failed to live up to the hype.",3
sword-art-online,"This anime is practically the best and most entertaining anime that thousands or maybe millions of people are enjoying each time a new episode is out and funny moments happening. Also i have to say the romance part is practically the ""second"" best part about this anime so far (Action is #1). if this is an on-going anime (EXTREMELY HOPING IT IS!) then many people will be extremely happy (MOSTLY ME OF COURSE!!   ^'O'^).",3
sword-art-online,"Looking back on it, Sword Art Online was the only decent show to come out of Summer 2012. The premise is pretty base and the writing is sub-par, yet it has some good execution with a well done score from Yuki Kajiura and pretty good animation. After episode 14 though, where the Aincrad arc ends and the Alfheim arc begins, the series completely jumps the shark and the writing becomes ridiculous. The first 14 episodes are ok, but after that point the rest of the series just gets dumb. Not to mention the fanbase of this show is just as annoying as Narutards. Overall, this series isn't really worth watching.For a more in depth review of this series, watch Digibro's video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uON7ANNOi4",5
sword-art-online,"The first half of Sword Art Online is captivating with interesting characters and a fast paced enjoyable plot but near the 15 episode mark it goes from Shounen (for boys) to Shoujo (for girls) Still good, just not for me.Good Points- Good gaming humor- Unconventional characters (at first)- Interesting scenarios and environmentsBad Points- Demographic change- Characters become generic (eventually)- Minor plot holes",4
sword-art-online,"Ok, yes this show has 101 problems in terms of the plot, and the story does go a bit downhill in the second half, but none of this really bothered me. The show is just very entertaining, and if you want a good fun watch, look no furtherThe animation looks great, the action and soundtrack are good, and whether the plot was any good or not, I was just enjoying the ride. A second season would not go amiss.",3
sword-art-online,"The first half of SAO was pretty good. Was a bit disappointed that so many character just got dropped and forgotten after one episode and I definitely had a problem with the pacing of the show. That said though, the show still held pretty nicely, what with the animation and a few gem episodes with interesting concepts, and i enjoyed myself a very good amount.Then the second half happened.. just. it just was not gooood",4
sword-art-online,"To be completely truthful i went in this anime wary due to the controversy surrounding this show. I was surprised to end up liking it with it's awesome battles and good writing. I mean i'd notice the characters being a little flat but it is a classic shouen type anime so not that big of a problem. I really started to like this anime, it wasn't masterpiece material like Gankutsuo or Code Geass but it was up there with the likes of Black Butler and Ouran. Then came the second story arc that just plainly failed to deliver. I mean i know it wouldn't be true to the its roots but if it ended at episode 14 it would have been amazing. Though this aside it is a decent anime that deserves to be watched.",4
sword-art-online,"I spent the majority of this series with my mouth agape, my butt at the edge of my seat, and my eyes filled to the brim with tears. I'm usually very critical about action series that seemingly plug a romantic storyline in so it has unisex appeal, but every relationship and character interaction in SAO was as natural as reality itself. Not a single part of this series seemed repetitive, over done, or contrived. I can confidently say that out of all series I've seen up until now, Sword Art Online is the closest to absolute perfection. Brava!",4.5
sword-art-online,"Sword Art Online had been named anime of 2012 by multiple review sites including this site. Is it? Well, let's just say that 2012 isn't the best year of animes.Plot: 7/10Too low for you? The plot of SAO is about thousands of players being trapped in a virtual reality mmorpg. The only way out is for someone to clear the game. With 14 episodes for the first story arc of the anime, it felt rushed. Audiences weren't given the time to explored every side of Aincrad (the floating city in SAO). Lots of in-game mechanics aren't really explained. But lets look at the good side, SAO's plot is still worth the watch. People in the game don't have any reason to finish it other than to live. A fight for your life. There are episodes featuring how the game changes people. But people exploding into pixels make deaths less dramatic.Characters: 7/10The anime is all about Kirito and Asuna. And no one else. The weakest point of the anime is its poor minor characters. They get 1 episode and you never really get to see them much. This makes the world of SAO feel small. Kirito is a really cool guy. Unlike most protagonists, he is a badass from the start, due to being a beta-tester of SAO. He's known to solo bosses. I say again, he's a badass. Asuna is also a powerful player with a much likeable attitude. But I would consider her ""a generic female lead"" since there's nothing really special about her.The romance between the two is a good change of pace. It didn't take them long to confess their feelings and get married (in-game). They aren't shy to show their love for each other. Though sometimes, they talk too mature for their age. ""I want to be with you forever"" and all that stuff.There's really no unique or interesting character hereAnimation: 10/10Animation is flawless here. The fight scenes are amazing. There's nothing one can complain about the animation. It's really goodSummaryAfter watching the first arc of the story, I was disappointed. This anime is extremely overrated and I wouldn't dare call it the best anime I've seen. But it's still worth your time. Though if you're looking for a story with deep and well-developed characters, this ain't the anime for you. Towards the end, the was anime no longer about Kirito and Asuna alone. But I say again, minor characters and villains are as plain as paper here. I hope I didn't shoo you off the anime. I only wanted to tell how I felt with my years of Otakuness. The anime is still one of the best of 2012. Other people may call the story engaging but I've seen what engaging truly means.Marked: Overrated",4.5
sword-art-online,"Sword Art Online is a very good Anime. The Characters are amazing and totally believable. I thought that the way the story moved was a bit fast in the First story arc, because  i would of like to see more buildup of the relationship of Asuna and Kirito and more of the life after they were married. And the 2nd arc was Just as good as the first one was. All in all a very  good anime and HIGHLY recommend that you watch this one!",4
sword-art-online,"I've been putting off watching this anime in the thought that it will probably be your average RPG anime. They get stuck in this world and to be able to escape, they need to defeat the big boss. Of course in the end they probably survive and defeat the boss as they all do. Happy ending. The end.On second thoughts, scratch that. I know it does sound really cliché and you've probably watched like, 100 other animes like this.Trust me, you couldn't have been more wrong. This is a must see anime that puts you on a roller coaster of emotions. It's not always the whole fight scene but it's more than that. You get comedy from the funny scenes and of course the romance between Kirito and Asuna. You are taken through the tragedies and deaths that Kirito experiences which makes him and his will to live for those people stronger. And the obvious, the fight scenes which are very well presented with the really good graphics and sounds! You feel all those and more! Sometimes I feel like I am him and I'm experiencing what he's experiencing. Much like I am in the game.I would suggest watching it from start to finish in a dark room somewhere eating pop corn and all your favourite foods with the sounds turned up really loud. Now that's the definition of heaven.",5
sword-art-online,"Sword Art Online is really just a story about a very mary-sueish character named Kirito, following his adventure as he gets trapped into an online world. The world of Sword Art Online is rather interesting, and has a plethora of wonderful and unique mechanics that take a back seat to the relationships that Kirito builds with a bunch of random female players, eventually settling on the cliche ""independent women"" Asuna. While it tries to build suspense with the 'if you die in the game you die IRL' this soon grows old due to it's lackluster presentation of the characters grinding to take on the next boss, only to have half of them die in one hit. Had Sword Art Online focused on more than two of it's characters and delved more into it's hastily discarded concepts, it could have proven a real winner.",4
sword-art-online,"Being a man of music, I'm gonna go ahead and give my opinion of some of the music. The opening and ending of season 1 were very cool to watch and had some cool music by Lisa (who did the opening to one of my favorite shows, Fate/Zero). In the show, whoever wrote the music did not lack from creativity so I think the music in general was handled very well. The I feel the same way about the art style. Almost all of my grievances come from season 2.  Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideI personally think the show should've ended after episode 14 when Kirito wakes up. That would've made for a fantastic and non-traditional ending. However, they decided to let the show go on. Season 1 was very good, simple show to watch given that each episode was pretty much self-contained. I really enjoyed the simpleness of it, everything from the kinda cool fight scenes to the romance. But then season 2 came around it's just gradually gotten worse and worse to the point where I'm not sure I want to continue watching it anymore.  Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideThe whole thing with the love interest with brother and ""sister"" is just too weird for me and then almost having tentacle porn happen right in my face did not win any favors with me. I believe there is still hope for this show, but it is slim and fading.For those of you saying that this has the action of Bleach, the intelligence of Death Note, and other stuff like, I humbly disagree. If you want action, go watch Fate/Zero. If you want intelligence and intricacies, go watch Baccano! (yes, it is spelt with the exclamation point). If you want plot twists and good character development, watch Guilty Crown. For those who might be reading and haven't started yet, I encourage you to only watch the first 14 episodes, at least until they have a few more than the current 22 episodes up (I don't know how long this show will last anyways). So pretty much the only reason I'm giving this a 3/5 is because of season 1",2
sword-art-online,"Though I have never read the manga, I will give a review as to my interpretation on the anime.I am thoroughly enjoying the story of our main heroes with a tragic love story, even though love triangles have bothered me very much in the past, at least two of them are in meaningful love. It is also a new take as far as I know of, to have two triangles with the main couple only trying to get to a point were life can continue peacefully for them.I absolutely love the 'baby' of the two lovers and feel that it was brought into the story at an appropriate time and was strange but even the two 'parents' were understandably confused and handled it as such believable actions that understandably make the most sense to them at the time.Everyone whom I know offline and online that have played MMORPGs with me speaks of their time online was real and often times more enjoyable than a real day on auto-pilot and this portrayed the experience accurately from the perspective of someone who has played MMORPGs obsessively as portrayed in the series.",5
sword-art-online,"I must say this is one of the most interesting animes i have ever watched , the story is amazing and addicting. (cant wait for another episode this weekend) The characters is well thought out and you will not be dissapionted if you watch this anime.Shame that the Season 1 ""Sword art online"" is only 14 episodes , they could probably have made over 100 episodes with all the boss fights and such. Im not sure if this is a good thing or bad thing tho. Dont want the show to go on and on without anything happening. ;)Edit : Also Season 1 > Season 2 by far ;p",5
sword-art-online,"Since this series hasn't officially ended I cannot properly assess an accurate score or review, however, I will give my first impressions and thoughts on this series. (Up to Episode 20)[Genre & Audience]Sword Art Online (SOA) starts off as an adventure/fantasy based anime. This changes later on though, as the story gears towards a more romantic story. I have to say that the romance really plays a great deal in the overall story (up to what we have seen) and it will probably stay that way. Here and there action sequences are added in order to ""spice"" things up and provide more variety, but in the end, the main focus is romance.  [Plot] Digging beneath the overall plot and romance, we find a very generic and predictable story. There are many scenes that audiences could easily foreshadow and predict, thus making this a very generic anime. The plot is not unique in the way that it is not something we've never seen before. However, this is not entirely a bad thing. Those who really enjoy romance and deep character development will come to love this series. The entire experience of Sword Art Online, is being able to relate with the characters and living through them. Around halfway through the plot, there is an interesting twist that really strengthens the story's focus and characters.[Characters]In the beginning episodes, I found that the character development was not really strong as I felt somewhat cheated when they often introduced 1 or 2 new characters, had them bond way too fast, then killed them off all in 1 episode. This problem was resolved in later episodes, when the anime had finally established its main characters and focus. A definite plus happens near the halfway point of the series when the character development really starts to solidify and entrance the emotions of its viewers. As I am a hopeless romantic, I found myself enchanted by the character dialogue and many of the settings where they took place. I felt like I could somewhat relate to some of the characters and the hardships they were going through (not to mention the well put together romantic episodes). Midway through the series is also when an unexpected twist changes the story heavily and throws its audience off balance (it mind boggled me). This is where the anime starts to truly shine in its use of character development. It is that point where the main character is faced with a difficult dilemma but refuses to give up. The hardships that he endures sparked empathy in me that brought me to tears.  [Art & Animation] The art itself is gorgeous, and the fight scenes are rather well put together. There is a lot of detail put into the animation which brings the story to life. Although the story line is considered a bit generic and predictable, the environment and settings are definitely not. The farther I got into the series, the farther I felt myself trapped in this world of beauty. Constant happiness and freedom seems to linger around the game world, and it gives one a sense of relief and liberation. It begs the question to its viewers: whether a happy dream is better than a dull reality?[Conclusion & Personal Thoughts]I definitely had a lot of fun with this series with its top notch characters and innovative setting and design. Even though I've been stressing how the story is ""very predictable"" I still love this anime to pieces. I find myself very attached to the main characters and often find myself having the same emotional reactions as them in certain scenes. Thus when the sudden twist happened, I felt my heart shattering to pieces; I had never felt so vulnerable, and definitely not from an anime. Not only does this anime have a great love story to tell, it really brings out the emotions of the audience. I definitely recommend it to any adventurers out there, fond of a basic generic hero, and a loving for a sweet, and charming love story! I just can't wait to see how the story turns out!",2
sword-art-online,"Plot was great at first. From watching the first episode I really saw potential in this show and really thought it would be a very promising adaption series, unfortunately that impression didn't stand for very long. Episode by episode it became really hard to grasp the original plot in this series, The unnecessary fillers, fan service, and unbelievably fast phase of it all left me with a headache every time. Really though, screw all the action, lets make Asuna and Kirito play Husband and Wife for the next three episodes.(: The main characters identify perfection. Kirito is a beater whose masculinity cannot be touched by anyone mortal, every single girl digs him -- yes, even his own cousin, and also gets a special ability not given to any other player because he is just that great.  Asuna is a  Babe with the cooking skills of a housewife, money, and beauty, making Kirito look even more of a badass than he's already set out to be. So perf, you guys. (: Side characters barely got enough showtime and may never come up in the series again, sad to say. For the Pros though... the animation is great, and the music was highly enjoyable. Overall, this show gets a  3 from my perspective. I know I skipped a few things in this review, but I wanted to make this short and almost brief. This anime could have been so, SO much more, but unfortunately fell a victim of the glamorization of fan-service that is the anime industry today. Hell, It would have been my favorite show of all time if it wasn't for all this.",3
sword-art-online,"If you loved .hack you're going to love Sword Art Online. The concept of, ""you die in the game you die in real life"" has never been done well, and SAO has done it justice. The Raw emotion and intensity displayed by the characters is amazing, and the episodes always leave you wanting to watch more, after watching just one episode I was hooked and could not stop, I literally sat down and watched all 17 current episodes in one day. Don't listen to the random hater reviews, some people just can't grasp great quality anime when it is given to them.",3
sword-art-online,"I'm saying this right now SAO is without a doubt my favourite show this year and that includes all forms of media not just anime. Story The story is well paced, and told through the eyes of Kirito a player in the world of Sword Art Online known as a beater a gamer who was lucky enough to be part of the 1000 beta players and thus knows all the secrets and best quests, Kirito is at first a Solo player who helps the front line when the reach a powerful level boss. The story is just wonderful! it's engrossing and keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering what will happen next. Characters What can i say about the characters in SAO? They are amazing well written and wonderful. You want them to succeed and you grow to love each one individual. Conclusion SAO is best show I've watched this year and the best Anime i've watched in a long long time, I look forward too a new episode every week and it has yet too disappoint me, new comers may find the first few episodes slow but once you get through those i think it becomes a show that will live in your mind days after your done with each episode.",3
sword-art-online,Best show I have seen in a very long time. At first i thought it was going to be like the .hack series but wow this show exceeded my expectations. The characters are well rounded so it feels like you know then even though we know very little about them. Asuna and Kiritos relationship is perfect the two are made for each other the relationship in the anime feels a little rushed and forced compared to the light novels but does not affect the show in anyway. Any fan of MMOs well feel at home with the setting of this show it puts a great detail into what a game would look and feel like. Overall I must say that this is now one of my top 3 must watch,4.5
sword-art-online,"I love romance anime, I also enjoy anime filled with action. That being said SAO manages to balance both wonderfully where most focus on one or the other.The romance side of SAO is very refreshing, as opposed to most anime where the entire show is based of trying to understand what the relationship is, SAO has no misunderstandings about Kirito's and Asuna's love for one another. Instead it focuses on the obstacles they must overcome to stay together which to me is is more romantic in context.Overall I feel it is the best new show of the season and is a definite must see.",4.5
sword-art-online,"It's been a few years since I've been so absorbed into a series, and Sword Art Online really has reeled me in something shocking. From the seamless animation to the beautiful landscapes, nail biting fight scenes to the unforgettable characters, this series really has the lot. Sure, it has a few flaws and annoying instances (I'll get to those later), but when you're given a packages as incredible as this, those annoyances will be forgotten before you even think about questioning it.Sword Art Online (SAO) is set in a breathtaking cyber world that is created as a revolutionary MMO where players are fully immersed by means of a helmet that transmits all their senses and nerve signals to the game. On launch day, things quickly take a sinister turn when the game creator tells players that they are stuck in the game and death ingame would be permanent, both ingame and in real life. Their only salvation is to make it through all 100 floors of the tower, by which they would complete the game and they would be set free. The story mainly follows the relationship between Kirito, a shy and slightly reclusive boy, and Asuna, a determined and strong willed girl who are brought closer throughout the show.Setting/storyline: 9.5/10As an avid gamer myself, I dream of a time when fully integrated gameplay is introduced, and this gets my hopes up even more. The ultimate escapism to this vibrant and dynamic world just makes me wish I was there, even if it is just to sit on a hill watching the sun set. The contrast between this an the ominous corridors of the tower really work well to show two very different and potentially dangerous sides to this utopia. The storyline also paces itself very well, not feeling rushed and hurried, but still fast enough not to leave you feeling bored. There are some genuinely surprising twists in the story that are always a welcome addition. I feel perhaps they could have delved a little deeper, but SAO does a good job showing human psychology when put under strain by fear of death, opportunities for power and wealth and freedom to make your own decisions without the fear of the consequences. More times than I am comfortable to admit, I felt tears welling up at the more emotional scenes, and they sure do throw them in quite often and understandably a good handful nearer the end. ******POSSIBLE SPOILER******Having watched up to episode 15, I am majorly impressed that they have gone on to show the aftermath of the main story. Too often, the aftermath is overlooked and is just something that they almost feel obliged to put in just to leave us viewers satisfied that everything did turn out ok, the boy did get the girl and they lived happily ever after. But I feel that the transition from a magical, almost idealistic world, to the harsh realities and politics of society can be just as interesting, if not more, than the main plot. So far so good, fingers crossed!Also, when a hand gets cut off and that said hand disappears and that character is missing a hand for a good while, said hand should not grow back. I was expecting that to be an ironic twist so soon after he revealed his special ability!******END OF SPOILERS*******Characters: 9.5/10And unforgettable cast is paramount in an unforgettable experience, and SAO does this fantastically. Even more minor characters are given enough time to develop and really make an impression or surprise us. The main protagonist suffers from your usual cliches, being overly depressed, completely oblivious to most girls feelings and self loathing, but thankfully before these start becoming a major annoyance, he turns into a complete utter BADASS. Kirito is, for the most part, a lone wolf that is equally feared, respected and hated for his incredible skills and these skills play a major part in a lot of SAO's awesome fight scenes.I'm not usually a fan of straight up romance, preferring rather to choose between a group of love interests, but Kirito's and Asuna's relationship is one of the best I've ever seen. Sure, there is your usual dilly dallying around the topic for a while, but once it properly blossoms, their selfless love for each other really is quite touching and beautiful. I genuinely felt attached to many of the characters in SAO, and really felt emotional when some of them inevitably died/disappeared. Artwork/animation:10/10Epic fights, breathtaking landscapes, great clothing/weapon design and an incredibly attractive cast. What else can you ask for?Overall: 9.7/10SAO is easily making it to my favorite animes of all time. Nothings perfect, but this sure does put up a fair fight. An excellently polished piece of work with a great story and cast all wrapped up in a beautiful world. If this continues at the standard it has kept up throughout, I'll be a happy man.(Also, Sachi. Goddammit Sachi!)",3
sword-art-online,"When I saw the cover art for SAO I was a bit excited first as it seemed to be game related and as I was watching this I was hooked from the start. The storyline is breathtaking even for a ""light novel"" I really wish to see this kind of future right now while I'm still young and to experience this is almost every gamers' dream to be able to play the game your way not by the buttons programmed to attack or defend but your own ""Initial Input"" as Kirito states. I have been researching this kind of gameplay the dream is possible but it would require that more research would have to be put into studying on how to incorporate the brain to machines as ""NerveGear"" Shows us. Most people may not wish for a life and death situation like this but this kind of experience may be how most gamers may want to die, ""Playing"". In the end for the first season of SAO I give this a perfect 5 star and I know it is with its story, wonderful music, the little romance and a little fan service doesn't hurt but I really enjoy the story as this may inspire more minds like myself who would want to stop playing the games of this era and continue towards this future so that while we are still young, may enjoy this to the best of our ability.I am currently undergoing research into Virtual Reality and as much progress into gaming has grown we have yet to focus on the brain sure the technology we have is quite enough to make it but we need to create a language that is compatible with the brain's vast amount of electrical pulses. Further more later",5
sword-art-online,"Sword Art Online or SAO is a great story about a boy named Kirito who buys this virtual reality game that just came out, but a really messed up twist of fait has him as well as the 14,000 or so other people who logged into the game trapped inside the world of SAO. Now stuck in a life or death battle its either clear the game and send everyone back to the real world or die trying with the help of Asuna and some other friends, Everyone just might get to see the real world again or will it be....GAME OVERWith great art and animation Sword Art Online is a great anime you should really watch. The fact that this could really happen just might make you rethink buying a virtual reality game in the future (just sayin)",3
sword-art-online,"This is an amazing show that really appeals to the MMORPG players out there. It is well thought out with a fantastic story. It's filled with romance, suspense, comedy, action, and all within the context being a MMORPG. The main characters are not all the same and each have their own personalities, psychological obstacles, preferences, and abilities. The show really shines in the fact it has RPG references throughout thus grounding the anime and characters to facts, knowledge, and lore that even casual gamers can understand. That is why I give it a 5/5 and cannot wait to see where season 2 is heading.",5
sword-art-online,"This anime has a delectable taste to it for gamers and for people who love the whole action drama type of animes.  this anime most people say, that the game should become real. they would get rich off of this game if it were to become a game. thats how good the anime is. its so good it leaves u wanting 2nds, 3rds and 4ths of this dinner and dessert.. Sword art online has a great aura around it.. i give sword art online 5 stars out of 5",5
sword-art-online,"Just by the name of the anime i thought it was going to be about learning how to draw swords or something. Then i found out it was a anime, the cover looked good so i watched it. If you are into suspense,love story,action,and comedy (only a little)  then this is a anime for you. Its just plan out AMAZING. It will make you cry,and jump for joy and even make you want to go into the anime and punch some of those (female dogs). Well if you LOVE anime with a passion you'll fan girl a lot then.Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideI CANT WAIT FOR THE THE 2nd SEASON (yes there will be a 2nd season)",5
sword-art-online,"I'll start my review by saying this is one the greatest anime I have ever seen, and I don't say that very often ^^It can be hard to find and series that combines so neatly the genres of romance, action, and fantasy these days, but Sword Art Online manages to do the task almost perfectly, maybe one of the best points of this anime is how nicely the characters ( not only the main ones) are built ( and I m not talking about character development, that's is rather lacking here ) most people can relate to at least two of them and you can almost feel what they are feeling, the drama and action are smart, very entertaining  and intense, but I think that the major aspect here is the romance, I could only compare to Bokura Ga Ita's, and that's really ( besides all the rest ) why I LOVE this anime so much, YOU CAN'T MISS IT :)!!(I did't mention the bad points because I feel they are overshadowed by the positive facts of it)",2
sword-art-online,"After watching 3 episodes of Sword Art Online (SAO) I finally decided to make a review for it.This anime draws you into the messy world of MMOs. It is impressive that each episode makes the anime realistic compared to MMOs being played right now. When a person plays MMO, the game won't stop every player who's been there way before you just to notify that YOU are gonna be amazing or be the strongest person in the server. People don't stand out in the game just by standing there and not even introducing yourself to anyone (for the guy who reviewed this anime poorly... you need to get real and not expect the most cliche types of anime where the player is just too damn strong compared to everyone)If you start watching this anime, the thing that might bother you the most is the big time leaps in each episode. This is actually something that makes the anime better and more realistic. If you play MMO, most of the times you just grind or do boring quests daily. Each episode shows you the more interesting parts of an MMO and also a story that shows the characteristics of the protagonist and how he is shaped into another person after meeting people during the gameThis anime is really good and playing an MMO gives more appeal to this show because of the nostalgic system, begginer's stage, etc. This series is something worth watching that wont actually let you down in each episode (well of course, I'm only saying this to the current episodes)",3
sword-art-online,"First things first-Read the Light Novel, it is amazing.Secondly, right off the bat, the plot of SAO had me hooked. I cannot even count the numerous times I dream't of being in a VRMMORPG (Virtual Reality Massive Multiplayer Role-Playing Game) it would certainly be the end of my life-But at the same time create a entirely different one.Although the situation these characters have to endure would not to be exactly preferable..If you have ever played a MMO, you'll find yourself feeling the bitter sweet nostalgic memories of your past game time. You'll be able to relate to almost everything and with that connect to the world almost instantly.If you haven't played an MMO.. well, shucks you really aught to.That is about all I'll say for now. Perhaps i'll write another review when the show is finished so I squeal and blubber about it like a tiny little fan girl. Till then my friends.Trah-la-la.",5
sword-art-online,"Sword Art Online is an anime based off of a series of Light Novels by the same author who wrote the Light Novels for Accel World.  Taking place in a world where the inhabitants are trapped within a game by the game's creator and where death within the game becomes death in reality, the citizens of the world must fight through the 100 floors of the world in order to log out.Thus far, the quality of the art and sound seems fairly typical.  Thus, what brings this series to life is the story.   Many will liken this to .hack and in many ways, there are similarities, but there are also subtle differences even within those.  As examples:Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hide all players trapped in the world and unable to log out similar to what happens in GU..  However, unlike GU where dying would only make you fall into a coma, in SAO you actually die.  Like in .hack, there are PKs and people aiming to stop them; however, unlike .hack, PKing and stopping PKs is a matter of life and death where failure to stop the PKs will literally result in countless deaths..However, the story is not about the similarities and while .hack focuses much more on certain aspects such as a mysterious being with great powers, Sword Art Online is much more focused on the relationships between the players and a few major battles.  The key basis behind the story of Sword Art Online is that death is final.  How people resolve that becomes a major and important part of the story.Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hidePretty much anything can kill you.  Other players, people outside trying to remove the gear from you, monsters, and there is even a story arc revolving around PKs managing to circumvent the towns' anti-pk protection.But perhaps this review is a little unfair.  Nothing could possibly compare to actually watching it yourself.  Watch the anime for an episode or two.  Maybe even pick up the manga or light novel.  I'd recommend checking out at least the first few episodes/chapters before deciding.   This series is more than worth the time.",4.5
sword-art-online,"I would rate the SAO arc with 5 stars and the ALO arc with 3 stars if I could. However, this is a review for the overall anime. The good: 1. Excellent soundtrack and animation. The show has a great aesthetic. 2. Strong, interesting, and engaging premise for the story. 3. Fun and interesting characters. The antagonists do a great job. The not-so-good: 1. ""Harem"" Elements: The godly Kirito is loved by all females. This honestly doesn't add to the show, and arguably takes away from it. Given that this show also takes place in an MMO, SAO can be perceived as a ""teenager's fantasy"" in more ways than one. 2. Asuna's personality does a 180: She's introduced as being strong and independent, but becomes dependent and submissive once she falls in love with Kirito. 3. Suguha's  Incestual Desires: I'll call it incest because cousin-cousin relationships are considered as such in several cultures, and because Kirito and Suguha were raised as siblings and he always considered her as such. It's bad because it attempts to add romantic elements to the ALO arc despite the fact that (i) Kirito already has Asuna and (ii) the ultimate goal of the arc is to save Asuna from a disgusting pervert. This element of the show almost contradicts everything around it. 4. Underwhelming Plot, Gives into Romance: This anime had a great premise for a captivating action and adventure story. However, it almost fails to meet such expectations by putting a large emphasis on romance and fanservice. This show would have been more powerful if it maintained a focused theme. An issue that I have with this show is that it's like a ""stealth romance."" It puts a larger emphasis on romance than on action, but the given genres do not reflect such. Kirito doesn't look good as a ""player"" or a ""manwhore"" like Narukami from Persona 4 the Animation, in which the characters can actually joke about it. The ALO arc, despite its great fight scenes, includes more fanservice and romance than the SAO arc. Ironic considering how Asuna was locked away.",4.5
sword-art-online,"I started watching SAO without reading the short story or manga, and I got into it right away from the first episode. The concept is really interesting, the artwork was AMAZING. But some parts of the show, I would get confused because:1) there's plotholes2) something is not explained, and you'd have to know the original story or read the comments to understand3) it's really ... unbelievable at partsOverall, if you want to get into it, read the short story first then come to appreciate the anime for it's amazing artwork.",5
sword-art-online,"Honestly, this anime is my favorite ever (not saying much though because I'm kinda new to anime).  I know that if you look at it critically, it's actually not that good, but in terms of pure enjoyment, it's at the top of my list.  I loved all the action and fights that they put in.  All the fights were excellently executed and had amazing art.  The romance is really what made me enjoy it so much (I'm kinda a sap for romance, even cheesy stuff like this ^.^).  Anyways, great anime.",5
sword-art-online,"I have to say SAO is the best anime i have seen in a long time and i mean it. It blew my standards away, now when i see another show on i roll my eyes because i know that there nowhere near what u have accomplished with SAO. But i do hope however that u can go more in-depth this go round like how the story is in what u wrote make the series longer than 25 episodes because u could easily make it a 50-100 episode series and do fine i mean there is enough info to do that also maybe come back around and fill in some stuff with Aincrad and in Alfheim. Also if and when u do it maybe consider making a longer series with Gun Gale and UnderWorld. Hope my advice is good and is not takin bad in any way shape or form only giving u my 2 cents in hope of a SEASON 3 and 4 and on and on if u know what i mean, if u like my ideas please use them all i ask in return is for 1 word to be posted and that is a YES then i will know and be super happy =D",3
sword-art-online,"My favorite part about this anime would have to be the concept. I like video games, so I was drawn to the plot, where characters are trapped inside an MMO. The characters were fun to watch as well. It was enjoyable to see Kirito and Asuna bond closer as the anime progresses. However, I thought the anime progressed too quickly during the SAO portion. It would have been nice to see more of Kirito's progress from a level 1 to a high-leveled character. Still, I would definitely recommend this anime to fans of MMOs and video games.",5
sword-art-online,"I loved sword art online, it was really great.when a friend recommended it-I was like ""its gonna be spy kids 3 all over again"" But it turned out to be realy goodHowever: people reading reviews don’t want to hear another person fawning over the show, so I will tell you a few things. Not ‘problems’ just things I noticedI actually really loved it.*spoiler alert*(I don't tell the ending or anything but...) 1)The show was a little to fast- i.e. You never get a sense of everyday live in SAO, Its fine for ALO because there in no need to wait- in SAO the floors have to clear one at a time so the characters have to live in between. (Maybe I’m just used to western style cartoons, which have no overreaching plot) In ALO it’s fine because the world tree is right there. 2)All the female characters fall for Kirito: it’s a little overdone*You proved your point two characters ago*Sachi didn’t last long-It was weird…not judging-just sayingI did like how the one girl who didn’t fall for him immediately was the one he fell for. 3)Asuna was really fierce in SAO and then became a damsel in distress in ALOIt was just strange that her character changed so dramatically. 3)Sugu/Lyfa didn’t know kirito (Kazuto?) it was a little strangeI liked the way the villain was- kayaba was the villain but he wasn’t evilIt worked really well -and you get an evil villain in ALO to satisfy all your evil villain needs.The Asuna-Kirito love story was really well workedThe art was goodThe music was greatSecondary characters were well worked outI didn’t understand all the settings but-then again- It’s a video gameYui!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! -‘nuff said-The theme (the character and the player are the same-virtual reality is just an extension of reality) is well-worked and thought out…thought provokingOn the wholeA really wonderful animeFive stars*****",5
sword-art-online,"This anime surprised me. I didn't think it was going to be that good. I really enjoyed watching it. It included romance and action all at the same time. I suggest watching this, Sword Art Online is an amazing anime. When you start watching this anime you will become addicted until you finish all the episodes. Loved it. Although i wasn't very surprised by the ending because it was very obvious what was going to happen but in the end i really just loved it!",5
sword-art-online,"Sword Art Online was one of the few animes that really got to me...Kirito and Asuna are basically the main characters of the story, the whole situation is that our characters here are stuck in an MMORPG called Sword Art Online. But in this game if you die in the game you die in real life. To get out of the game they must reach the 100th floor and defeat the boss. There are a lot of sad and touching moments in this anime, which I for one am a sucker for.One thing for sure, where there is a good story there are bound to be evil villians... all of which really PISSED me off... quite literally...Anyways I highly recommend this anime to those who haven't seen it and are interested in action based (or shounen) animes. ENJOY!Season two is good and Season three has yet to be announced (continuation of Season two ending following the World Seed)  Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hide",5
sword-art-online,"This is going to be an anime that grabs you with the story telling and character development. I'm going to try and write this without spoiling anything. The plot is amazing, but the thing that immediately caught me was the love story. The first half in my opinion was the best. You could watch episodes 1-14 and just be happy with it but I suggest watching all 25 for the full effect. The only flaw I can point out is there isn't enough episodes of SAO (I mean the game). They crammed so much time into only 14 episodes. I would have loved to see more episodes of from the first game. All in all I give this anime a 5/5. If you play MMORPG's or even video games in general than I can almost guarantee satisfaction and enjoyment from this show.",5
naruto-shippuden,"This anime has great canon. Since it is based on the manga, the story in itself is great. HOWEVER, most of this anime is filler. When you think you're getting to a climax in a storyline... you get 15 filler episodes. EVERY. DAMN. SEASON. The manga is now over. THEY CAN BRING THE SHOW TO A CONCLUSION. They won't however. Instead, they greatly degrade the quality of a once good anime with almost completely unwatchable filler storylines. In fact, there is soo much filler, after waiting month after month after month for the actual canon (the reason for this anime), I've completely withdrawn from the story to the point where I simply don't care and have to rewatch episodes from 3 months ago to remember wtf is going on. The anime company destroyed what could have been the greatest anime in existence. Like spray painting a stickman body on the Mona Lisa to make it a larger picture. Empty, useless, boring episodes usually follow a good canon episode and after almost a decade of this pattern I must say, read the manga instead. It is way better and won't disappoint since (again) the story really is one of the best. I'm sad to see Naruto end, but happy as well, since the longer fillers continue (even at the end), the more of a ""milking the cow"" scenario this becomes.",4.5
naruto-shippuden,"I started watching Naruto back in 2003.I'm now in 2014 and still watching! I grew up on it and it really does teach great values in it's story and the character development. Naruto single handedly brought me into all the other anime, such as Bleach, Death Note, InuYasha, etc. The story is truly original and so in depth it'll surprise you how far it goes. Naruto turns from punk to protector of his village throughout the years this show has been going on. This anime has it all: Romance, Action (OF COURSE), Great fighting scenes too, music is top notch and so are the voice overs. It's truly been an amazing ride and I will definitely miss it when it's gone, but it's gotta end sometime. To anyone new to this series: Get into it ASAP, you won't regret it!",3
naruto-shippuden,"If you have never read this Manga or watched this Anime i recommend you stop reading reviews and get to watching because you are definitely missing out.Ive been watching Naruto since i was 8. As i kid i saw it as more of a humorous funny anime but as i got older and Shippuden came out i got to experience the depth of the Naruto Mange and Anime. Naruto Shippuden puts all the pieces together of every story line so well it keeps you in, as i did me....i would say until it ended (Chapter 700 came out 2 weeks ago) But Naruto:The last is said to come to theaters in Japan on 12/6/14 and im beyond excited about that. Even after Naruto:The last comes out i will always come back to re-read and re-watch Naruto and Naruto shippuden, I am a mother now and introduced my daughter to the series as soon as she started paying attention to the content in TV shows. We watch it everynight together. And when shes old enough to read ill be handing down my Naruto and Naruto Shippuden Manga to her to enjoy as i did. Naruto and Naruto Shippuden has been a huge part of most of my life and i just cant see myself walking away probably ever.",5
naruto-shippuden,"Usually, the companies that make the show can't always follow the storyline, sometimes the author hasn't come up with the rest of the main plot, so they usually put in filler. Filler will almost always be considered bad. In other major  they could have entire arcs for the filler, but it would still be interesting. Naruto shippuden's filler IS THE OLD NARUTO EPISODES PUT INTO A REVIEW, they are things we have already seen nothing is original, and like it or not, all large anime have filler, the difference between a good and a great anime is how well the filler is managed",4.5
naruto-shippuden,"Although the series has not completely ended yet, I did love the series from the beginning. The character development was brilliant. And the plot was very smooth... until fillers started to corrupt the social structure of this series. I just wished the fillers were limited to only one for every 50 episodes, but that may be but a fairy tale. The plot itself is very unique. Same thing goes with the fighting styles, which are something you may have never seen before in any other anime. I recommend watching from the very beginning, but i shall warn you that there will be an excessive number of fillers. So much that you might give up on the whole series altogether.",4.5
naruto-shippuden,"Naruto has it all. It is an epic story of a hero in the making. Every character is carefully woven to the most minute trait. They all feel very real, most of them are far from being stereotyped. Whether they are antagonists or supporting characters, you will find out why they became  the way they are.Conflicts do not arise because some characters are intrinsically good or bad, but because everyone believes in a different path to cope with pain and suffering.This show explores every single aspect of human existence. There is revenge, betrayal, solitude, love, friendship, loss, deceit, regret, sacrifice, generosity, misunderstandings, existentialist and morality issues. As big of a fan as I am of Greek tragedies, Naruto exceeds in complexity and poignance the classics. It is a true masterpiece.It is also really funny, my favorite comedic relief characters are in this show. It's so well balanced, it does not cease to impress me. The battles are exciting, creative, smart! You will be astounded and entertained.If you do not like Naruto, I will judge you as either superficial or impatient. It is not for everyone to watch almost 600 episodes of an anime (because yes, there is no way you will be invested in Shippuden without watching the first 135 episodes of the original Naruto). But if you do stick around for more than 20 episodes, your life will be changed.(This review has been written without taking filler episodes into consideration. Some are really funny, but most have repetitive messages. Feel free to skip those. Or, if you like the characters, enjoy them as I do, as a chance to get to know your favorite people a little better)",4.5
naruto-shippuden,"My title pretty much sums it up the stars but I'll go with some extra points.The anime overall is very good. Plenty of action and character development, ridiculous and awesome fights/powers. The problem is the stupid amount of fillers. If you are binge watching then you probably won't notice, but once you catch up you will be at a point like me where the past 3-4 months have been pure fillers that interrupted the middle of a damn war, even though there is already plenty of written content for them to make REAL episodes.",4.5
naruto-shippuden,"Naruto is one of the single greatest shows I have ever had the pleasure to stumble across. I have watched Naruto since i was in middle school and am about to graduate with a bachelors degree. In all that time I have never stopped finding inspiration and entertainment in this show. It has single-handedly been responsible for more and deeper critical thinking then many college level classes I have taken. All in all if you are looking for and amazing show that will not only make you laugh, cry, scream, and possible throw shuriken but nourish your soul then welcome home, you have found your fandom at long last.",4.5
naruto-shippuden,"sure, it's been great in the past but now it's just being milked for every last cent it can make. this show is the perfect example of how to make a once good show just a useless piece of trash. if you were to look at a proper episode with story and actually having a conclusion as a 20ft. hallway, then you can only walk one step every season. so in the end you'll get bored of this hallway pretty quick and whats worse is that the people who built it decided to make another 100ft of hallway just to make it longer and for no other real reason.",5
naruto-shippuden,"I actually don't mind most of the ""fillers"" throughout both Naruto series. Since I never read the manga, I can't even tell what's filler and what's not, most of the time. But in this final season of Naruto, the fillers have gotten ridiculous. It's not that they aren't well done, in and of themselves -- they are. It's way that they are blatantly used to put off the conclusion of the climatic battle going on at the end of the main story arc that is so frustrating. I haven't calculated the exact numbers, but I feel like the ratio of filler to main story screen time has skyrocketed -- maybe 4 to 1. It has reached a point now, where the meager rationing of main story content has begun to detract from my enjoyment of it, even when it does appear. If you're reading this because you haven't started the series yet, then you might be ok to start watching it now, and by the time you get caught up, the series might be over. Then, you could just skip the last season fillers, if you wanted to. Maybe not though. It might still be going on.",3
naruto-shippuden,"This used to be an interesting show, I mean it.  But with all the fillers this show has, it really shows how much they are milking this show to make money.  Hell they have had whole seasons that were just filler.  I have stopped watching this show a year ago, I came back to check if they had finally completed this ARC.  Nope still tons of filler episodes with only a couple of cannon episodes.  I'm done with this show.",3
naruto-shippuden,"Naruto Shippuden is a must see anime. I can't even think of what life would be like for me without it. Starting of from where the first season ended, Naruto Shippuden is a fun action packed, and most of all; an easy to fall in love with anime.  It includes all of our favorite characters,  even the snake himself Orochimaru. However Orochimaru isn't the only one naruto will have to face off with, The mysterious Akatsuki, returns and this time meaning business......... The thing about Naruto Shippuden, is that it only gets more exciting!!!!  I hope you enjoy this anime as much as I have!",5
naruto-shippuden,"Studio Pierrot needs to stop this nonsense. I loved Naruto, it was something I watched with passion.  But now I feel they don't care about me as a fan. All they want is the money. Yeah I will eventually watch the ending of Naruto (the year 2017). This endless amount of fillers need to stop. I used to buy all the DVD's. I have lost my interest with Studio Pierrot and will discontinue my Naruto Collection. (No point spending money on garbage)Have a great 2016 of fillers.",5
naruto-shippuden,"When the Naruto Shippuden came out I decided to watch naruto again. And at first it was great i would of given the show 5 stars it seemed to have better pacing and definitely had better fight scenes but there was an issue. It's called Alzheimer's and Naurto Shippuden has it. In the last 3 years (mind you i could go on from the beginning but i dont have the patience to create a fillerless list of episode to watch) I watched maybe 20-30 episodes. I bet you are wondering why? Well to put it bluntly, there are 52 weeks in a year and Lets assume that they air 45 episodes a year due to holidays and whatnot. Thats a whopping 135 episodes. Of that only about 20-30 are actually not filler. (I define filler as a flashback that takes up more than 1/2 the episode or content that was added for the sake of adding it) Recently I have not actually watched the show in the last 15 weeks since not a singe episode has been cannon. The last 15 weeks has been flashbacks to Naruto the original anime. Not even updated or redrawn or digitally remastered. They just took the old episode and threw them back in. But of course there's sometimes a minute of whats going on in the plot, just so you wont forget. But just in case you do forget after they finish the flashbacks they will have a flashback to what just happened about 6-12 months ago where the plot left off. BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE !!! Commonly what happens is after they have a flashback it reminds another character of something that happened that we already know happened and has been flashed back upon over a dozen times. If that wasn't bad enough they LOVE to have a flashback that has a flashback that has a flashback (flashception sound the horn) I don't recommend even picking up this show till it's done in a few more years while they make us wait for unnecessary filler. Or you could just read the Manga since it's done.",1
naruto-shippuden,"Naruto Shippuden is one of the best anime series you will find. Critics will bash this series with so many technicalities, but the truth is that Naruto was an action series, and Naruto Shippuden follows suit. The thing that makes these two series differentiate from other action series is that you generally don't want action series for deep and full characters. Naruto distinguishes itself as a story first and everything else (action, animation, coloring, music, etc.) later. That is what makes Naruto so appealing, because the story is a good and original one, and the main characters are very well developed. Give it a shot, especially if you have already watch the Original series Naruto.",5
naruto-shippuden,"I've completely ran out of tears... for the rest of my life, when the need arises to where I would have to cry... I will be unable to... because of this first day of March, in the year 2014, the day episode 249 of Naruto Shippuden drained me of all my tears. Perfect...Family is always the most important thing one should always believe in, and as I'm close to my own family, this episode as well as all the episode in the series brings me to tears... a sentimental side I get from my mother, and yet... I'm grateful. This episode has been etched into my category of all time favorite episodes for the emotional tug of the heart.",4.5
naruto-shippuden,"This is the show that got me into anime in the first place. I still remember randomly watching the first movie without knowing anything about naruto or animes. I highly recommend watching this show for anyone who still havent. Yea, the show has waay to many fillers, and drags on in those periods, but when they back to the main story, I always get reminded why this is my favorite show of all time :).",4.5
naruto-shippuden,"One of the top three shonnen animes for a reason. I've been invested in this series from the minute it began to the current simulcasts. It draws inspiration from dragonball and HunterxHunter in all the right ways. When Naruto gets serious you get to see some of the most intense action scenes you'll ever experience. The only drawbacks to it are the filler episodes, but watching naruto and the gang catching cats/bugs etc,. or trying to see what is under kakashi's mask is the price fans must pay to have a popular weekly show like this.",1
naruto-shippuden,"This was my gateway show to watching other anime series. This series will always be my favorite anime series. It has everything you want in a series like quick flashy action, emotional rollercoaster of uplifting moments to moments that will make you cry like a baby, and lets not forget a vast storyline with many backstories and extra info about different characters and actions. It also has a huge lineup of characters that your bound to relate to more than one of them. I will say that there is a ton and i mean A TON of fillers in this series, either watch them to get backstories on characters you may like or find a filler guide and skip right through them. If you read the manga your gonna be surprised by how far behind the anime series really is due to fillers and whatnot. Even with that being said, its a must see if you watch any action style anime. BELIEVE IT!!!",1
naruto-shippuden,"Fabulous character devolopment throughout the entire anime. That's something I really love about Naruto, you can really feel what the characters are experiencing in a sense. I thoroughly enjoy hearing all of their tragic pasts, and all of the values that you learn from this show. Bonds are forever. Revenge is never the right path, leading to a never ending cycle of hatred. Never give up on the people who are important to you. The quotes are very inspiring and watching Naruto -reading it as well- has made me a better person.",1
naruto-shippuden,"This anime is just awesome. The plot is about saving the world, bonds, trust, loneliness. Naruto Shippuden is unlike any other anime, also (gasp!) unlike Naruto (the first series). The fun in the character Uzumaki Naruto is 50% gone now, replaced with a more serious and mature teen. The plot is perfect, but sometimes it drags it out, it should be fast paced. FILLERS suck, end of.Overall, I love this anime, definitely my favourite, but not in terms of comedy.",1
naruto-shippuden,"At first, when I was considering writing a review for this series, I thought I would rate it much lower. I used to dislike fillers, they were a pet-peeve for me and many others, I'm sure. However I started to think about all my other favourite stories and how sad I was that I couldn't get an in-depth look into the characters, their thoughts, and feelings towards one another. It was then that I realised that is what the fillers of this series does. It gives you a chance to see something rarely seen outside of the actual plot and for that I am most grateful! The Naruto series is by far the best storyline I have ever had the privilege of reading and watching.A major Kudos to all those involved in making this series, you've created a true masterpiece that will undoubtedly last throughout the ages.<3",2

Those were good days where there wasn't any long marathons of fillers.Mark my words. If NARUTO SHIPPUDEN: Ultimate Ninja STORM 4™ Comes out before the series finale does, I will keep this review a one star. Because  UNS4 has a story mode that will end the series like the manga did. I could only imagine the sheer amount of shame if that happens.EDIT: THE GAME. CAME OUT BEFORE. NARUTO SHIPPUDEN COULD END IT'S STORY.WHAT.THEHELL.",5
naruto-shippuden,"All though I really am a big Naruto Fan, there is now way around the many infamous fillers in this anime. The manga has already ended the series. The developers are pretty much milking the series now for money, just like how Nintendo milks Mario Kart. This anime COULD have been better if the fillers just DID NOT EVEN EXIST! GEEZ 95% percent of the war in this anime i STUPID FILLER! Just read the manga! So much better.",5
naruto-shippuden,"I've watched Naruto every since I was a kid and I can say this show successfully created an amazing story and I'm so upset that it has come to an end (not even a good ending). However, the amount of random and unnecessary fillers they put in the show would drive a person crazy. This is one of the main reasons why I gave this 3 stars as well as the reason why I stopped watching the anime and started reading the manga.",4.5
naruto-shippuden,Almost the greatest anime ever was entirely destroyed by....FILLER! It gets 3 stars for almost getting me to watch the whole thing. The horrible fillers were not just boring and destracting. They are downright DEPRESSING. I used to watch this show years ago with my infant son. We bonded over Naruto and now the show is so terrible I literally feel like crying when I think about what they did to it...,4.5
naruto-shippuden,"Honesty Naruto should have been animated by a different company in my opinion. The 3 star rating is only for the anime not the manga. The manga is FIVE STAR WORTHY. They are milking the series too much with over 400fillers. If you are new to naruto I would recommend to find a site that allows you find all the fillers and skip them. Because if you do it's great. But for old fans like me, waiting weekly for fillers to end is pain killing.",5
naruto-shippuden,"this used to be my favourite anime. A year ago I would have given this show a 8.5 out of 10. Unfortunately I am not as passionate about this anime now. First of all this show is about 50% filler and none of it furthers the story in any way. These are usually just garbage filler episodes because the Naruto franchise is being milked. Here I have included a link to a website that tells you all the filler episodes so you can skip them, trust me your not missing a thing. http://www.animefillerlist.com/shows/naruto-shippuden . Okay so the next problem is with the actual episodes that we have to wait so long to get. This anime always starts with an extremely long recap of the last episode, leaving 16 minutes for the show. Then 8 or 9 minutes of the episode are filled with flashbacks from 2 or 3 episodes ago. So on top of waiting for sometimes month to get a canon episode we only get 8 minutes of good content. Next we have the fights. Honestly I could wait for these episodes to come out if I knew there was going to be fast paced, action packed fights but this show is clearly lacking this. The fights are slow and dragged out for to long. There are always flashbacks and talking during the fight and its usually very slow. My final problem with this show is Sakura. I hate her she is a freaking b***h, ill leave it at that. Although this show has so many problems I still love it and hold It close to me. There are way better anime out there though if you like action I suggest Hunterxhunter one of the best action anime with insane fights and you can watch it here on crunchyroll or onepunchman.",5

naruto-shippuden,"A lot of people already know the story, the people who read the manga, and its very annoying for this series to be dragged this much. I know that you want to earn money, but damn. At least release actual story and not this bullcrap. Don't get me wrong, I liked the NAruto series since the first episode came out. But this is just freaking annoying and stupid. As they say, "" You either die a great show, or live long to annoy the hell out of people"" PEACE",5
naruto-shippuden,been watching this anime from the beginning and I have to say I'm getting annoyed with the show getting side tracked and getting away from the story of the here and now. if they want all that extra stuff giving a back story to the characters then they should start with the back story before the season started. It's as annoying as Dragon Ball Z taking a whole episode or 2 for Goku to throw one punch only to have it be deflected like a ping pong ball,5
naruto-shippuden,"If it's ever a progressing episode, then yeah, 5 stars. But due to the fact that 95% of the episodes are fillers, 1 star for sure. Series not good enough to be worth the wasted years worth of fillers. Whole series summed up: friendship, filler, filler, filler, filler, friendship, filler, filler, filler, filler, filler, all characters useless except one, filler, filler, more fillers about useless characters, filler, friendship, the end... thanks for watching 500 episodes of a show that could've been completed from start to finish in 50  episodes. Also, terrible animation quality except in 1/100 episodes.",5
naruto-shippuden,"The start of Naruto and Naruto Ship was amazing, brilliant, fast, upbeat and very quirky at times. You come to love the characters and have favorites. I watched this every week and got up to date with it all. I feel now its loosing its edge and the creator is enjoying the money poring from it. Its got to a stage were i have completely stopped watching this show sadly due to the very unnecessary fillers. I would suggest watching this when its completely finished (if it will ever end) I had a slight fear that its turning into 'A Bleach fiasco' Which we all knew also died. I cant understand why its actually still on the top of the list when its producer is creating SO much hatred with the amount of pointless side stories/back stories/ repeats of stories. Its getting super silly. Just end the war already, your ruining it. Other than that id suggest to watch it if your ok to watch the fillers, its if you have the patience of getting 5 weeks of fillers every other month. Although Enjoy!",5
naruto-shippuden,"I have been watching Naruto since many many years and always felt good to watch a good episode. Bleach also had its fair share of fillers but some of them were actually nice but they decided to finish the anime. The makers of this anime are trying to make money on the expense of heavy viewer dissatisfaction. I mean what is the point. I am growing to hate an anime which was once a favorite. If the anime creators have any sense of understanding, they should get on with the story line, end this story and make a new story with Naruto or Sasuke aiming for the Hokage role. That way it would not be called fillers anymore and fans will still continue watch their favorite show.",5
naruto-shippuden,"Naruto, excellent. The plot from the beginning of the original series to the end of the canon story (manga) is excellent. Problem is though, someone must not be earning enough money off the show, and decided to drag it out a few more years with filler. Most people can deal with fillers, but an unnecessary filler being chucked in, in the middle of the most important battle (debatable) in the entire series, with no queue other than 'oh, do you remember that time?'. This review is difficult to do without swearing, so I'll end it with something more sobering: the two chunin exam arcs of Naruto are the best and worst or the show, one begins the show, excellently, one decides to force itself on a beast already passing and make us all watch.",5
naruto-shippuden,"If you were to see me on the street, you would probably think that there is no way this guy watches any anime. They, however, are wrong. Many people may be inclined to say that anime is childish and made for little kids. However, Naruto is so much more than that. It is a beautiful story of a kid who had nothing and fought his way toward his dreams. This is something we can all relate to and is part of the reason why Naruto is loved by so many people. I was shocked to find how much about life I learned through this show and that is something that is important to note. It is true that Naruto has perhaps the best fighting sequences when it gets going but the true gem in this show is the message and the story. The message that no one is born inherently evil but are molded that way due to unfortunate circumstances and although things may seem hopeless at time, we must always have  the Guts To Never Give Up!",5
naruto-shippuden,"I've been watching the show for several years and I still love the Naruto Universe. A few things continue to plague the series, however, in my opinion. Early on it was the massive amount of filler episodes following the Chunin exam. It didn't seem worthwhile to watch it soon after. Exciting events happened following the exam, but things eventually dwindled down.Fast forward to Shippuden, the series revived immensely! However, things have spiraled down into filler after filler and amazing story arch to filler and filler again. I can go away from watching the show for months at a time and when I come back, I just have more fillers to go through and it doesn't seem like much has happened. Though I will continue to watch because the main story archs are simply incredible.That brings me to my other great frustration with the show: the de-powering of central characters and the everyday Jounin ninja. Ninjas will die by the most basic kunai attacks, making the title ""ninja"" seem ""chump-ish."" Characters like Kakashi also seem to become underpowered which I feel is a forced way to make Naruto look better. The balance of power is frustratingly skewed in Naruto's favor seemingly just because the show shares his name. It felt better when Naruto had to really compete for it. When he was gutsy but learning. His current power seems okay, but I hate seeing other supposedly-amazing ninjas look like chumps in order to make him better. It should be the other way around.All in all. I love the show, but wish they'd go back to a much more serious Naruto ninja show. It's best when things are serious, guys like Kakashi continue to impress while Naruto learns and shocks you.",1
naruto-shippuden,"In a comparison between the original series and Shippuden, I feel Shippuden is better. The original story line had merit, however I believe the characters themselves weren't as entertaining.  I also feel like their lines and goals were weak. I didn't watch the original series in Japanese, but in English I wanted to end my life after hearing Naruto say “Believe it” over a 100 times. I feel other than the Naruto (the main character), there wasn't much for character development. It’s a very straight forward and simplistic plot with a few back stories in between. 1st Naruto’s goal is to gain recognition, friends, and become Hokage. 2nd There is a plot twist where a deep rift between Sasuke and Naruto occurs, leaving Naruto chasing after him even now. Lastly they give a bit of background information and future predictions to tie things up.  In Shippuden however I feel like many characters were given the chance to grown and even shine in some battles. Sakura is a perfect example. Now I’m not a fan of Sakura, but she was absolutely useless prior to Shippuden, so at least now she’s not entirely holding people back. The fight against Sasori proved her worth. I thoroughly enjoyed how much background information was given about the ninja world, as well as particular charterers. You finally get answers about Naruto’s past including a detailed story about his parents. You learned about the 9-Tails. You learn about the other beasts, and the Uchiha. The plots are far more interesting and involve much more symbolism. Don’t get me wrong I think the 1st series set it up nicely for Shippuden, I just enjoy what Shippuden focuses on. It’s more about progression. It’s much more dark and mature.  The struggles are much more intense and immersive. Each major antagonist sends the show into a major background story, and they did well by tying them all together. I find Shippuden much more interesting and easier to relate to as it more mature. They incorporated many more characters and even took the time to show off the other countries abilities and histories. I feel like everyone has a bigger part to play in this series and Naruto has become much more likable as he progressed.",1

Naruto is not my first love but is by far the truest.  Every new episode surprises and enchants me.  I can't really say that I saw most of the major things in this series coming and am pleased.It has kick A action, comedy, drama, adventure, heart felt emotions.  I've laughed, cried and celebrated with the Naruto crew.  I've seen every single episode and even collected all the characters as miniature dolls.  I am so dedicated I'm even learning Japanese.Naruto is an amazing series so a big bravo to it's creator, writers and entire crew.  They should be proud.I'm not trying to give anything away, specially because it's so much more pleasant to find out on your own then have someone tell you what happened before you have a chance to get to it. So all I will say is that this will get you hooked.  Be prepared to become addicted and need a daily dose of Naruto.  I can't wait to go wherever this wants to take me.Bravo!!!Ari",3

The storyline is wonderful, with naruto uzumaki striving to bring back uchiha sasuke his friend and teammate who left konoha to gain orochimaru's power. This just shows how friends are really important to a person's life. Hope this anmie will keep going and continue to cure my anime fever! anyways this anime is great overall.",1
naruto-shippuden,"Storyline: First of all i read the manga more so then watch the show. i wont post any spoilers, but  the deal with naruto shippuden that annoys me is that they still put in useless fillers even though the manga is plenty far enough ahead. other than that, the fact that they focus more on Akatsuki rather than Orochimaru is a good thing because Orochimaru isn't all that interesting. 3/5.Music: I honestly do not care about the opening and ending songs as they do not directly affect the show in the slightest. But the naruto shippuden background music is what's most important and as far as i see it, they failed. In the first series of naruto the background music would get intense during fight scenes and Dramatic during times of peril, death etc... In naruto shippuden they changed the background music entirely and the intensity of the music is far less then it was in the first season. Tbh i think it would have been better if they stuck with the original music from the first series. 2/5.Characters: This is probably the only good aspect of the show, Some of the characters in Naruto are rather interesting, the only problem is that the interesting characters don't get enough air time. 4/5 - (lenient was thinking more of a 3.5).Animation: ill start out saying that the Animation does look ""prettier"" but the problem arises with scenes with lots of movements. the movements of the characters seem rather block-y unlike the original naruto where the animation was more smooth. an example is when they jump through forests, it looks more like they're just flying past all the trees and there is no indication that they are actually jumping. also the problem with the animation looking ""prettier"" is that during fight scenes when the characters are hitting each other, they seem to not have any dirt on them or any indication on them of having been in a fight. it just seems all rather lazy. 2/5Overall: the show is watchable to normal person. but if you are a ""Naruto Freak"" then you will probably claim ignorance to any flaws the show has and fall in love with it instantly and just give it straight ""5's"". Overall its not the worst but nor is it even close to being the best. i give it a 3/5.",1
naruto-shippuden,"If you plan on watching shippuuden watch naruto first if you didn't, it's worth it and makes shippuuden 10x more enjoyable. Then mind that at around 200 episodes the show gets far from what you will like about it at the beginning, nearly everything after that point is bullshit, I totally recommend giving up the show by then. 5 stars until said episodes, after that, below 0. Definitely watch all openings though, and listen the ost this show sure has good music.",1
naruto-shippuden,"The show started off great as a sequel to Naruto. However about half ways through some new plot elements were added (avoiding spoilers) that kind of broke the universe. Onwards from this point, the show becomes consistently worse. The plot line becomes less interesting and repetitive. Fillers are much more frequent and do not follow a story arc (very annoying when fillers take 4+ episodes). Later filler episodes revisit/copy earlier ones (state very little new material). Even worse, some filler arcs could have fit very nicely into the story, but instead came in very, very late. Currently the show is experiencing several annoying, completely plot-irrelevant  fillers (which have been inconveniently tied into the main plot-line; thus killing the plot-line even more). Despite this show not being one of my favorites, I still tuned in each week because it was entertaining and enjoyable. Now it is not even worth looking at when I can't find anything to watch ... very sad for what was once an enjoyable show and sequel to something that actually had good plot twists.",1
naruto-shippuden,I give it 1 star on account of how bad it has fallen. Naruto used to be a great show one of the best. but now its absolute garbage not even the same show. studio perriot has ruined another good show. Dont bother this show will only make you mad and its still has about another years worth of fillers i hope the really just cancel the show before we get to the next filler arc i would rather see this show shut down then continue the way its been and i hope it loses all its rating and the producers get fired and learn from there retarded mistakes because this show has turned into a very bad joke.,1

Simple as that I don't know what it is, but this is just everything I was looking for in an anime. It's great, lots of lessons to be learned, plenty of action, story and drama as well as a few well placed twists. It works where it's supposed to, and it's good.But, I gave this a 1 star rating because I want to watch the anime, I'm tired of fillers. I don't want to exaggerate but I feel like I must. For a long time there was a stretch of 3 plot related episodes, then 4+ fillers(or being completely accurate a Filler Arc). No one wants to spend a year trying to watch their favorite character walk (exaggerating) 20 feet, but never make it due to a filler episode everytime the character thinks about saying hello to one of his 10 friends between him and the destination. As the anime is right now without any exaggeration it's been months, 3-5 months before this post since the last episode that WASN'T filler. I don't care if it's technically part of the canon. No one cares what the guy who sells ramen is doingSpoiler Alert! Click to show or hide in his dream world. I made this a spoiler because I don't know who's reading this. This battle with Madara has been going on in real life for a year now. Since the war I've had to watch all sorts of pre-Shippuden flash backs that had no tangible effect on the plot. I know this because I watched the fillers, I had a friend skip the fillers and we were still able to talk about the show without any spoilers being lost.YES the fillers give backstory and make some of the characters more real. But did you want to watch what Gaara was doing during the Chunin Exams back when Team 7 and all the rest were trying their best to become better Ninja? No, you wanted to see what was happening in that war, not take a 6 week detour from the current plot. Ok, to be fair, some of the fillers are good. Some of them add to the story, or maybe explain a character, giving detail and insight. But not all of them. What I'm saying is there's a FEW good ones mixed in with a ton of useless ones. (It's still a good anime no 'bad' episodes)TL;DR: I would seriously give this a 5 star review if the pre-Shippuden flashbacks ALL had a reason for being where they are, and were put forth in a reasonable way. Example: No more than 9 episodes for the current filler arc, or maybe a hour long special. Barring those, maybe 2-3 episodes a week for filler stuff instead of 1 episode every 7-14 days.",1
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"This is addressed to people who've been complaining about Re:Zero recently, I wont use any specifics to avoid spoilers but there'll be some general topics mentioned, so maybe don't read if you're not up to date.I've seen a massive amount of people complaining about Subaru being underpowered or even saying that he's useless and that it detracts from the series. I want to say that you're wrong, obviously you get your own opinion but I want to make my point. People say that Subaru can't do anything himself and can't solve problems, and yes it does take him a long time to progress but conflict in necessary in a story. Would this be any fun if Subaru overcame every problem easily? No. If you don't want conflict in your anime go watch a slice of life. And yes he is physically weak compared to others, but think about their background versus his. He's a shut-in who worked out at home to defend his house, and he's fighting trained warriors or terrifying monsters. Would you be able to win those fights?Other people are frustrated by how Subaru can seem selfish or desperate, but that's how real people act. Subaru does lash out at people, and he makes mistakes, but humans are flawed and you have to think about the trauma he's gone through. What he goes through could leave anyone scarred, but he's fighting through it. I don't know why you'd want to watch a series where the MC doesn't struggle and grow.And finally some people are complaining that the show is too sad, or too dark. Deal with it. This is a morbid show, it showed that in episode 1, and now the suffering is getting worse. If you don't like it I'd be happy to direct you do a nice happy anime (K-On, Azumanga Daioh, Konosuba). I'm sorry if I seemed patronizing or annoying, but please don't mindlessly complain. If you want to have a respectable debate on the quality of Re:Zero, by all means talk to me, but don't just say it's bad.",4.5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"I'm writing this after watching the first episode.  I have also read the manga adaptation of the light novel this series is based on (don't worry no spoilers), which has a big influence on my opinion.As for my first impression of this anime I give it a 5 out of 5.  This is simply because I really enjoy the manga and from what I get from the first episode I think the anime will actually be better (which you won't hear people say too often). Compared to the manga, the story progresses very smoothly with time taken to develop the side characters that the manga just awkwardly stumbles over.I've read many comments that compare this show to Konosuba.  While both shows involve a track suite wearing otaku getting sent to a fantasy world with a fair share of female character, that's where the similarities end.  The ""teleport to a fantasy world"" storyline is so common in anime and manga that it is just silly to compare these two based on that alone, though to be fair, the track suite thing is kind of weird.  Konosauba is a satire of the cliché ""teleport to a fantasy world"" storyline.  On the Other hand, Re:Zero, while following the ""teleport to a fantasy world"" storyline, has a very unique and well done mystery aspect that you just don't see in the fantasy genre.  If its anything like the manga the mystery plot will get really good as the show progresses.My only criticism is on those ugly mob characters that look like they were created in MMD.  Though I overlooked this because the background art and the general atmosphere was very well done.  The evening scenes in particular where especially pleasing to look at.",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"Starting out, anyone who has watched significant anime in the past few years will be frustrated by the well-trodden premise of this series of a modern day hikkomori-sans-physical-stereotypes who is inexplicably conjured to a fantasy world; indeed even the protagonist Subaru would seem to agree. However, if it falls into any well trodden path, it would be closer to the concept of All You Need Is Kill[produced into the film Edge of Tomorrow], which is far less of a problem to have for resulting in a compelling production.Very quickly into the two parter opening will these concerns melt away. The tone of this series is delightfully muted and it seriously beings me back to older anime from about 8-10 years ago in tone, and it takes itself pretty seriously on plot and doesn't seek cheap laughs or overbearing comedic references of travel back from the modern world or otaku references. Character interactions are slow to develop and it seems like they defiantly will make us care about every character and their relationship with the other characters, even as they vary through the possible timelines. With the hugely skewed number of female protagonists it seems doomed to meet certain limitations there but that is about the only flaw I can see so far in character development, which is quite rare for this era.But the real gem here is the simple but well developed premise of the series, which leads to the motivation to essentially solve a self-imposed puzzle game. Suddenly every even minor action the main protagonist makes is a move toward either solving or more likely losing the puzzle at hand, which is initially to prevent a seemingly unstoppable series of murders and then a much bigger mission as progress is made. It would seem every episode of the series will feature progress in the puzzle, with plenty of failed solutions to show. Good luck with that, Subaru!",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"The idea isn't new as a teenage shut-in somehow gets drug into a fantasy world, but the nuances that I am seeing offer some interesting potential.  The intrigue begins when the MC realizes what his unique position is, and has to figure out a way to free himself from a seemingly hopeless situation.  It's like being stuck in a horribly difficult rpg with limited save points, and a strict set of goals to meet between each one.  Every time he dies things get reset to a specific point, where he has to restart with the knowledge gained from his previous attempts.  The up side to this is there is very little repetition to bore people to death.  Even though he is covering the same time frame multiple times, they do a great job of keeping things fresh with the characters and scenes.  Get ready for a dark fantasy adventure spinning in circles of fate.Subaru is not quite the typical shut-in, as he works out to keep his physical condition in good shape in case of break in.  His propensity to initially buy in to the concept of being transported to a different reality is humorous at times when he keeps trying to fit events into his 'perceived reality' manufactured from games, manga, and anime.  The cold hard truth of things becomes apparent though early on as the only tools at his disposal are his wits, muscles, and an obnoxious ability to start from zero with all his memories intact.  Naturally everything and everyone else doesn't in share those experiences, so it is actually a double edged tool.  Personally I like the concept, and it looks like they are doing a good job with the story.Be forewarned, the story starts out grim and bloody, and continues from there to eventually spiral through despair and madness to a brutal and sadistic level.  The story and characters are well played though to keep you hooked even as it leaves your nerves raw at times.",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"OK 8 Episodes in, and this is a show I will absolutely never forget. There have been TONS of shows with this premise. There have been TONS of shows with this type of magic. There have been TONS of shows with this animation style. But the way the protagonist struggles in this show Its amazing. Put into the same position as he is in, I would be a living puddle on a street somewhere by episode 3. This show screams at you with pure raw real emotion almost every episode. Whether it be happiness, fear, sadness, anger. Attack on Titan conveys anger, hope, and hatred this well. Natsume Yujin Cho: Kindness. Theres plenty of shows that do a great job conveying singular or a few emotions. This show runs the gamut, and it runs them almost every single episode, all the while Giving you great action and tons of Mystery and puzzles to solve. I dont think my brain has wandered once while watching one of these after episode 1.Edit 15 eps in, and it just gets better.",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,This is a really good and intriguing anime very unique in many aspects already watched episodes 1A and 1B and already hooked. And the fact that it took the intro to reel me in is impressive because usually it takes about at least 3-5 episodes to get to the point but with this you will not be boarded you will keep coming back for more to see what happens next but don't let this review persuade you watch it and experience it yourself. And I know there are reviews that say this is like another anime but that is irrelevant this anime is its own and has a very good story line and how it is plotted hope to have a blast with this and warning episode 1B Leaves you with a cliffhanger which is Awsome.,5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"At first when I started this serious I thought it was an interesting concept. I felt the character development was rather slow and that the main protagonist or ""hero"" was weak.Then as I finished episode 15 today, I have come to see the magnificence of this serious and how it is all fitting together. I have experienced laughter, sorrow, pain, grief and frustration. What an emotional rollercoaster, please take the time to watch this anime and support authors and studios that would produce such quality works.",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,This is not konosuba After watching 1a/1b  I instantly fell in love with this anime. However my first impression was that it this would be an average neet shut-in anime that would have a bunch of cliché scenes and it would be just a regular anime for this season. Well boy I tell you my opinion sure did change when I watched 1b. I have no credit in this community but but take my word  this anime will not disappoint and from here it can only get better. Re:Zero depending on how it plays out can probably become one of the best animes for 2016 and climb to the top anime favorites of lots of people.  Watch this anime!!!,5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"So watched 19 episodes so far with my friend. This anime is good...like really good.A fairly generic premise of a slightly loser guy from the real world getting summoned to a fantasy world. He has a special power that makes him yadda yadda yadda...the premise made me pass it over, only a friend who'd seen it recommending it to me made me try it.I am now going to be that friend to you, try this show. It is an amusing and well executed twist on fairly generic anime tropes for the first few episodes, then it does something I've seen another anime recently do.One Punch Man asked the question of what would emotionally/psychologically happen to a real person if he attained ultimate power. Saitama becomes bored and loses desire to do anything when his enemies die sin one punch.Re:Zero goes the same route, what would actually happen to a real person if he died, an incredibly terrifying, painful, scared, desperate death, then suddenly woke up and had to do it all over? All his achievements and and memories or good experiences are wiped away along with the bad ones. Motivation becomes hard to find, the few times he ""checkpoints"" become branching points, and he emotionally has to find stable points to grasp to.This is what truly made me sit up in my seat and bump this anime up from a fun and interesting 4 star, to a 5 star anime that other anime NEED to take cues from. My cardinal sin in anime is the bland milquetoast main character, and Natsuki Subaru leaves that trope behind and does something fresh, interesting, and well executed. Which is all I can ask honestly when most of the anime coming out is the same generic schlock.Oh and  got waaaay invested in the characters. Waaaaay invested, which made the trials they go through so much more poignant.",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"This anime was a surprising blessing for me to watch. It immediately captured my attention from episode 1A, and I obviously went right for 1B afterwards. I was so captivated in the anime that I actually had the countdown of it playing for about 18 hours before the episode 2 came out itself. The ED song, and the OP are definitely great as well, very fun anime to watch. My main disappointment was-Main character IS clueless, but only in a few ways. Once he actually gets the hang of something he knows what to do.This anime is great in leaving you off with a feel that you want to come back, just to find out what's going to happen next. You know those books where you just hate the story, but you keep reading because you're so interested in what's going to happen next? This anime COULD be like that for you. Personally however, the anime captivated my attention from the first 15 seconds, and I'm definitely going to be around for all 25 episodes. (Yes, it IS going to be a 25 episode series.) Very intriguing anime, never seen a timeleap in a medieval timeline. I'm hoping this anime gets a lot more positive attention, because in my honest opinion it does deserve it.",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"I heard about the hype this show was getting so I decided to give it a shot. Boy am I glad that I did. It simply blew me away. The music, the animation, the characters, and the story were all brilliant. This so can also be very brutal but the payoff so far is huge. Lastly the main character Natsuki Subaru is really entertaining to watch for me, I love his character. Definitely watch this show!!Edit: After finishing the series it is alongside Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood as my two favorite anime. I have even bought all the manga and light novels currently out to show my support for the series.",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"As a diligent disciple, I cannot begin to express my respect for this anime. From the beginning, I knew this was more than some wretched, ugly, lowly, diminutive, sinful anime that shamelessly copies other themes or plotlines. Yes, He is wearing a tracksuit. Yes, He was transported to another world. YES YES YES. YES! MY BRAIN TREMBLES! However, this is where the similarities end. Truly a beautiful picture of madness and despair at times, this anime manages to elicit emotions that others simply CANNOT. The usual standards of character development, animation, soundtrack, and plot are all, without doubt or hesitation, five stars..... no, six stars. It is indeed the picture of true diligence and presented as such. This show is unique and both its protagonist and villain are AMAZING as well as the supporting cast.  This is an unforgettable work of art that must not be ignored and must be diligently watched to its conclusion. To ignore any parts of this would be.......truly slothful.",4.5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"I think everyone goes through those three phases when watching this: like, hate, then love. The hate started for me during the arc when Subaru was trying to survive at the mansion. It seemed rather pointless and plodding at the time, and I didn't like the maid characters at all. The animation and action scenes were also not very appealing to me. That was the worst arc by far for me, but after seeing the whole show, I have gained a better appreciation of that arc as it sets the stage for his psychological breakdown later on. I think most other people liked that arc and hated the next arc where Subaru was trying to prevent utter disaster on his own and was rather pathetic and unlikable. I actually think that arc was very well-done, and it showcased the tremendous obstacles he would have to overcome in the final arc. The final arc was mostly satisfying, and it culminated in a really great ending. Many (dare I say most) animes have very poor endings with lots of dangling plot points. The ending here feels like a solid resolution of a major story arc without actually being the end of the greater story, which seems like it still has a lot of meat to it. It has its good and bad points, but ultimately I love the story.One thing I loved throughout the whole show was the animation. Every episode was consistently well-animated, even when the story called for some pretty crazy sequences. Some of the character designs and animations really left a huge impression. Betelgeuse, in particular, was just a fascinatingly constructed character all around. The voice actors also did an outstanding job. Subaru's voice actor was the standout, being required to go through quite a wide range of emotions and attitudes. The voice actor for Betelgeuse was terrific as well, and you will never hear anything like him ever again, I guarantee it. Some other voice actors were a little too typical, but overall, the quality of the performances was very good.I'm looking forward to season 2, assuming it gets a second season.",4.5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"Definitely my favourite anime and I'm not even to gory stuff because it definitely had its moments where it made your brain tremble, but, surprisingly enough, it appealed to the majority of anime community and made its way to my top 10 and eventually won my heart. Its story-telling is remarkable and the author sure knows how to foreshadow things for the distant future.If you except a certain episode which makes me think about it for a bit, I'd surely watch it all over again with no regrets! Already watched couple of the latest episodes several times by now!",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"Never had I ever gone from tearing up in sadness to tearing up in happiness and joy in the span of 2 episodes until I saw Re:Zero. Never before had I seen a show with much tragedy, loss, deep depictions of sadness and insanity, but also have just as much hope and purity until I saw Re:Zero. This show just blew me away. The characters, the voice-acting, the writing, the animation, man all of it is just fantastic. The story is fairly unique and the characters that drive it are some of the best I've ever seen in any anime. Honestly this show, to me, is masterfully done and has quite easily earned my love and respect. So go watch, you won't regret it.",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"VisualsThe visuals were consistent throughout most of the show with animation errors being few and far between. Things at time could get bloody without being too gory or ridiculous with the amount of blood... at times. However the visuals were never ugly, sometimes creepy but not unintentionally so.Story The story is one of the best things about this anime, you've more than likely seen or watched something with a similar but it's rare for something to do it so well. The story for this was great and you can tell more thought was put into a lot of areas of the story. However by the end of season one you will find yourself still asking quite a few questions that may not ever get an answer in anime form.Characters The characters in this show by far are the best thing about it. Subaru by far is the most human character I've ever watched in anything be it anime, movie, or your average TV show. Subaru's character development happens throughout the course of the show and very rarely will you feel as if he did not grow, even if it is just a little bit. However this show has a really bad habit of introducing interesting characters that seem to disappear into thin air or only show up a small handful of times.3D/CGI CGI sticks out like a sore thumb in this anime as it does in any other, however it only really appears in the capital to help show how busy the streets are, so while it is present it doesn't ruin anything.",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"Wow... i was really skeptical about this anime. I'm tired of the ""otaku gets transported for a fantasy world"" thing but out of the blue i decided to watch the first episode (it's divided in two parts, A and B).Now, what a great, great anime!!! It has a really ""Erased"" vibe and the characters are so good, the twists so well written... and WHAT A VILLAIN!!!! So creepy and disturbing!It will be hard to keep the quality of this first episode, if they manage to achieve that, we can be watching a true masterpiece!",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"Simply stunning work. The animation is great; I'm glad they limited the amount of CG to some background characters and ground dragons instead of rendering major assets like buildings. Art style (character design, etc.) is easy on the eyes, meshing well with the gorgeous world design and backgrounds. Music is fantastic and diverse, always complementing each scene--never understating or overstating. White Fox blows me away with this masterful adaptation. I want to thank everyone involved on their hard work, and I can't wait to see how they tackle the rest of the series.",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"I thought this anime would be an anachronistic light comedy with some romance and maybe a little action.  Having just finished watching episode 18, I am still astounded by the brutality used by these storytellers in ripping emotions out your guts like a certain assassin who will not be named.I feel like I should warn particularly delicate individuals that if they're not prepared to be emotionally savaged by this story, they may need to choose a lighter subject matter like the earlier mentioned Stein's Gate, or maybe Madoka Magica.  The anime is quite beautiful and the character designs are distinctive and enjoyable. The character concepts wedded to those designs are interesting and have more depth than you would expect, especially for the supporting characters who are less walk on parts than they are people with multiple facets to their personalities.  Who would have expected that the appa vendor had a backstory but by 10 episodes in you began to really know more about how he fits into the market and city environment.It's the additional investment in all the side stories that makes Subaru's adventure seem more real when compared to a story solely focused on his relationship with Emilia.  I wait every week until Sunday for the next episode to stream, even though the last few episodes have made it feel like I was waiting for someone to stab me in the guts and start pulling out my intestines.  Despite the unease, anticipation of pain, and suffering I feel, I can't just leave well enough alone because I've become invested in this story.  If it weren't so good, I could just abandon it, but that's the rub, it is that good.",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"(Written after watching episode 6, but as spoiler-free as possible!)Firstly, I have to say that I was not expecting this show to be this good. I signed up for a conventional fantasy-type adventure, that isn't particularly original, but still delivers. Well. I got that. And more.This show takes all the conventions, tropes, and stereotypes of fantasy animes and games, and plays around with them to make a legitimately enjoyable piece of fiction. It hooks you in places where you expect the predictable and keeps you on the edge of your seat (which almost never happens to me).It's funny, romantic, gory, and filled with twists, but it balances all these things pretty well. However, I have to say it is the relationships between characters which really keeps you watching it. They're all so complex, which makes them more unique that those of other fantasy animes.",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,Currently at 2 episodes the show has the potential to be great. If they take the time to develop the story and dont rush things you wont want to miss this anime. The show has a main character who suddenly appears in an alternate universe who then begins to roam around and start his adventure assuming that he is destined for something great. Has some early comedic remarks by the main character but begins to go to another level after the first episode. After watching episode 2 i'm sitting here wanting more and knowing that i'll be counting down the days till the next episode each week,5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"This is simply myself writing a review after watching the only episode out right now. Surely I couldn't come up with a decent review seeing as I've only seen one episode; however, you can tell if most anime are good or not from the get go after watching the first episode. Now, I see people seem to be complaining about the fact it doesn't make sense that he hasn't caught onto the fact that he Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hidehas repeated time. Now, I've not read the manga nor watched the anime people are calling similar to this, but from what I have seen this anime has good animation and beautiful designs and great world building. People don't seem to remember that, Subaru is only human. Humans will deny things they don't understand and try to block it out. Now, I agree that ""being transported to another dimension"" has been used before, but it's how it is used is what makes the difference between original and unoriginal. From what I have seen, this show has taken it to another level and is much darker than anime that have this same characteristic in the fantasy genre.I can't wait to see the next episode. It was a thrill and I was left wanting more at the end. It's definitely a must watch, even with material that has been used before. I was impressed as nothing seemed too rushed, nor did it look like they cut corners. If you like fantasy anime with a more mysterious and darker take, this is the anime for you without a doubt. Also, it has cute girls. What's not to like?",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"This is an epic. Made up of scenes and sequences, its narrative nonetheless coheres into something extraordinary because it is basically philosophical.I'm not going to say that other ways of looking at it are not valid, or even that I am right, but I truly believe Re:Zero is a remarkable depiction of love, our need for it and fear of it and pursuit of it and mourning for it. Every reset brings Subaru deeper into love, not only for Emilia but for other characters, combined with the fact that every time he does it, someone he loves will not know how much or why he loves them.Given this, the utter horror of much of the show makes perfect sense, because it is about the terrors of love, the way we invest in it and fight for it and die for it. All the resets bring mixtures of gratification for love, but none bring the combination Subaru can put his finger on and say ""That's it!""Because that's not the way love is.It's certainly a great adventure story with uncountable other facets. But for me, its look at love is unflinching and brilliant. It's hard for us all to face the fragility and uncertainty of our love. This show wrestles us down and rubs our face in it. If we can take it, we should be grateful that it took the time to do that.",5

rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"I'll be focusing on the writing of the characters for this review, as I believe it to be the most essential partAt points, you'll hate Subaru, at points, you'll believe he's a honest to heart great protagonist, and for that I give the author props, it's hard to make a character lovable otaku who wants to get the main heroine, to an absolute asshole, to then a lovable guy who wants to save the one he loves, along with side-characters who show their true colours, and their true personality based on what Subaru had done.The MusicI find the music in this anime to be on the gothic side, especially the openings, the first OP pops to be as a gothic song, with the sounds in it pointing me to that answer, and I personally like that. The anime already had a dark tone with the first episode, not being afraid to show gore, which lead into the OP perfectly. Watch Mother's Basement for a full review on the OP, since he's great at that. The second OP was less 'gothic' in a sense, but it still kept the feeling, MYTH&ROID did a great job on this one, the violin stands out with the vocal chopping of the singer. Every instrument was able to shine with this (IMO it was a great OSU beatmap lol!). Stay Alive, sung by Emilia's CV, was genuinely perfect. It brought me to tears at episode 23, the animation staff really know how to take away the boringness of an ending, making this actually one of the first anime where I watched every ending, as the anime was continued into the endings, keeping it interesting as the music began to join in. STYX_HELIX is not as great in my opinion, however in episode 25 it really works well, it's a great slow ending for a quick, fast paced episode (I mean the rest of them). The OST is great, it's able to sneak its way in without you realizing, and takes you by surprise when something major, or something that's meant to strum your heartstrings, it really hits you hard then, and you'll notice it.Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideCharacters + a bit of StoryWARNING, LONG AF)Where do we start? Subaru himself as I stated before is a perfect example of character growth, with many other anime you'll see the character become more modest if they're OP AF, or become more caring like Oregairu, or something else. But here we see none of that, we see a weak, powerless, selfish character, who did everything out of his love for the main heroine (who didn't even like him back), into a smart, tactical, relatively strong (mentally wise), caring character. You must understand the amount of pain Subaru had to have gone through mentally to have to die that many times, and still have the willpower to continue fighting, knowing that he'll have to experience the exact same thing if he doesn't do anything. This does get to him, and he has a breakdown for 6 episodes, before he can regain his thoughts with the help of Rem. As I know many of you can think of many times through out the anime where you thought: ""If I just kill myself and reset time, I can make things right!"" You're not wrong with that mindset, I had the exact same mindset, however, I believe the fact that Subaru doesn't just kill himself to reset everything is because he's afraid to experience the pain again, you probably would too, but realize this is a character with almost zero to none willpower until his recouping with Rem. He couldn't bring himself to do it unless it really fucked everything up (like episode 7). It's due to this fear of not wanting to die, that when he resets, he tries his absolute best to not suffer through that again, and to stay alive while making everything right, and that's where his willpower comes from. Knowing that he needs to, no, he MUST make things right, Subaru willingly resets in episode 7, and tries his best to gain the trust of Rem and Ram in the mansion, but it's here that Subaru realizes he can't keep up an act of faking, and so he returns to his selfish self for another few episodes. Episode 13 is where he cracks. Whilst most of you believed that Subaru could've just reset after his argument with Emilia, what you don't get is that Subaru NEEDED to be scolded by the one he loved, the one he said he was fighting for, to realize that he was just being selfish, and not actually doing this out of any means. Think of it this way, if Subaru had reset, he would be in fear that something horrid might happen to Emilia if he had not gone, or worst, he would've still been a selfish character until the end of the anime, not solving anything. This scolding by Emilia was absolutely necessary for Subaru to develop into the main character of most Isekai genres, and for him to love Emilia, without saying that's the only reason he was fighting. He gains more things to fight for in his slump, Rem, the mansion, all the other characters, he gains the knowledge to fight, and the willpower to not cower in fear anymore. His encounters with Betelgeuse had definitely taken a toll on him, you can even see him physically giving up, however, after his talk with Rem, he loses this fear, and accepts the fact that he can't win alone, even becoming comrades with the knight that started the events in episode 12, this is a major turning point for Subaru, and it's because of this that he becomes such a great, rich, interesting character. Rem. While most of you just blatantly scream out: ""REM BEST GIRL!!!"" due to her appearance in episode 18, I must say that I absolutely agree with you, Rem is an amazing character for doing that for Subaru, it ultimately saved him as a character, and without her, he would've stayed in his slump, not solving anything. However take a look at Rem in every other episode, she's a tsundere even if you don't think about it, it's not a normal tsundere, and whilst I would say it's about 10% tsundere, the rest of it is her being loyal to her master who saved her that night in the village, and the will to protect her older sister, who sacrificed everything for her. Rem shows extreme loyalty, but also shows her cute side from time to time, along with her satanic form, in order to save Subaru from the moment they team up. I find it quite interesting when she just started to love Subaru as he showed her another side of herself, the loyal, monster-slaying demon Rem, falling for Subaru over one good deed. It's not a bad thing, but it's quite the interesting development. Emilia. Most of you would say she's a generic heroine, who doesn't understand the hero's love for her, but she's more than that. She's a selfish character, who just wants to do right in the world due to her looking exactly like the Witch. Since I'm already doing minor spoilers. Emilia knows she knows she's the Witch Satella, in appearances that is, being half-elf, almost everyone, even commoners, know that she is a perfect resemblance of the Jealous Witch, however, in episode 1A, she tells Subaru her name is Satella in order to keep him out of the throne wars, as telling someone she is Satella, the Jealous Witch, would normally scare someone off almost immediately, however Subaru, being from another world, doesn't connect the dots, and in return Emilia decides that he is worth trusting, as he wouldn't give her special treatment that everyone else around her does, and that's why she told him her real name. She decided then and there that someone who wouldn't judge her based off her looks would be worth trusting and believing in, as all she had been receiving was special treatment from everyone around her. She's a selfish character not in a bad way, as all she wanted was to be treated normally, and because of that selfishness, she becomes selfless, doing anything to get anyone to treat her like she isn't the Jealous Witch. IMO, it's a mix of selfishness + selflessness to become a normal person. This is what makes Emilia an interesting character alongside Subaru, because whilst the story revolves around him, the tales we get here and there about Emilia are extremely interesting and shows why she's doing all she did, why she trusts Subaru, why she cares for him (even a bit), and why she wants to become the ruler. Emilia. Best. Girl. She doesn't realize all she's done to help Subaru progress, scolding him was such a vital part to the story, I cannot say how many props I could give to her, she doesn't understand why Subaru does why he does, why he cries his lungs out, why he loves her, why he does anything, but due to her trust in him because he gave her treatment of a normal person, she copes with it, and goes through it. She really is the BEST GIRL!The AnimationThis animation is superb, the fact that this anime itself is gory, the anime is able to show gory scenes, that makes your stomach feel a bit ill, but not to the point of turning away from the screen. It's the perfect amount to make you get a little bit grossed out, but enough to make you stay and watch, whilst shedding tears at time. EMILIA'S SMILE REALLY IS PERFECT!Voice ActingI find Subaru's voice actor to have a certain sound in his voice, it gives off the fact that Subaru is grossed out at times, scared at times, and in power at times. Kobayshi really knows how to do his job with Subaru, it's just fantastic. I've also got to give Matsuoka props, I didn't even realize it was him at first, normally I can recognize him instantly, but I had to make sure it was him, as he sounded so different for Betelgeuse, he really managed to live up to the expectations I had for someone who looked like Betelgeuse. Takahashi also manages a great job at making Emilia angry, sad, and happy at times. Murakawa and Minase also manage a fantastic job at the mono toned twins who speak at the exact same time, and who play off each other.Maybe I've been rambling on for too long, but that's my general thoughts of this anime, a great spin on the Isekai genre.",4.5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"best anime of year. love all of the arcs. The second is definitely the worst. The main character makes you love him and hate him at the same time. Great character development of Subaru and Rem. Not a huge fan of Emilia but I understand it based on where the series is going. It helps if you read the manga. The show will absolutely get better as you continue to watch it. Definitely need a second season because at least 11 questions are unanswered.Great if you like shows such as SAO, MAR, guilty crown, code geass.",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"There isn't much to say of Re:ZERO that hasn't been said already. It's a terrific, immersive, and engaging anime filled with likable characters, a strong and amazing story, great animation, and awesome scenarios and environments. Although there are some infuriating moments, you will finish every episode wanting to watch the next, and the next, and the next. Personally, I get bored of anime quite quickly, I tend to stop watching midway through, give up or just generally not pay attention to episodes after a while, Re:ZERO kept me watching the entire time. Not once whilst watching did I decide to pick up my phone and browse through social media out of boredom. The characters are adorable, likable, well drawn, and every other positive adjective under the sun. You find yourself really enjoying and missing the presence of even the antagonists, because every character really reflects on you - and they all feel special. It's quite a beautiful anime, and a must-watch.",4
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"I'm not one to write a super in-depth review, but I just had to find a way to rate this 5 stars here. This quickly became one of, if not, THE best animes I have seen! I originally only decided to check this out because I have seen the 2 maid girls everywhere and was one of the top things to watch on Crunchyroll and I was hooked right from the first episode. This show is an emotional roller coaster full of mysteries, funny moments, and heartwarming scenes and we should be thankful that all episodes are available to us already since almost every single one ends with a cliffhanger. Openings are great as well!I won't spoil a thing so I highly recommend EVERYONE to watch this and see what all the hype is about!",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"Very few shows, especially in anime, are  truly suspenseful. Even in a series as dark as, say, Berserk, we know that Guts will eventually win in the 2050 finale. Will bad things happen? Yes. Will people die? Most assuredly. Will Guts be a badass? Hell yeah he will. Will he ""win"" in the end? Yes, yes he will.Re:ZERO is a rare case where a show is truly suspenseful. When you watch, you watch the show with bated breath, because you know for a fact that everything Subaru (the fact that I can remember his name is a big deal to me) has worked for, all his efforts, his connections with the people he's met, his successes, his laughter and tears, all of it can be gone in an instant. We watch knowing that there is a very real danger of a good situation turning lethally bad in an instant, because that is exactly what happens multiple times over the course of the show. As we watch, we're always wondering: ""Is he going to succeed this time? Or is he going to die horrifically again?""The show is truly magical in the way it creates suspense, and it uses it to its full effect. It's also interesting to see the mental toll it takes on our protagonist. From the perspective of the show, all the events we see are happening within a few weeks. From the perspective of the secondary characters, they really haven't known Subaru for very long. From Subaru's perspective however, he's spent months in that place. He has had many more experiences with the other characters than they can ever possibly know, he's struggled more for these characters than they can ever possibly appreciate. it's a real tragedy, seeing him struggle without there being a single person that he can confide in, not one person to share the immense burden and pain he has to deal with.The show isn't perfect, but I think it's a god-damned masterpiece",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"In an increasingly epic story in which Zero is the most important number, the art, animation, voice acting, and even music keep me reliably addicted and craving more.There are moments when the amount of adversity the protagonist faces seems completely unfair or when I wish that I could take over and force him to make different choices, but the unexpected results that lead to victory make me laugh.This is a clever series, but it is also an emotional roller coaster that literally goes flying off the tracks at times. I have learned to expect the unexpected and enjoy the show rather than pick it apart, and that is a rare treat for me.",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"Re:Zero -Starting Life in Another World (ゼロから始める異世界生活, Re:Zero Kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu), is one of the brightest gems of the Summer 2016 season. While it is not something flawless, as one might think, this series is definitely doing its best to be enjoyable and interesting for its viewer. In my opinion, the fact that the creator of the series actually cares is very commendable. However, it is an open secret that trying to be fascinating and being fascinating is not the same thing. Thankfully, it is not one of these cases. Allow me to share my opinion on Re:Zero -Starting Life in Another World, on the anime that is able to leave one speechless, on the anime that bullies you, and on the anime that shows you many events, which are absolutely impossible to foresee.Re:Zero -Starting Life in Another World is a Japanese light novel series written by Tappei Nagatsuki and illustrated by Shinichirou Otsuka that also has three manga adaptations and an anime television series adaptation by White Fox, which began airing on April 4, 2016. The series tells us a story of Natsuki Subaru, a normal young man that lives his normal life in the modern Japan. However, one day, he is summoned to another world. Without knowing the person that summoned him, or the reason for being summoned in the new world, he soon befriends a silver-haired-half-elf girl, Emilia. Due to some unknown circumstances, the girl is being targeted by an unknown assassin. The assassin manages to kill the two and everything seems to be over. Yet, a second later, Natsuki Subaru awakens and discovers his new ability that he names ""Return by Death."" That new ability gives him the power to reverse time by dying; however, only he remembers the events of the previous timeline. Why was Natsuki Subaru summoned in this mysterious world, who gave him the power to reverse time? Find the answer by watching Re:Zero -Starting Life in Another World now. The first thing that might come to your mind after reading the description of Re:Zero -Starting Life in Another World’s story-line  is that this anime is a mix of Steins;Gate, Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo!, and Boku dake ga Inai Machi. And I must say that you will be right to think so. Of course, this anime has nothing to do with comedy, but all these four anime do have a few things in common. Anyway, Re:Zero -Starting Life in Another World reworks all mistakes of its predecessors doing its best to be entertaining and I must say that Re:Zero -Starting Life in Another World manages to do it. It is an open secret that the most important thing for all story-lines is to be complex: one should never be able to foresee more than thirty percent of events that will happen in the next episodes. In case of the anime we are talking about, you might have theories on first, on second, …, on thirteenth episodes, but all your theories will be destroyed in an instant. That is, in my opinion, the best part about the story-line of this anime. The animation of Re:Zero -Starting Life in Another World is mostly top notch. There are many characters, they have sometimes unusual and sometimes very beautiful outfits, monsters, demons, some unknown creatures, and magic spells and they all are beautiful. At the same time, when this anime should become dark, it becomes dark. It is so amazing that it helps you to dive in the universe of Re:Zero -Starting Life in Another World. Without a doubt, it is not flawless, but it is on the level, which is very important for all anime that have such a setting. The OST is on the level, as well. From pop music to amazing orchestral pieces, Re:Zero -Starting Life in Another World even focuses on music, which some anime tend to not do. Of course, it is not that important, but the amount of attention this anime pays to its music only helps you to dive into the universe of Re:Zero -Starting Life in Another World and to understand it better. I will not hide the fact that sometimes the music should have been more epic: when you see a good battle, the music should be epic very, but it is still able to make you have gooseflesh. Another part of this section, which is also worth mentioning, is the cast of this anime. All voice actors did one hell of a job making their characters vivid and lively. If it is a villain, you hate them with all of your heart, if it is one of the main heroes, you just wish that they succeed in everything they do and you cannot even imagine what you will do if something bad happens to them. The cast of Re:Zero -Starting Life in Another World consists of the main characters, Rem and Natsuki Subaru, supporting characters, and villains. While I would argue that the main characters do not receive enough development, I completely agree with the fact that supporting characters should have received more development. However, I believe that the main characters and the villains compensate for it well, since Re:Zero -Starting Life in Another World has the edgiest villains that you have ever seen in your life. Anyway, let us talk about the main characters: Rem and Natsuki Subaru.Natsuki Subaru is the male protagonist of the series. On the way home from the convenience store, he is suddenly summoned to another world. He later discovers an ability that he names ""Return by Death"" that allows him to go back in time, if he dies. And the most interesting part about it is that only he remembers what happened and he cannot tell anyone about this ability. Natsuki used to be a hikimori, being absolutely useless, he has never done anything in his life. However, in this new world he should not only try to become more powerful, but also to use his wit. He will not be granted with the power to destroy the whole world, he does not have a guardian angel, or a harem of cute girls that will help him in every situation. He just has no other choice but to do everything alone, which makes him change himself. His character development is amazing and you just want to not see him suffer. Rem is the second main character of the series. She has a younger sister and both of them work at Emilia’s mansion.  When Subaru meets her, she shows absolutely no signs of being interesting; however, as the story progresses, Rem stops being a doll and becomes a very interesting character. The supporting characters of Re:Zero -Starting Life in Another World do not receive enough development; however, as I have already mentioned, the villains compensate well for it. You just want to see their death, you just want to see their sufferings, and you hate them with all of your heart. While I understand that it is impossible to grant enough screen time for all characters, I still think that all characters are very interesting to follow and it should be more than enough for you.All in all, I cannot guarantee you that you will like this series and I am not going to do it. Personally, I like the fact that this anime tries to rework mistakes of its ancestors in order to not make them again, I like the fact that the characters of this series are realistic and not overpowered like in some other series, I like the fact that it is never possible to guess what will be shown in the next episodes, which is very important, as well. With every episode, you are trying to prolong your enjoyment and to watch this series little by little; however, it is simply not possible. You just want to know what will happen in the next episodes. It is, of course, not flawless, nothing is, but if you want to see something very dark, I would highly recommend you to give Re:Zero -Starting Life in Another World a try. I hope that you will enjoy watching Re:Zero Kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu!",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"I've watched a fair amount of Anime in my time, but I've never once left a review. However, this show forced my hand. It would be unjust to experience a show like Re:ZERO and not leave a review. Fear not, there are no spoilers ahead.I leave this review as I am currently caught up at 18 episodes in, so I have a sizable amount of credibility to contribute with respect to my opinion of the show. The characters are extremely well fleshed out and frequently encounter genuine emotional and personal struggles. Gone are the days of fantasy Anime wrought with one-sided characters that prance about and merely provide entertainment. Due to the nature of one of Re:ZERO's central plot features, characters have ample time to leave a lasting impression. No side character is left to rot in the depths of obscurity. Simultaneously, side characters and main characters are included a the precise time that they are needed the most. The characters' appearances are sensible and never seem forced or unneeded. This leads to a truly immersive story line, and makes the characters seem much more like real people.The plot of Re:ZERO is nothing short of brilliant. As I said in the beginning of my review, I am not including any spoilers, so unfortunately I cannot go into much detail with regard to the content of the plot itself. However, let it suffice to say that Re:ZERO has a plot that will surely keep you guessing as you desperately try to avoid slipping off of the edge of your seat.This show delivers a dark and refreshing twist on the notorious fantasy plot that has appeared semi-frequently in recent Anime seasons. Whether you have or have not seen previous fantasy shows, Re:ZERO is a must. I have no reservations in giving this show 5 stars. Please, do yourself a huge favor and watch the show that has blown up the current season, because its popularity is not without reason.",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"If I was to review this show based solely on the protagonist, I would urge you to give it a pass. He's nothing we havent really seen before, the angsty, stubborn fool who never really does things right but tries and often gets those around him in more trouble. Typical. Where the show really shines though, is the plot.If there is a manga, I have not read it, and I came into the show knowing very little about the plot other than the synopsis posted below the poster. So after the first episode, I assumed the main mechanic of the show would not happen again, and it would follow a plot similar to other shows of this nature. I was very wrong.The mechanic of the show, as you find out in episode one, is the main character being killed, and resurrecting at a time before whatever kills him happened. I'm sure I have seen this somewhere before, but the way they handle it and the consequences, along with making it so that he fails even when he succeeds sometimes, is actually quite intriguing. The writer knows how to make the device interesting, and how to manipulate it and add in twists even when the character has seen the situation play out a dozen times before. Not many shows with this device have managed to throw a wrench in the protagonists plans when he should know what is happening, and I applaud the writers for trying to make things difficult for him. He is not a hero in the show, he is simply someone who is trying to learn the right way to do something by failing over and over again.",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"As someone who has watched a lot of anime (Yes, I'm a weeb), I can honestly say this is in my personal top 10. To anyone who is interested in watching a great anime, I can't recommend this one enough. From comedy to action to drama, this anime will play your emotions like a puppet. Just when you think you've had enough, it'll pull you right back in. Anyone looking to cringe, laugh, cry, and truly enjoy the art of anime MUST watch this anime. BE PREPARED FOR THE EMOTIONAL ROLLERCOASTER YOU WILL INEVITABLY BE RIDING.",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"I'm really confused on how I should review this show because of the fact that it's both awesome and bad at the same time. The show treats our dear friend Subaru as a worthless being and throws us for a loop whenever we feel that Subaru may just be a badass.I feel like there's a lot to say about this show but I just cannot put it into words. The show somehow manages to sneak in a new plot twist every other episode; leaving you to think you understand everything but then pulling the rug from under you and saying, ""Oh you didn't see that coming?""I feel really bad for Subaru and I really just want to see him succeed.Take caution when watching this anime, and be ready for **** to hit the fan real quick.",5

The twists are phenomenal, the characters are amazing and so fleshed out, the music is so, so good, the animation is awesome, the voice acting.... I honestly can't get enough of this show. I don't know how it ends and I don't need to to give this anime a 5 star review. Just this intro alone qualifies it as one of, if not the best anime (or show in general!) I have ever seen.",4.5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,I went into this show not expecting very much. I saw the cover art and thought oh looks like a brain dead harem comedy or something. I threw it on to pass the time while I was doing other stuff. It didn't take long before I stopped doing anything else and just sat down to watch. WOW what a great progression in this show. The story and characters really change. By episode 15 it is a total cluster frak of emotions!Watch this show and thank me later!,5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"This show so far is a masterpiece. Which I do not say lightly.The first few episodes may lead you to believe that it's generic boy goes to another world get powers blah blah blah. And while the show does have some of that it goes deeper. The set is just an element of this show. The show isn't about action and adventure. It's about life and death. Violence is a reoccurring theme and it isn't taken lightly. Prepare for heartbreak. If violence bothers you sit this one out.   The characters are so in depth. They are portrayed as people, and like people aren't black and white neither are the characters. Subaru the main protagonist is a perfect example of this. Subaru is so well written and his character is so complex.URGH. I love me some complex characters. Honestly I haven't finished and I'm not sure exactly whats going on but that's the point. Get ready for a wild ride this show does NOT disappoint. Speechless and impressed are two words that come to mind. If you have any reservations or doubts throw them out the window. The tropes in this show (identical twins,elf princesses, hero from another world, magical powers, parallel world) are meant to attract the audience viewer initially but the masterful writing and plot WILL, I repeat WILL, make you stay. Sit through the first bit because it doesn't become apparent until later episodes. Anyway please watch this show. If you like fantasy, grittiness, mystery and nail biters this one is for you.",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"It is better to ignore the reviews and commit to two episodes. The ideas of re:zero may find inspiration from tried and tested story mechanics, yet its presentation gives a fresh compelling experience. It is a lot of fun to watch, breaks genre definition and constantly engaging.A unique prose within anime. Excellent presentation with a rather compelling concept. A lot of unexpected ideas flow within what is otherwise initially perceived as a typical anime.I am really quite impressed. I would not have thought that I'd be hooked on what could be classified as a teenage love drama, thing is it blends in so well with well crafted lore, humour and anime lover's spit. So good. I highly recommend.",5

Just wait for the season to end and binge it. I kind of wish I could have done that but now that I've started I just can't stop.I honestly wasn't expecting much... the premise had me initially throw it into the same category as SAO or Log Horizon (S2), but this really is more akin to Overlord or Gate with how well it's holding me. It's light hearted, upbeat, and cutesy at times, but not afraid to go for the throat and tear your soul to shreds as you wait for next Sunday's episode...",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"I've watched 7 episodes so far and this for me has been the most exciting show for me this year. I find myself longing for Sunday to come around just so I can have my heart ripped apart by the tragedy involved in this show.You may have seen in other comments that this show is being compared to Konosuba and Erased. While both those shows were great in their own right they are in my opinion very different and shouldn't really be compared. Also so far I would say that this show is as good maybe even better so I don't feel similarities matter as you could say they are similar but both could be compared to countless other shows for the same reason people are comparing this one to them.This next bit is just the rough opening story but I get that some people want to go into shows not knowing much at all so click it if you want.Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideThe story revolves around a guy called Subaru who gets sent to a fantasy world for no obvious reason and every time he dies he gets sent back to an earlier point on his timeline. For me this show has all the components to be great. The characters don't feel rushed, the story is entertaining, well developed and for me at least unpredictable, and overall I find this anime very exciting. This show is very gory in stages which I am a fan of and I like that so far the adult rating on MAL is because of the gore rather than because of nudity (don't get me wrong I like fan service, ect.. as much as the next person but it refreshing that a show doesn't need it and instead focuses on the story rather than adding unnecessary scenes for such things to happen in).This show also has elements of action and tragedy along with romance and a little bit of mystery. In the long run it seems quite obvious that relationships are going to develop quite a lot so romance will probably take on a more major role in later episodes.I definitely think most people will enjoy this and so would suggest everyone gives it a try.10/10 so far.",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"Based on first 2 episodes people are comparing this to Erased & Konosuba, but that is like saying Back to the Future is the same as Terminator since they both have time travel in the story. Don't get me wrong, all titles compared are great, but the similarities are only skin deep. They share the premise of an alternate world, A shut in MC and a time travel like reset, but it essentially ends there. The MC of Konosuba is a shut in, but died and was given the choice to enter a parallel world, and is mostly a comedy series. The track suit shut in trope is not original to Konosuba. The MC of Re:ZERO simply hopped over to this parallel world without much fanfare. Also, Re:ZERO has comedy, but is a lot more serious than Konosuba.The MC of Erased goes back in time when an bad event happens, he doesn't have to die for it to trigger & he is also fully aware of it. The MC of Re:ZERO is unaware of it it thus far & it's triggered upon his death and it causes disorientation, likely due to the shock and pain of death. Bottom line, things may look similar at first, but if you look closer you'll find that each stands on their own & Re:ZERO is very interesting so far, it landed a top position in my queue.",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"This series has an interesting take on the isekai genre, throwing out the tropes of an OP MC and the of notions power attainment. This has a mirror in Konosuba, but unlike that series does not use it as a means of comedy. Instead Re:Zero explores how an ordinary man finds his way and creates purpose in a strange, yet rather typical, new fantasy world. The result is series that focuses on character development, with a slow burn on the overall plot progression.",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"Quick Review:(Note: This anime is VERY dark. If you are watching this with the expectation that it will be similar to Konasuba or Danmachi you are not going to be happy.)Plot: 18 Year old Natsuki Subaru appears in fantasy world where he meets a young Half-Elf named Emilia. As the story progresses he realizes that there are ""Save Points"" in which he needs to reach to progress, one wrong move and he will deal with the repercussion of what he has done and sent back to  the previous ""Save Point"". The ""Save Point"" can range any amount of days from the old ""Save Point"", Subaru must endure these deaths to ensure his friends safety and his own survival. Characters: In all honesty, this show has a cast of characters that are AMAZING.Subaru? Shitty MC but the amount of Character Development he gets toward the mid-end season is amazing.Emilia? Great side character, wants to unite the world so that everyone is treated equally. Rem? BEST FUCKING GIRL DON'T @ METhe cast of characters pretty much will have you like this: "" Oh I absolutely hate this character"" *2 Episodes later*""BEST CHARACTER, BEAUTIFUL EXECUTION!""Final Verdict:Re:Zero is an anime i went into with the expectation of hating, and I did at one point. The anime is not necessarily bad, but mid season definitely gets dragged on for reasons I will not explain for the sake of spoilers.Season 2 has been announced yet we have no idea when that will be. But overall like the Title of this review states; It is a great Series, you honestly just need A LOT of patience for our MC to realize his wrongs.",5

rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"What would you do if you had a chance to hit the reset button? Re: Zero starts out like the typical transported to another world anime. Main character otaku/shut-in who is gonna get all the power and all the harems.......Except he doesn't. Even in the first ten minutes of the first episode, the main character Subaru complains about being under-powered. However, he discovers that upon his death he rewinds and resets from a certain point(which changes throughout the show). I find myself relating to Subaru on many different occasions. More times than not his efforts are too little too late. Through many resets he manages to save the heroine and others but..... That's just a small part of what Re: Zero tries to portray. Subaru is a flawed human being who at times, doesn't take others feelings into consideration and it royally screws him over more than once. His suffering and struggling are more emotional and mental than physical. Though if you take into consideration that he has to physically experience dying over and over and over, that's pretty rough as well. Can you imagine watching yourself fail....and then having to relive that experience over again? He adamantly grips onto the idea that his actions are for the better of others when in reality, it's for his own self-gratification. He often doesn't take others feelings into consideration and worse of all.....he can't admit when he is wrong. Very human response and a mistake and issue we have all dealt with once or twice. I feel like too many fans grip onto the idea that the main heroine ""owes"" him her love and kindness because of the things he has done for her. I see the same behavior in real life when people expect that because you are their friend, they should have to date you.  Still, Subaru learns from his mistakes and he grows. He mans up to his problems(after some coaxing and prodding) and pushes forward. As a protagonist, I put him around the same level as Shinji from Neon Genisis. One who despite his flaws and ever-growing trauma still makes the effort. He makes friends, makes allies, and most importantly, he learns what self-sacrifice really is. If your looking for a straight forward, cute anime, probably not for you. The pacing can be a bit odd at times, sometimes slow, and then full throttle at the drop of a pin. One episode is completely composed of dialogue and though I appreciated the sentiment of the episode. I can understand where it might turn people off. The story can jump at times and be slightly confusing if you weren't paying close attention in the early episodes, which can kind of suck. Overall I would say it's not horrible. The characters are pretty inspiring. Even the side characters have good motivation and depth. The animation is well done and artistic. The audio both sub and dub are enjoyable and clean. The plot, if you can follow and stick with it, does have some good points and can really make you feel. Especially if you keep in mind that the protagonist doesn't just hit a reset button. HE HAD to feel the death, which if you have every had a near death experience is terrifying. Overall 4 out of 5. If the pacing and story was a little more coherernt I would give it 5 out 5. Hopefully we see the continuation of the story before long.",4.5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,By far one of the most frustrating animes out there. Don't stop in the middle of it because some parts can be depressive as hell. Either way it has a good story and an unique-ish concept. Hopefully it could get a 2nd season or perhaps a single movie as it still has many ties to connect at the end and you're left inarticulate wondering where the rest of it is. However I doubt they could continue making it even more frustrating as it has been going up from start to finish. Which mean that they would have to come up with a new concept which could either revive or kill the series like in the 2nd series of Sword Art Online where (Spoiler) they weren't at the threat of death at every point which made it rather... Non-serious?,4.5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"The show started out great, and made me love the characters.  Then...Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideAs time went on Subaru's Emilia obsession just got annoying.  His madness got to the point where the episodes weren't enjoyable, but a chore to endure, and then after episode 18 I just wanted to punch him repeatedly.  I ended up watching the show because I enjoyed the supporting and side characters much more than the MC. #PunchSubaru",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"This is a very good anime that is severely hindered by a MC that responds to any situation with only two types of responses. If you can forgive that, then this anime is definitely worth watching. The story and animation is great. The background is well developed. You'll end up liking even the side characters in the story. The authors of these stories really have to stop making every character like Cloud from FF7. Even whiny people, when they go through such hardship as Subaru does, will grow up and develop. Nobody stays the same. If you want to see a good example of how a ""weak"" character can be developed to become important, read Lord of the Rings or watch the movie. You don't have to sabotage their development as people to keep them humble. He does seem to develop slowly, but at a really, really slow pace.",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"Concerning just the production of the anime itself, I loved the art style and characters! There was also a unique balance they struck between the bloody violence and the cutesy scenes; overall a fantastic anime, except... Somewhere around the 12th episode or so you grow to hate the protagonist more than is healthy. The series felt like it was falling apart all the way until the last few episodes; once the protagonist finally sees the err in his ways and the ending story wraps-up, you remember why you fell in-love with the series to begin with. So except for the agonizing stretch of episodes where you grow beyond resentment and resort to a burning hate for the protagonist, this is an incredible overall anime.",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"Current market has so much Isekai that one needs to do something seriously original to stand out from this whole crowd.Here we have main character called Subaru, who despite being called to RPG-like world remains ""normal guy"". As in every anime he has this one strange ability differing him from humans we see every day on the streets, but what stands out is that this ability is absolutely useless in any combat/physical conflict. But also this ability helps him correct his mistakes to some extent... and that element is used perfectly.Subaru is really childish at the beginning of the series. In my opinion his development is the greatest part of this anime, which can be completely missed on the first watch. I decided to watch Re:zero once again - something I don't do very often with anime. I just know that now, knowing social background of characters and direction they will take, this anime will have additional dimension which can be explored.",5

Determined not just for a happy ending, but for a ending of the chaos around him.Re:ZERO is to blame for all the crappy isekai anime we have been getting lately, that I believe to be fact. For the most part though, that is Re:ZERO's only flaw, that it is so good that others are trying way too hard to achieve what Re:ZERO has achieved. With strong writing, fantastic animation, and some of the most beloved anime characters to date.

But I decided to check this anime out, and I was not disappointed. Everything in this anime was perfect, all the characters, story and animation was great! This was just so freaking cool, that I can't even put it into words, how much I like this anime.-Temetsu_98",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"I have one word, WOW.I know that this anime isnt for everyone since some people might find the characters and the plot a bit lacking, and i cant argue with that because thats someone else's opinion, but wow what an emotional rollercoaster this anime was!(Remember this is my opinion, so dont get your nickers up in a tit)From the first episode i was blown away on how great this anime was, as always i just wanted to watch more and more and hear more about this amazing story. Both the art (gore) and the story was something i really didnt expect of this genre, this was a breath of fresh air!I really felt a connection between the characters, why they do what they do, why it turns out like it does. I love the work that has been put into this and it really shows! every single frame of animation, every single soundtrack and every single bit of writing is made with care and is fantastic.The only negative thing i can say is that it takes alot of tries for subaru to get the story going again, but thats just nitpicking!I really praise this anime to get a season two, and i am gonna do everything i can to support this studio to make more! I know the OVA is coming out this year in October, and i cant wait to see more of these great characters! (especially Emilia!, yes thats right i like Emilia more than Rem, deal with it)I have already gone to the conclusion that i want to buy  Tapai Nagatsuki's Light novel of this series (since i have read a bit of the web novel), and I just bought the Blueray Special edition! (I would recommend you doing the same if you want to support this studio!) My final conclusion is that i recommend every single one of you reading this to watch this anime, it isnt a masterpiece, but its very close to that! Please watch it! i can assure you that you WILL enjoy it!And for that...-5/5 SimSand Score",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"This anime has some of the stereotypical tropes of ""boy falls head over heels for girl he doesn't really know but will do anything for"", but this anime does a good job of spinning it in such a way that it is really entertaining to watch. Every character is well developed, and the voice acting is super good and entertaining. Characters are easy to fall in love with, and for those who we don't see much they remain mysterious enough to keep your interest. I am super excited for season 2 and for the future releases of the light novels.",5

This series shattered my expectations beyond what I thought expectations could be shattered by.I watched this series in one sitting, went to bed, then woke up the next day, wanting to watch it again.

Once starting the show I fell in love with the characters and found myself more and more enticed with the plot and the reasonings behind why the characters react the way they do.

Yes, it's just that good. There are so many moments in the middle that felt unbelievably painful to watch as the protagonist fell into darkness, and struggled with himself as a person. Was the outcome pleasant? Does he come out on top the way you want him to? That's for you to decide. You watch it. I hated it so much, but why am I recommending it to you with 5 stars?I'm doing it because there are so many unique characters, and unique moments that happen in this show. I, for one, detest some archetypes, and super typical fanservice scenes that are super cheesy, but this show is a breath of fresh air from all that nonsense. This show is so unique, that I'd even go as far as to say that it's a one of a kind. ""The show has the weirdest pacing, and the dumbest protagonist in the universe. Should I still watch?"" Yes. Absolutely. ""B-b-but you said you had to slug through the middle parts."" Yes, yes I did. ""So should I watch it?"" Yes. ""But you said you didn't like the outcome?""

rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"RE:Zero has earned its place as one of my favorite animes of all time. Theres just something about it. It has that THING I can't quite put a pin on. Maybe the writing was better? Maybe the characters were better developed? Maybe the plot was just too well done? Maybe the music was just too good? Maybe it had some of the greatest animated scenes I've ever seen? I honestly just think its a mixture of all of them.This show starts off as such a typical draw-into-fantasy-world setting that almost made me stop watching, but it becomes so much more. So glad I gave it a chance.Characters. Characters Characters Characters. They make the show. The main characters are all supported by a large cast of extremely well done sides. The protagonist goes through more changes than most. He doesn't always win, he loses hope, he says the wrong thing, he screws up, but it just makes him all the better as a character. You won't see some OP MC that can easily win every engagement in this anime. You will see him develop over the entire season in both good & bad ways.The plot? Hell no. You don't get that. Its great. Go watch it for yourself.",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"This anime starts off in a very stereotypical manner. Our main character is transported to a fantasy realm from Japan, having previously been a nobody (essentially).From here on out however, things quickly diverge from the stereotype. Subaru is not a typical lead, and he is far from a hero who wins despite what is thrown in his path. Through mysterious means, he is granted the power to come back to life after being killed - traveling back in time a short while (which varies), and removing all memory of this from anyone else.With this ability, the premise of the story is set, and the tone is tragic for much of the run. Subaru starts out the story wanting simply to help those around him, and do the right thing - but is incompetent and weak, so is unable to protect anything (not even his own life). He finds those that he cares about in his short time in the new world repeatedly killed, or finds them murdering him due to misunderstandings, only for him to revive and try yet again to find a way to protect what he wants to protect. Doing this for long enough has a toll on his sanity, and he has to find a way to convince others to follow him despite barely knowing him - even those he has died countless times around. He is unable to tell others about his ability as well, as his curse intervenes in any attempt to do so, leading to countless misunderstandings.Subaru's attempts to live with his cruel reality is truly what makes this a great series. The characters he meets are all very unique, and while (sadly) the plot itself is never fully elaborated on (and likely never will be, given this was finished before the source material finished), Re:Zero is still very good as a stand-alone experience.It is not for the faint of heart, and is tragic throughout, but I highly recommend this to just about anyone. Subaru's character growth arc is one of the most compelling of any character arc I've ever seen, anime or otherwise, and for that alone I find this to be worth the time to watch. Look past the cliche, and you might find yourself truly invested in Subaru's struggles in another world.Speaking of which: I suppose it is about time I give this another watch!",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,I just finished the series. Damn. In the 20+ years I've been watching anime I've never had one give and take so much so quickly. I felt like every episode had the ability to make you feel super happy and then suck it all back and left nothing but misery. The emotions are real in this series. The pain is real. You'll find yourself loving all of the characters but at the same time wondering how you havent had a mental break just from watching what Subaru chooses to endure. I shed a few tears. I laughed a lot. I came out happy. Instantly one of my favorites. I highly recommend.,5
jojos-bizarre-adventure,"Jojo's Bizarre Adventure is a curious case, being immensely popular in Japan but only releasing one of its 8 arcs stateside in the entirety of its ongoing 27 year run, and even then only ever having an OVA and a Movie released outside of the manga for the first 25. The brave souls at David Production attempted to adapt this monster of a series, and their efforts were not wasted. The first 2 arcs, Phantom Blood and Battle Tendency, are covered in the first season of the anime, and the creators made sure that the story stayed true to the events and style of the source material. Hirohiko Araki's dramatic style of illustrating sound effects is translated beautifully into the colorful and stylistic world of Jojo, and the plot doesn't stray from the manga like it does in the OVA and Movie. For authenticity alone I give this series a 5/5, but I really enjoy the content within as well and I implore that you give it a try as well. It's not a juggernaut without a reason after all.EDIT: Crunchyroll's subtitles have done a good job preserving the references to other media within the confines of copyright law, which is exciting as a new fan of the series.",5
jojos-bizarre-adventure,"I just finished a marathon of the first season in preparation for the upcoming second, and I could not stop watching. The action is incredible and the story and characters are absolutely ridiculous. Everything about this show is crazy and over the top but at the same time it has a compelling and addictive story.The title says it all really: this is a show that is in equal parts bizarre and adventurous.",5
jojos-bizarre-adventure,"I went into this series wondering, ""Why does everyone love that JoJo anime so much?"" It looked so odd to me. The character designs were weird, the gifs made no sense, and everything about it just screamed, well, bizarre.I finally gave in and began watching JJBA -- and I was forever changed.I totally recommend this anime, as you will love it. It seriously just gets better and better, and your love for the story and the characters deepen with each episode. JJBA is truly an experience. It's an adventure (obviously) and plays out very excitingly, I was never bored.This anime is the first anime I've watched all the way through that has, like, more than 20 episodes. I almost never get hooked on an anime like this, which really says something about how special it is.It took me about 2 months to catch up to where the series is now, and within that time span I have bought JJBA posters, stickers, and I even cosplayed a fem!Jotaro Kujo. That's how far gone I am.So if you are like I once was, wondering what in the world could be SO GOOD about the people named JoJo and their wacky outfits - I ask you to give it a try. You won't be disappointed.",5
jojos-bizarre-adventure,"Alright, so let me begin with just saying that if you look for new shows like I do, a lot of you are probably sitting on the fence right now, looking for a unique reason to watch this particular little title. Let me just stop you right there and say, if you're looking for something truly memorable, something that really makes an impression, something that lasts, then I'd recommend you go ahead and start that first episode right now! If you're not convinced, keep reading. You will be. ;)Now, there are some very large plot points in the show that are consistent throughout, although you may or may not consider them to be rather large spoilers, so only read this section if you don't think you'd mind that.  Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideThe show consists of different, semi-short (around 10 episode from what we've seen so far) arcs, however, each story arc revolves around a different character, all of them being descendents of the Joestar (That's right you heard me), Joestar family. As such the show takes place in different time periods and different parts of the world each arc. Now, a lot of you people are probably thinking ""But Electric0eye-sempai, how can we grow to love a character in only 10 or 20 episodes only for them to be replaced?"" In such case, you'd be right to ask! However! I guarantee that you will grow to love every new character just as much as the last, and within only an episode or two of them appearing! Now with the nasty business of spoilers out of the way, let me also try to define the genre of this shining star for you. If you can imagine Fist of the North Star buying Hellsing Ultimate a drink, going steady, and having a beautiful baby boy, then the animation of this show is more or less the result. As such, every character is pretty much the pinnacle of masculinity to extents you rarely see these days. And trust me, if that's not your thing it will be before long after watching this show. Because with it's gorgeous animation and unique artstyle comes some other tropes, one of which being poses. If you've seen Hellsing Ultimate you probably know what I'm talking about, how you can pause the show at pretty much any point and be met with wallpaper material, imagine that times 20, in which every main character makes a point to pose when doing literally anything, with much appreciated flair. The action is awesome, even to ridiculous levels.  Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideSuch as one of the main characters literally walking up the side of a wall, casually striding as his feet crash into the wall with each step.So if you like your action over-easy, then trust me, I think you'll get a kick out of this. (I'm sorry). The show is also fairly violent, but more in a Hellsing Ultimate zombie-head-smashy kind of way, you might find it pretty hardcore at times if you're not used to animated violence, but if you sat through Hellsing Ultimate or anything of equal measure trust me, you'll be just fine.So that's pretty much it, the short and long version of why you should watch JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. I wrote this because I'd feel too ashamed knowing how much I enjoy this show and not taking the time to share it, so please, enjoy at your leisure. If you haven't yet, then go hit that play button. Trust me, you won't regret it.",5
jojos-bizarre-adventure,"Classic. Dramatic. Revered. Niche.JoJo does it all — with style. Besides the absurd amount of cultural references both eastern and western JoJo's ground-breaking success in Japan should speak for itself.Until recently the only thing keeping it from being successfully publicized in the west is the author's love of western music, which is translated into various namesakes through the series.",5
jojos-bizarre-adventure,"I need to say that JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is one of the most amazing series that I have been able to watch lately. It's story and excitement for each and every episode just keeps the watchers entertained until they are going to watch through the whole series, and even possibly start with Manga if they are unable to wait any longer for new episodes.StorylineThe story, as many of you may have already noticed, is mainly focused around the Joestar bloodline as they struggle to battle their nemesis DIO!!. Each part of the story has always something to do with him, and so, it's quite interesting to see how the story intervines with these two. JoJo's Bizarre Adventure has a story in which even the main character can die, as seen with the first part - Phantom Blood. I would rate the story top-notch, with many interesting twists, and so on.Review The one thing I love the most about JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is the way the characters battle their opponents. They don't do it simply through plot-armor, and stuff like that, but they actually use their brain to fight. Many of the opponents even think logically, and tend to be geniuses which provide the characters they battle with great struggles.Furthermore, in order to win a fight, a character always needs to use the full potential of their Stands and powers in order to defeat the opponent. And that's mostly why I love the action in JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. That action is also supported by the epic punch-lines, excitement, and unpredictability which comes from it.Another thing I love about the series is that no matter what gender the main character is, the mascunality just sky-rockets off the walls with their actions and ambitions. In the series, you will meet many heart-breaking and heart-warming times with several characters shedding manly tears at times!All in all, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is something you need to watch, and you need to watch every part, read manga, everything that has to do with it. It is time well-spent, trust me, I am a doctor.",5

I knew he was just jealous for my devotion of JoJo. I called him a cunt. He slaps me and sends me to go to sleep. I'm crying now and my face hurts. I lay in bed and it's really cold. A warmth is moving towards me. I feel something touch me. It's Jotaro. I'm so happy. He whispers in my ear, ""Sabaku no wa ore no stando da!"". He grabs me with his powerful Star Platinum hands, and puts me on my hands and knees. I spread my ass-cheeks for Jotaro. He penetrates my butthole. It hurts so much, but I do it for Jotaro. I can feel my butt tearing as my eyes start to water. I push against his force. I want to please Jotaro. He roars a mighty roar, as he fills my butt with his love. My dad walks in. Jotaro looks him straight in the eye, and says, ""Yare Yare Daze"". Jotaro leaves through my window. JoJo is love. JoJo is life.﻿",5
jojos-bizarre-adventure,"Jojo's Bizarre Adventure is a fusion of satire and typical shonen. Many of the one to three star reviewers seem to believe the show is stereotypically shonen, like Bleach or Naruto. Hirohiko Araki, the creator, made Jojo to parody the hyper masculine series that ruled the anime genre in the 80's, namely Fist of the North Star. While people are calling it sexist they miss out on the fact that half the cast is wearing overly flamboyant clothing and striking poses that would make a Victoria's Secret model do a double take. Here are hyper masculine men, six feet tall, built like walls, posing like they're Catwoman on the cover of a Frank Miller comic book.This all isn't to say the show doesn't also revel in its roots. Of course there's going to be shonen action, that's how they contrast the posing, art style, and character actions. For some people it's plodding and I get that, but the people saying this ""makes Bleach look elegant"" simply have no idea. And I don't mean that offensively, I mean they quit before they could realize what the series is about. If you like a good laugh, over the top villains with over the top heroes in overly climactic battles that constantly raise the stakes to ludicrous proportions, with some decent nudge nudge wink wink trope comedy, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is what you want.",5

jojos-bizarre-adventure,"you would expect something goofy and over the top. It definitely covers the latter but this show is anything but goofy. Stellar action scenes and little bits of humor make this show a joy to watch. Though, the over the top nature can be a double edged sword at times. There are some scenes which feel too dramatic and feel drawn out and long. A minor complaint at best since it doesn't happen a lot. The art style looks old school which makes sense considering the manga series was started in the late 80's. Overall good show.",5

jojos-bizarre-adventure,"I was old school.  I thought Bebop, FLCL, and Evangelion were the best.  Let's throw Ruroni Kenshin and Ranma 1/2 in there for good measure (maybe you're nostalgic like me).  I was wrong.  There's nothing that's gripped me at 27 years old like this one.  It has the same pitfalls as any great anime: impossible comebacks, unrealistic time-stopping moments, and truly strange instances of perfect prediction by protagonists in the nick of time.  But that's almost exactly what makes it great.  10/10 series, and my new and most favorite show.  It's the feel-good version of every anime you've ever enjoyed.  It's the Die Hard of arthouse anime.  Give it a shot.",5
jojos-bizarre-adventure,"To be completely honest I hated the first arc of this show (which ends episode 9).  The first JoJo just completely pissed me off and his fighting with Dio was way to half-assed.  I was going to drop this anime because of that.  When I got to episode 10, however, I became aware of the fact that this anime tells the story of different generations of JoJos.  Now that I know that it is far more interesting and I love it all. TLDR; Once you get to the 2nd arc you'll be hooked.",5
jojos-bizarre-adventure,"TL;DR: JoJo snowballs into becoming an AMAZING anime. Watch it. If you aren't convinced:+ Kills off characters, making fights unpredictable+ Hilarious, but easily takes a serious tone+ Memorable characters (after part 3 this really takes shows)+ Amazing fights+ Actual tension. Puts JoJo ahead of even Dragon Ball (you know that the Z fighters will win 90% of the time)+ Spectacular soundtrack+ Follows a bloodline of badasses- Part 1 is an obstacle for new watchers, as it's boring, and not as good as the rest of the series.",5

jojos-bizarre-adventure,"EDIT: When I finished part 1 of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure i was confused as to how the story will continue, but once part 2 was released this show regained my confidence. The Third Part thats currently being aired had such an amazing start. For some reason it feels like the blood, and gore gets much more bloodier as the show goes on, but as I re-watched the show with some of my family I realized that the blood and gore is a signature trait for the JoJo Series. I love where this series is going, and it truly feels like an adventure because after the first season there are many places they travel to, and they always keep moving. There has been no dull episodes, any episode with little action usually has some important dialogue to introduce to the plot. I honestly believe this and Hunter x Hunter are the CURRENTLY hypest shows on Crunchyroll. I started reading the manga on my own accord, and did not regret it. Every single JoJo is a badass, and i mean EVERY JOJO.Have fun with this MASTERPIECE. i know i did, and still am thanks to Crunchyroll.i hope one day that Crunchyroll brings in all the hidden gems that Japan has been hiding from us.(:",5
jojos-bizarre-adventure,"I had heard about jojo  from multiple sources, including a video of the game which proved its hilarious insanity. when I started this anime I expected it to be nothing more than fabulous people doing fabulous poses, while I cant say it is not that, I can say its more. behind the odd outer shell has a brilliant story and epic concept behind the sires. I recently read the manga, and after doing so I found it hard to understand how It was the same jojo sires part after part? it had the same concepts, but how the stories are written are completely altered as while part 3 is an adventure packed with nonstop action, the 8th part can hardly be classified as action and is more of a mystery tale that's occasional battles feel like a Zelda boss with a puzzle like nature . The anime adaptation has been brilliant so far, properly adding the pizzaz and style intended by the creator and being able to properly adapt the storys well also. if you choose to pass on this sires, then you don't have any clue what you are missing.",5
jojos-bizarre-adventure,"Jojo's Bizarre Adventure is a manga series that started way back in 1987, and took it until 2012 to get an anime adaptation that Hirohiko Araki, the author, actually liked. The story is about a chain of events that spans hundreds of years that start when the villainous Dio Brando shows up at Jonathan Joestar's house in England and makes a mess out of his life. That doesn't sound very bizarre, but Dio manages to become a vampire, and starts trying to take over the world for no good reason. That's only part one of the currently eight-part series, but so far only parts 1, 2, and 3 have been animated. Onto the actual review: Jojo's Bizarre Adventure is characterized by it's unique, quirky nature and well-thought out fights. The animation might be merely okay, but it is put off by the colorful and extravagant artstyle of the anime. Part 1 is very short, but it's key setup for what's to come in Part 3. Part 2 follows Jonathan's grandson, Joseph, as he fights nearly naked Aztec Vampire men with dubstep theme songs. Part 3 might be the most famous, and it explores Jotaro--Joseph's grandson--and his efforts to travel to Egypt from Japan in order to defeat a mysterious individual who is responsible for his mother getting an incurable fever. Also Part 3 introduces ""Stands"", manifestations of spirits who fight alongside their users.The soundtrack also works amazingly well with the setting, and a different composer males different music for each part. Part 1 takes place in 1880's England, so the music is very orchestral and fancy. Part 2 is in the 1930's and Joseph travels all over the place, so the music tries to fit his personality: laid-back, yet knows when to get going. Speaking of personality, the characters have very simple personalities for the most part, and the focus is more on the fights, the story, and the adventure of it all.Definitely check this out if you're looking for a serious yet weird fighting series with high energy and enjoyability, but can mind if the characters can be a bit shallow. In parts 1-2, the characters not named Jojo or Zeppeli barely even do anything other than narrate! But if you like a mostly linear series, than be warned that Part 3 isn't necessarily very linear, except in the sense that it's just a series of fights with a journey to Egypt from Japan in the background. The fights are very entertaining and creative, though. And those issues surrounding Part 3 and how it seems like a grind at some moments might be fixed in the (at the time, upcoming) anime.",5

jojos-bizarre-adventure,"I could gush on how much I love JoJo, and I really, really do, however, after conducting a short survey of all these reviews, I've figured out how newcomers should watch this anime. Try to push through Part 1. Yes, I know it can seem to be cliched, but keep in mind that JoJo's Bizarre Adventures wrote a lot of those cliches to begin with. By the time you reach the end of Part 1 (Episode 9), you would have either fallen in love (which makes this review redundant), absolutely hated it (that's okay, you can leave saying you gave it a shot), or, if you were like me; you haven't found your true love in anime form, but you wouldn't be opposed to watching a little more (just to see were it's all going). If you are in the last category, do your best to push through Part 2. Part 2 will be the part that makes or breaks this anime for you. Hell, you can walk away from this show after Part 2 feeling pretty satisfied, whether or not you decide to watch Part 3. For me, it created an obsession that I may never get over. My highest recommendations.",5
jojos-bizarre-adventure,"This is one of the funniest and coolest anime I know at the moment. Seeing these macho characters at it in their fights is truly a work of arts. Their voices and are really entertaining, as you follow the story of the JoJo family bloodline, they are all very badass main characters. The character development is very interesting and each season has almost a completely different feel in terms of their battles, but always very interesting.Definitely worth a watch.",5
jojos-bizarre-adventure,"I just got into this anime a week ago and I've all ready completely all three season and now waiting for the four one to come out. This is the greatest anime I've ever seen! It has everything you could want comedy, action, posing, blood, and like everything you can think of and it does it in a way that makes it all work out somehow. I will say however don't just go in and base it off the first one or two episodes. The anime does take sometime to really kick into gear but one it does you're going to be in for a ride. Like I said before I just got into this show and I'm talking about it to all of my friends and telling them to watch it just like I am telling you, the reader. You just need to go in and watch it. Watch it to at least the second half of the first season it gets better in the second half. So just go already. Why are you still here? GOOO!!!!",5
jojos-bizarre-adventure,"I've picked this anime after a friend suggested it. The first episode was good enough for me to keep watching. You get hooked to this universe rather fast. It grows on you, and you fall in love with it. I know it's really over the top most of the time, but that's what I like about it. Every episode is something new and exciting. Music is on point, animation is on point. Possibly one of the best anime shows I've seen in a while. I recommend that you give it try. Following the Joestar family is probably one of the best decisions I've ever made.",5
jojos-bizarre-adventure,"The less you know about JoJo's Bizarre Adventure going into it, the better.Start with the first episode of the first arc.  You won't know exactly what to think at first.  The plot elements, the designs, and the hyper-masculinity all seem like they were taken from another time, and in fact they were.JoJo's Bizarre Adventure has unique intensity that never lets up, even when things get, well, BIZARRE. The plot starts out relatively mundane but quickly escalates in a way that stretches and then threatens to snap suspension of disbelief. You might at times think you're watching a parody, but while JJBA is very often funny, it is also deadly serious action.The characters are all relatively simple but enjoyable.  Everything is turned up to 11, the pure evil of the villains, the manly virtues of the heroes, the clothing, the poses, the action, the music.  JoJo has a prog rock spirit that never quits and a unique style that has been referenced countless times by other series.  You'll find yourself wanting to watch more long before you ""get"" it, and then ""it"" changes yet again.I for one hope that the ride never ends, I've enjoyed every minute.",5
jojos-bizarre-adventure,"Unlike any anime I have ever seen. Just the art style combined with the unique storytelling and fantastic fights. Each episode I looked forward to, as I just went through a huge marathon with the series. Can't wait for the new season this month. Absolutely incredible. I would highly recommend. One of my favorite series.Plus, this motivated me to go back to the gym, out of envy. Like in the title, the show is just the essence of manliness. If I owned a gym, I would constantly be playing this show on all the TVs. Don't believe me/think I'm crazy? Watch the show.",5
jojos-bizarre-adventure,"When I first start watching this anime I was a little skeptical.  I knew the manga had a big following but wasn't sure how the execution of this was going to go.  Well let me tell you one thing, they did a FANTASTIC JOB.  The anime is the perfect combination of Manliness and Poses.  It's a story that you'll love,  You instantly get addicted to the animation style and the voice acting is spot on.  There's nothing more I can say about this.  It's become one of my favorites easily.  I would rate JoJo's Bizarre Adventure a 10/10.  Definitely a must watch if you enjoy anime, great stories, and poses.",5
jojos-bizarre-adventure,"JoJo's Bizarre Adventure starts off with a premise of Johnathan Joestar's conflict with his stepbrother, Dio Brando. Leading from Victorian-era England all of the way up to the currently adapted part of the anime, Stardust Crusaders.JoJo's is a rather likeable series due to the cast of characters and the events during the plot that unfold. It's somewhat of a tour de force to really enjoy from beginning to end. I feel that the series as a whole animated is beautifully done, and I really hope to see the further parts post Stardust Crusaders animated. I highly, highly recommend this series due to the amazing world of Hirohito Araki being fleshed out and animated on the television screen. It's one of the legendary mangas of our time, and I hope we get to see more as time passes on.",5
jojos-bizarre-adventure,"I call this a MANime.. manly anime. I'm not saying its for guys because I'm a chick and love this type of series, its more of same vein as series like Beserk, bastard, etc. I instantly loved the series though the artwork took some getting use to, the SC season has grown on me. Only because I didn't like Jotaro as much as I liked Joseph, but serious this is such a fun anime to watch. Few series in the last couple years have gotten me as excited and anxious to watch them  like when I first got into anime, and this is one of them. its just a fun, great series.. with some cool problem solving Elements Great music too! *lick*lick*lick*lick*lick*lick*lick*",5
jojos-bizarre-adventure,"I would recommend this for men seeking a role model of sheer manliness. At the same time, I would recommend this anime for girls looking for some serious ""eye candy,"" since this anime is overflowing with very robust healthy young men. Besides all the external glamour, this anime is comprised of a very captivating story line along with a adrenaline rush of very gory action scenes. Be advised, there will be zombies, vampires, a Man killing robot, beautiful women, and very handsome looking men in this anime. Brace yourself for one heck of a ""bizarre"" adventure.",5
jojos-bizarre-adventure,"The legendary manga created by the legendary mangaka Hirohiko Araki finally receives an anime adaptation! JoJo's Bizarre Adventure arguably the most influential manga of all time. Moreso than Dragon Ball! It isn't merely it's gorgeous artwork that makes it shine, but it's also the diverse storytelling it has. Each arc has a new main character with a new storyline in order to keep the series fresh. The first arc is a Victorian Gothic horror, but later on the second arc has the air of a light-hearted action flick. The third is an epic adventure that combines Journey to the West with Bram Stoker's Dracula. The fourth a Persona-ish hunt for supernatural criminals in a small Japanese town, the fifth an Italian mafia war, the sixth a jailbreak story, the seventh a horseback race across the continental United States, and the eighth a supernatural mystery following the destruction left by the 2011 Touhoku EarthquakeNot only do I highly recommend the manga, but this anime series presented by David Production is one of the most faithful adaptations of a manga that I have ever seen. You can tell that the production team and each of the seiyuu who are a part of this production grew up with JoJo and are hellbent and making an anime that does the series justice.In short, JoJo is awesome. Now WATCH IT!",5
jojos-bizarre-adventure,just. yes.i decided i finally needed to write a review so uhi'd really just like to say that the bad reviews don't make sense?? saying that jojo is boring and has no character development is completely false &&& i guarantee that anyone who disagrees with me hasn't even watched the first season in its entirety. give it time!! sometimes you need to get pretty far into a show before you really start to enjoy and appreciate it (:,5
jojos-bizarre-adventure,"Jojos bizarre adventure will take on a roller coaster or experiences from amazing and some times sad and serious. The level of writing and creativity the series undergoes continues to increase in quality as you progress through the parts. The powers and action of the show cannot be done justice in just words but ill try. Battles are very entertaining and will sometimes blow you away.Definitely one of the most unique shows here on this site, but it isn't for everyone. One major downside of the show is the inconsistency of the original writer Hirohiko Araki. In the original manga especially in the later parts, his writing style can get unpredictable and random. Which can make or break moments in the show, for the most part, it makes it. But when doesn't it sticks out, and it's even more noticeable in the anime. This is not the fault of david productions but rather Araki himself.",5
jojos-bizarre-adventure,"This show took my life away from me.I mean it, there is no show like it or any that come even close. The fights are amazing, each one is packed with un-raveling the enemies abilities and strengths. Once you get through the first 9 episodes, you cant stop. If u rlly rlly rlly cant bear the first or second parts (I happen to love part 2 bc Joseph is amazing but part 1 can be boring) you could, but I warn you not to cause you are really missing a lot, skip to part 3. If you even tell any jojo fan about this, they will MUDA MUDA you to death because u are now a part skipper. But for real, watch this anime its so amazing in every way. The character development is amazing, the fights are amazing. THE POSES ARE EVEN AMAZING. It is truly bizarre how good this is.",5

jojos-bizarre-adventure,"The series evolves as Araki realizes what works and what doesn’t, as such there are some issues you may have with different parts.Part 1 Phantom Blood, the first 9 episodes, will cause a lot of people to stumble because it’s generic in ways,  the constant descriptions of people’s attacks, and the way characters are drawn is a little too masculine for most, but I highly encourage watching all 9 episodes (even if it’s after watching other parts) because it lays the foundation of the series.Part 2 Battle Tendency, is much better for most people. The characters are still piles of pure muscle, but the fights feel more exciting, Hamon is expanded upon and Joseph feels a lot more clever than Jonathan. This part is what caused me to become a JoJo fan.Part 3 Stardust Crusaders is where I struggled a bit, the introduction of stands messed me up. It went from being manly men punching each other to stands punching each other. Stand were a new thing so Araki didn’t really know what to do with them yet so many of them were essentially “punching ghosts”. Again I recommend continuing with this part even if you find it not to be for you since you’ll be more used to stands and I honestly enjoyed the part when it was over.Part 4 Diamond is Unbreakable, this is where Araki makes stands much more interesting. Without spoiling too much I’ll give the Main character’s stand ability and a side character’s stand ability  Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideMain JoJo’s stand can fix things and a side character can make people feel an unbearable weight of guilt if they think they’ve wronged him. these are very different from what we saw in part 3 even if JoJo is still using a stand that feels like a punching ghost at times. We also see a lot more of “attack the stand user” rather than the stand. So even if the character is attacking with their stand, they are still fighting as far as we the audience are concerned.Part 5 Golden Wind is where we see Araki’s art style become much more defined, and of course, stands continue to be very interesting. It’s the most popular part in Japan and I don’t think there’s much I need to say on how it feels enjoyable to watch or read.Part 6 Stone Ocean is not adapted into an anime as of my writing this but I’ll leave a comment on it. This is the first and probably only female JoJo, and it’s an interesting change of pace. I don’t think the part was bad, but I feel like it could have been better, some fights did suffer from the over description issue. Part 7 Steel Ball Run is the part I am currently reading. So far I have found it rather enjoyable as it feels so wildly different from the previous parts. Stands feel almost like hamon abilities in this part, which makes me very happy. It also feels like a remake of Phantom Blood in a way since it shares many character names despite being so different.Part 8 JoJolion obviously I have no comment as of yet.",5
jojos-bizarre-adventure,Most of these long running anime series like  ONE PIECE the main character gets stronger and stronger until he is unbeatable and after some time they get boringNO JOJO'S BIZARRE ADVENTURE every single part has a new main character. Sometimes they are stronger than the other sometimes they are weakerJojo always has a new main character so it never and I mean  never gets dryJojo is exciting and has a good storyClear 11/10,5
jojos-bizarre-adventure,"Part 1 may be slow, but if you can get through it, you'll be rewarded with one of the greatest anime ever made. The plot may be lacking at times, but it more than makes up for it with its style, humor, characters, and uniqueness. Watching through JoJo, I can understand why it's so influential. The animation is (mostly) amazing, the voice acting is phenomenal, the character and Stand designs are colorful and wild, the pacing is at breakneck speed, and it's a great balance between humor and violence. Just a reminder: this is not a typical Shonen where characters can just punch and blast their way out of every fight. Similar to Hunter x Hunter and the Nen system, characters (both heroes and villains) must constantly outwit their enemies and think on their feet. Not only that, but the parts are so varied that there's bound to be something you'd like. Each part and each JoJo is so different and unique from one another that sometimes you'll be wondering whether your watching the same show or not. I implore you to give it a try. I was skeptical for a long time but after watching it, it has become my favorite anime of all time.",5
jojos-bizarre-adventure,"Grab some popcorn, tonight you'll be staying up until 6:00 AM watching. JoJo's Bizarre Adventure starts as your average vampire-family issue story, with a courageous hero learning techniques to battle the supreme villain. But as soon as I finished episode 9 and started number 10, something was off. Something very off. The new protagonist hit me like a bullet. I started watching. It was almost like a thirst. It was 10:00 PM; No problem, I can go through 5 more episodes(don't do that). Joseph Joestar is a trickster and much less of a courageous goody two shoes here. He is quirky and uses old techniques in new ways.Something was missing though.I started part 3.I found what was missing.STANDSStands are the physical manifestations of a person's soul. These fights woke me and forced my eyes to hurt as I saw 10 poses consecutively, but the more poses you see, the more you like them. It's sort of like a growing fetish *cough* AHEM, back to the subject. Stands introduced many different abilities. The fights were very entertaining and this was no longer a regular vampire anime. IT IS A LEGENDARY ANIME.Alright, part 4 goes sort of like this:Bunch of Morioh side stories and character introductions.BOOMYeah everything's like horrifying nowAnyways, part 4 is a masterpiece by the time you finish. It just needs a little time to catch up.Part 5:Giorno and his gang pose like mad lads and beat up this 60's kid because he's too lame to be at the top of an organization.It's not even remotely about vampires anymore. It's more of a pose-fest with the best fights of anime history mixed in.100/10Warning: If you watch this show, you may start noticing everyone around you has trash taste.Thank youNOW WATCH IT",5
jojos-bizarre-adventure,"After watching a few YouTube videos about JoJo and how much you should watch it, I decided to do so. Slowly I watched the Re-Edited versions of part 1 and 2. At first I didn't get what all the hype was about. JoJo was good, but I found myself being bored with the longevity and repetition of he show, especially in the first part of part 3. But then the other part hit. I found myself binge-watching JoJo. The fights started to get more interesting and I started to get more invested. I finished part 3. I wanted more. I then watched the entirety of part 4 in 3 days. 3 DAYS. Let's do some math. There is 39 episodes of JoJo part 4. Each episode is about 23 minutes. 39*23 = 897. Divide that by 60 (to turn minutes to hours) and you get about 14,95 hours. So 15 hours. I watched 15 hours of JoJo in 3 days. THAT'S 5 HOURS OF JOJO PER DAY. That is how much i loved the show. I quickly catched up to part 5 and when i was done i felt myself in a state of restlessness. What was i suposed to do now????? JoJo has captured my heart and is sure to catch yours. When you make it through the ""boring"" parts it will be so worth it. I'm now reading the manga from start to finish. After that i'm gonna re-watch JoJo, cuz i just can't get enough. JoJo isn't just an anime. JoJo is a lifestyle",5
jojos-bizarre-adventure,I love absolutely everything about this show. I joined the hype train after part 4 finished up and quickly caught up because I just couldn't stop watching it. Part 5 has a special place in my heart since I can finally have a real show to look forward to every week. Though it's hard to talk about because everyone just sees it as another crappy anime and doesn't watch it. It's very frustrating to sit there and know my friends haven't seen the greatness that is Jojo's Bizzare Adventure,5
jojos-bizarre-adventure,"This franchise is the best thing I’ve ever laid eyes on, not just as a Japanese animation, but as a show in general. Even if you read the manga, watching the anime feels like an entirely new experience and has all sorts of twists and turns despite being extremely loyal to the original work. As the title suggests, the show is very bizarre and you see that in the very beginning, but you get so drawn in that everything feels so natural and normal. You barely even notice the plot holes because of how invested you are. Well, that gets me to the main negative argument about this show. If you really pay attention, you can notice multiple plot holes here and there. And that’s fine, because this is a show that you see through and go “I really enjoyed that”. They’re not negative enough to ruin the whole show for you. Every part follows a new protagonist and setting, which is like witnessing an entirely new show but following the same path. I’ve heard arguments that people only like it because of how unique it is, but I don’t find it a bad thing. In fact, I believe it genuinely gives us a new sense of reaction that we’ve never felt before which is why we always strive for more, and continue to go back to Jojo to see it once again. You can revisit this show multiple times and the emotion is just as impactive, if not more. I definitely recommend almost everyone to check out this show, there’s guarantee something you’d satisfyingly settle with due to all the variety of genres. Don’t even get me started on the community, they’re the most charming people you’ll ever see. The memes and jokes run so deep that once you get them, it feels almost satisfying and rewarding to get to this point. It’s  also not as cringy like most popular shows, so you can keep it at your own low community to enjoy.",5

that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"As a big fan of isekai shows, I have succumb my self to a lot of trashy ones. Among the harems and OP thick headed MCs, there are several that stand out as legitimately good shows. Shows like Overlord and Konosuba stand out because they break the standard tropes of isekai, which brings me to this show. That Time I Got Reincarnated As A Slime or TIGRAS for short, despite seemingly a harem show actually really isn't. The manga was very focused on the world building and how Rimuru would change how monsters and humans would live. This gives a realistic sense of how one would try to create a peaceful world of monsters and men. I love the low key message of braking racial barriers in order to create a utopia. With a good story that's basically the opposite of Overlord, the manga made the world of TIGRAS seem more alive than a lot of other isekai. Also the action scenes were badass in the manga so I can't wait to see them in the show.",4.5
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"I can usually tell within 5 minutes into a show if it's worth anything and I have to say this one didn't disappoint me at all. Yes, it's old theme, 'reincarnation into alternate game-like universe, but it's done properly. All those complaining about it being a repeat theme aren't using their brain, 'everything you watch is a repeat theme and the only thing that matters is that it's done right and this one is definitely done right'.Keep watching, it won't let you down!",5
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"I really really love this show! The MC is overpowered, smart, adorable and a badass! I just love how this show is progressing.. Please don’t let this end too quickly. I want to watch more about Rimuru’s adventures and i want to see his little goblin village grow even more. I love the characters, they are all interesting and lovable. I can’t get enough of this super awesome anime!!! Great job to the people who made this. Thank you so much!",5
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"The Isekai (or ""In another world"") genre isn't new to anyone that's been watching anime for any length of time. Every season there's always at least two new spins on the popular genre, most of them adding nothing new or interesting to what already exists.Slime Datta Ken (or ""Reincarnated as a Slime"") changes up the existing formula quickly. Whereas some of the normal Isekai tropes exist, they are often used differently to other shows.As a quick example to show this, most Isekai protagonists gain extraordinary power or unique skills in order to put them on the level of some kind of ""Hero"" which then allows them to take on a demon lord, conquer the world, or laugh in the face of any competition. Slime Datta Ken gives us a protagonist that gains these powers, but instead of doing anything like previous protagonists of the genre, his only goal is to create a city/country that is safe for those monsters that have been abused for so long.Perhaps I'm not giving the plot justice with that statement. But I do urge you, whomever decides to read any of this, to give this show the ""3 Episode"" treatment. Just watch the first three episodes, if you're not hooked just move on (until someone inevitably tells you that ""it gets a lot better!"").-- I give the plot a solid 5/5 --That said. For those that care about other background ambiance:The animation is crisp, almost everything is drawn, and CGI is used sparingly on background scenery that you could only notice if you're trying.The music and sound choice is fantastic and really fits into the tone of the show. I don't think I have anything else to say about it.That said, I do think that the OP perhaps spoils a bit too much given that much of the stuff it shows probably won't be happening until its second cour (13th-24th episodes).-- I give the animation and sound designs a 4.5/5And that's why I gave this show a 5/5.I urge anyone reading this to give this show a chance, it won't disappoint you.",5
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"I have read the manga and light novel for a very long time so when I heard about this series getting an anime I was very excited! I have spent my morning being bored with nothing to watch or do and now that this has come I can enjoy watching anime again and it's a funny enjoyable adventure. The beginning was exciting and had 'life' or motion in it's detail of events. What's more the coloring is bright and colorful which fits the art style and the story events so far have been following the novel and the animation didn't cut out critical details which are necessary for the animation to be able to tell it's story properly. What's even more exciting and making me give a 5 star is that the animation has brought 'Emotion' or movement into the characters the way they express themselves are smooth and fit their development as character personality. The action they preform are not cut or short but detailed and you can tell what they are feeling and understand it without needing insight to it. Especially the Slime Rimuru! The animation was spot on with giving emotion to a mass of gelatin and actually made him seem adorable and life like! Its a great way to express his emotions and actions! The storyboard is also quite well done as the story line is following the details of the story line without cutting out to critical details which carries most of the intent of the story and this expresses clearly! The story wasn't moved at a rapid pace and lost many details which make it fun, but instead kept the story telling details,which as a novel reader of this series personally enjoy, but the animation gave movement to the character and gave 'body' to it's character with personality, movement of his or her expression, and keeping the setting and expression of it's environment and coloring it's a really enjoyable anime! I hope this animation continues on for a long time and I hope they keep up this quality of animation! It's getting more popular over time and with this animation style, story telling without being rushed, art with emotion and expression, and the effort and time they put into this series, I'm sure that many people will be re watching this series and enjoy the new episodes for many Episodes to come! My only hope is that it will have a large enough fan base for the animation company to continue this series and give more seasons for the fans to enjoy and MOST IMPORTANTLY! To keep the quality of the animation, and story telling as it is in the first 3 episodes I have seen so far!",5
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"I haven't written a review before, and its especially odd to pick a show with just one episode so far as a starting point, but man am I exited for this one! The movement and animation for the characters have been very fluid and well executed, and the story is really neat and interesting too. As it is commonly known, slime are just low-level, easily defeated monsters in most any rpg, but having one be sentient and knowledgeable and having cool skills? That is cool enough in its own right. Combined with the animation so far, I just have to say, I'm excited for this one.",5
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"This anime nails everything that is interesting about issekai.1.) Starting premise is tragically believable, based on a dying wish.2.) The protagonist's dying wish is answered and they start an amazing adventure in an honest and simple way.3.) The pace of adding characters is spot on with good introductions, although I'd love to know a bit more about the Ogres.4.) Animation is excellent.5.) Touching connections to humanity in our world.6.) The antagonist is dark and shrouded at the moment, so I love learning about them along with the protagonist. I'm hoping for something more than a good guy/bad guy plot, and a bitter-sweet ending would totally be in theme for this anime. Even if the bad guy is an uncomplicated bad guy for the sake of being bad, the journey has been so fun this far, I could totally overlook it.7.) Slimes are finally having their day in the sun!!!!!!! Someone finally recognized how versatile slimes could be, mixed in with a little intelligence and BOOM! So awesome!! Would love to actually play a video game like this.I could keep going.",5
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"I mean it just is.  It's an enjoyable show for what it is, but at the end of the day it's nothing memorable and it doesn't have much rewatch value to it at all.It starts out with a really interesting premise of what's essentially a loser in our world being reincarnated as the weakest monster of another world, then immediately shoots that premise in the foot at the end of the first episode.  Rimuru immediately turns into slime jesus/mary sue incarnate as he goes around the world facing hyped up threats that always end with anticlimactic resolutions.  The high production values make it a fun watch regardless, but nothing ever goes wrong for Rimuru since he has the ""Great Sage"" to fill him in on anything he doesn't know.  The show has a really lighthearted feel to most of it which makes it a real easy watch, but it can be hard to hold the interest of some when there is basically no tension or conflict whatsoever.- It tries to position itself as a civilization development show at times, but then Rimuru doesn't do much in regards to doing so as it just.....happens.- It tries to position itself as a show that supports diplomacy, but it represents a level of political structure that a 10 year old might have an understanding of.  (Seriously, any threatening enemy just turns into a friend almost immediately)- It tries to position itself as an action show at times, but most fights devolve into onesided curbstomps with long foregone conclusions.  - It tries to position itself as a show with rich characters, but most characters are one-dimensional trope fulfillment mannequins as if the writer was going down a checklist.At the time of this review the main story has finished, which is why I waited to say anything about it.  I know that many of the novel readers are trying to hype up a second season saying that things get ""Dark""....but it really doesn't.  As a novel reader I can say that this is a story that was never meant to take itself too seriously, which is rather unfortunate that past volume 5 (Past the timeline of the anime) it then retroactively tries to start taking itself seriously, which comes off as REALLY dumb.It's an enjoyable show for what it is, and it is certainly worth the initial viewing.  Just don't go in expecting a riveting ongoing plot and a fully fleshed out cast, because it just doesn't happen.",5
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"It is a good anime. I wish there was more to the story and not so much easily seen foreshadowing. Many of the plot points can be seen an episode or two in advance. The story is really rushed and there is no character development. I would have to say this is a decent anime. The characters seem to be general stereotypes. The irony is that it points it out and to minor comedic effect. I would say this is an anime for a younger audience age range 6-15. The one question i have is why did he not run into other slimes.The animation is great and matches the target age group. It is a show i would be okay watching with a family around. I found most of the art work to be spot on. Over all it would be something I wouldn't mind watching it. I would give a 3.25 if I could, 3 is a little harsh but 4 is a bit too much.",5
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"I loved this anime.... until I didn't. In the beginning this anime did a lot of things correctly. This anime created a cool and interesting world. We as an audience learned about the world as Rimuru learned about the word. The anime also had some side slice of life stuff that all leads to an interesting mid season finale. Now with the new characters added in, it makes for a boring show. The tension and purpose is gone.  Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideWhen you introduce less powerful demon lords that Rimuru easily handles the story becomes pointless. Also Rimuru has little to no competition after he beats the first demon lord.   Would recommend till the mid season finale. After that episode it feels like the author lost all direction.",5
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"A show where a character (Rimiru) dies in the real world and is reborn in another one as a slime, the classic RPG monster. This character begins their journey by becoming incredibly powerful and gathering the tools necessary to overcome the challenges presented to them. They go on to help the world form into a larger, more peaceful society that reflects Rimiru's great deeds.The animation quality is excellent, and there is a markedly high amount of inventive world-building, which is executed very well.However, this show has very little tension, drama, or conflict. This is done on purpose. The characters are heavy-handed to an unrealistic degree, in comparison to the protagonist, whose personality is not developed enough to create a conflict - and, in turn, neither are any of the other characters'. When the small, or even large issues do arise, they are solved by the protagonist in an immediate and simple way.A story needs a conflict, and this one is built not to have it. There is a lack of substance here that is accepted at face value, which is absolutely baffling as an experienced writer. A poor conflict makes a bad story, but no conflict makes for no story, not a good one. Don't get confused.",5
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"Sometimes you feel like you might be Isekai'ed out but the reason there are so many of them is that if done right, they can be great. This show is done right.It has all the troups, and it plays them more or less straight. It's not a parody like Konosuba but manages to remind everyone why we loved this genre in the first place. It's a fun entertaining romp through a fantasy Isekai with a lovable cast of characters, great voice acting, and awesome animation.This anime is a reminder that execution is key. You don't always need to be a completely original never before seen edge of storytelling. If you can execute well you can have a great entertaining anime.",4.5
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"""That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime"" comes across as a typical OP main character fantasy anime at a glance and granted it is to a degree, but the way they handle the power of Rimuru is very alike that of Ainz in Overlord. His power isn't his defining characteristic but his interactions with the various other characters is. The show has a way of making you invested in the characters quite quickly which is why it is one of my favorite of the season. It is one of the reasons I look forward to Monday mornings and im always excited to see what happens next, whether the episode is action packed or slow it has a way of gluing your eyes to the screen and hyping up the following episode. Hopefully the show continues for a long time as I am excited to see where the story goes!",4.5
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"I rarely find myself completely invested in an anime, I fall behind and then just give up on too many shows.  But this one I was in love from episode 1 and binge-watched all that were available, only to be depressed when I caught up.  I fell in love with everything about this.  The wide variety of lovable, complex characters most of whom get some kind of back story and character evolution.  But the story doesn't stray too far away from the main protagonist, Rimura, who despite definitely being an over-powered characters stays likable and down-to-earth.  Well done.  I hope this anime continues on the same path that the first 10 episodes have (exciting, heart-warming and funny) and it will be one my my all-time favorites ever.",5

that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,so imma be real this show is straight gang weed until 2.74/4th of the way though because you realize that aint nothing happening to these god/anime powered supa guys. you also got some jailbait in there which i guess is a plus for some people. but you kinda realize no ones gonna die when they yeet that flying fish faster than the final boss of diablo III after i convinced that guy to give me his hacked gear. im not even playing i told him that blizzard knew he hacked and were waiting until he had a high level to ban him and i said i could fix it. worked on 3/5 people i tried it with but yeah back to the review. its got some absolutly hilarious scenes where ya man chad gabiru finna talk to the champ like mcgregor and gets destroyed like the final boss of diable three after i stole some guys hacked loot. 4/5 because no one died but that one person,3
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"After watching all but the Veldora Journal episode (yes I've read them and yes they're pretty hilarious) I can say this show is perfectly average and great if you want an easy watch to unwind after a long day. Beyond that... ehhhhhh...The premise of the show is great and the first episode really got me hooked. I thought the concept of a person from another world bumbling his way around the new one as a simple slime was fun and interesting and left a lot of room for growth. I was definitely right about it being fun, but that's about it, and that's why this show gets 3 stars. It's not bad or boring enough to be below average, but it's definitely not interesting or clever enough to be above average. And so here it is, as I said before, perfectly average. My biggest problem with the show is that it really doesn't do anything with the concept it starts with. There is SO much room for character growth and development at the beginning but there's the same amount of room at the end of the show. No one grows as a character, no one faces any real challenges (once they're part of MC's group), and there's just no real story arc to anything. As the show goes on, it feels more and more mechanical and predictable as the tropes seep in and originality seeps out. The production value of the show is excellent so it never really feels forced or cheaply done, but a lot of it just feels hollow. Everything is fluid and the comedy is usually pretty on point, which is why I think it's held so many viewers (including myself), but that's as deep as the show gets. There's no real conflict and all the early teases we get at ""villains"" almost never have any significance later on. Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideThe only one that's different is the Orc Lord, but once the build-up is done even that is wrapped up pretty quickly and easily. The best part of the show in my opinion is the production, and it's the only reason I kept up with it until the end of the main plot line. Otherwise I probably would've checked out some time after ep 14 or 15 when they don't even bother hiding the tropes anymore. I love the art, I love the voice acting, and I absolutely adore the design (mostly). I think I'm with the majority here who liked the OG ogres' design immensely better than the human forms. My favorite character though is probably Gabiru but I can say with confidence that it's all because of the voice acting. When I closed my eyes while he was talking I just put Kazuma in his place saying Kazuma things and laughed my butt off. (""Gabiru, Gabiru!"" ""Hai, Gabiru desu""). I had hoped, based on the first 2 or 3 eps, that this show might be able to handle an OP MC as well as, say, DBZ or One Punch Man, but unfortunately he never faces a real challenge and aside from the laughs the show becomes pretty dull because of it. Don't get me wrong, it's still well worth the watch compared to some of the absolute garbage out there, but don't get your hopes up thinking it's gonna blow your mind. As I said before, it's a great ""popcorn show"" where you can just turn off your brain and watch as adorable characters be cute and funny with each other and occasionally blow some sh*t up, but if you're looking for something quality to binge as this season draws to a close, you're better off checking out Mob Psycho 100 S2 if you haven't already.Cheers, hope this helped!",2
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"TLDR: The show decides somewhere along the line that any worthwhile factors that can drive a narrative forward and keep you invested at the same time arent needed and spends the first 10-13 episodes showing you potential and giving you hope for a great story, and the next 10-13 dragging your hopes through the mud.There will be minor spoilers that aren't marked with tags, I'll try my best to keep major ones in the boxes.I would like to start by saying that when I started watching this isekai, I loved it. It felt different, and refreshing. The way they introduced us to the world through Rimurus interactions with all the different monsters around the cave he popped out of was really cool. There was a sense of wonder: ""What kinds of monsters will he meet next? How strong is Rimuru compared to other races? How will these races interact with one another? What will happen when humans meet a talking slime? How serious will this show be? I had so many questions about how his life would change having been reborn as what is a boring monster in most fantasy RPGs. It had the appeal of the Rubber fruit from One Piece. Around the halfway mark this stopped being the case. There's no more wonder, it's just... meh....  To explain why I feel this way, let me tell you what I look for in an isekai.1. It needs to be interesting from the first two episodes.2. It needs to do world building, I want to know everything about how a world works, and why it works that way. It doesn't have to be straight away tho, some mystery is cool. 3. There has to be some fleshed out characters with some motivation in the narrative. 4. Substance, I want to feel like things that happen in the show matter. In the first 12 or so episodes all this is for the most part met. The first episodes are interesting, world building happens through Rimuru exploring the forest outside his cave, coming into contact with different monsters, and learning about the world through them as well. We get a couple characters with a personality and the plot moves forward. Then it starts backtracking, things that are happening seem to matter less and less, conflict isn't really conflict as much as it is a minor inconvenience, dire situations are only dire for races that have yet to meet our protagonist. Introductions speed up, characters stop getting fleshed out, any development you hoped for is long gone, cause there's a new story arc and it doesn't have time for the characters you started to care about. Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideIn the early episodes Rimuru and his new gang of goblins go to visit the dwarven kingdom in search of craftsmen. Some stuff happens and they get thrown out of the kingdom (with the best craftsmen they could ever get, boo-freakin-hoo), followed by the king basically exiling one of his ministers for ruining his chance to build a relationship with the powerful slime who made the only full potion they've ever seen. So that's a consequence, right? Right? Getting thrown out of dwarf land has to create some problems for them later, right? RIGHT? Nope.. About 10 episodes later they make up like nothing happened and the minister responsible for all the ""trouble"" even moves to Rimurus village to live there and do research.Once I realised every story arc is only there to introduce an ever expanding cast of characters and races, with very limited time if any for fleshing them out and making you care, and the only possible endings were, everyone is happy and everything is great, thank our mighty god Rimuru, all the issues this show has started creeping out from the shadows.There's no suspense, no character development (unless you count the atrocity that is annoying lizardman#1), no consequences and any character worth giving a damn about is either dead (or might as well be dead) or gets like 30 seconds of screentime every other episode. Granted these points mostly apply to the second half of the season, but still. It's there in the first ones as well, it just wasn't as noticeable.I got the answers to most of my questions, tho. Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideHe meets most troupe races in a gameworld fantasy setting. Goblins, Ogres, Orcs, Lizardmen, Humans, Dwarves, Druids, Fairies, and apparently some others that were cut from the anime. He is stronger than all of them combined, he only meets 3 characters that are actually stronger than he is, eats one like it didn't even matter, and befriends the other two. He befriends everyone he meets(literally, even the enemy that he ate). If a race doesn't get a long with another race, it's cause they havent met the nice slime yet. Talking monsters doesn't surprise a single human, everyone just goes with it. The show doesn't take anything seriously, and at the end I came to realise that Rimuru is barely a functioning character with a personality. Probably would've noticed sooner if they didn't introduce/reintroduce one or more characters every single f*****g episode. Even though the season isn't technically over, and there might be more I'm left dissappointed enough over a show I thought would be the best one of the season before christmas that I might not even finish it. It feels like the creator wanted this to be a long running shounen, changed his mind and made it an isekai, but kept all his characters because he still wanted to tell the same story even with less time to do it in.Oh well..P.S For the manga readers, I'm aware that the manga does a lot of this better, and producers probably screwed the last half of the season over by pushing the main plot forward. But this is still the end product, and it's dissappointing.",5
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"Let me just say right here this isn't a bad anime but, there is something more going on than pure entertainment. The protagonist is an overpowered Mary Sue, and while it was fun to watch for the first couple of episodes, I started to get this odd feeling that everything was going too well. The monsters fight and are forgiven, everyone is forgiven, everyone works together, everyone gets a name, everyone has a role, everyone contributes, everyone follows the overpowered Rimuru or is annihilated, and everyone has an undying love for their Savior or is cast out.  By the end of episode 14, I decided to not continue watching as it was incredibly on the nose with the messaging. I just literally can't. I watch anime to relax or to feel good about seeing people do the right thing, not to literally watch Jesus Christ in anime form.",5
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"An isekai that separates itself from the lackluster crap that's been put out this year! You won't regret watching this show...Thank god it's going to go for 24 episodes!The protagonist is smart and decent. And as a slime, he actually has more of a personality than the cardboard cutouts of his isekai colleagues. The world-building is exceptional! This is one of the few shows that give life and character to the NPC monsters. Contrast the cute and sexy goblins here to Goblin Slayer, for instance lol! I like that even though the protagonist has OP skills, he often has to learn it for himself. The fact that he's just a slime ball adds a unique element into the anime. He also has purpose in what he does, whether it's helping goblins rebuilding, or stopping bad guys, he actually has a reason for why he's doing it. Not just...because? I'm personally tired of isekai animes with boring OPs with OP  skills who wander aimlessly. Give them a purpose! This show has definitely delivered.",5
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"FAVOURITE FALL 2018 ANIME OR MAYBE FAVOURITE ANIME OF ALL TIME!Honestly I've probably seen all the episodes out so far whilst waiting for new content! This show possesses amazing animation, great character development, fantastic fight scenes and the perfect amount of comedy!One of my favourite animes is Overlord, well it was my favourite, until this came out! I've always loved animes where the main character begins powerful and this anime portrays it perfectly. It took me such a long time to find an anime similar where the main character actually had personality!It was so tempting not to read the manga as I did not want to spoil the rest of the season, however I couldn't help myself, this story is just too good.The only complaint I have about this anime is that I wish the episodes would come out sooner!!!",5
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"This show is definitely charming and a very fun take on the isekai genre. While it does follow many old tropes MCs usually have it does them differently. Instead of being a bland overpowered character with no ambition this show presents us with a character that takes on the role of a master of his craft which is not usually seen in many shows. Most shows have the mc under  a master. It is entertaining as he knows he is powerful and he understands his own rank and acts accordingly. Only negatives I have are the fight scenes have little to no stakes in the overall story and the show is very predictable with little characterization for most of the cast. It still bugs me that most monsters lose their monster traits and evolve into a human looking monsters. I wish they kept the monster design instead of becoming generic designs. (there are a lot, and i mean a lot, of characters by the way, i actually stopped trying to memorize most of their names) The art style is also is a bit generic with slight differences and the animation can be a bit lack luster with big explosive moves taking center stage.Nonetheless, It is a charming show, lighthearted, comedic and it isn't completely brain-dead and actually develops a very likable cast. Not the most intensive plot or characters, but it is a decent enough show among the pile of isekai trash. 3/5",5
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"If you like open world survival RPG's with an element of base building then you're gonna like That Time I got Reincarnated as a Slime. It adds nation building to the traditional Isekai formula in a way that gets gamers interested. Story 3/5: A 37 year old programmer gets stabbed and dies when he is reborn in an Isekai fantasy world as a slime with this OP ability to eat and gain powers from other monsters. He then starts to expand his influence over the area and creates a nation-state of monsters. It doesn't do anything particularly unique but it does the traditional Isekai tropes well. Where it falters is in the nation building aspect. The part about the Slime Isekai that I felt unrealistic and weak was in the adversaries and situations he had to deal with. People forgive way too easily in this anime and diplomacy and peace are practically given to him rather than earned through strategy, dialogue and negotiation. Characters 2/5: The characters are somewhat one-dimensional. There aren't really any hidden motivations or character complexity. Everyone follows their tropes really well. The main issue with this anime is that there isn't any challenge for the characters to overcome which means that character development is weak and given instead of earned. Any character who comes in contact with the main protagonist instantly becomes extremely strong without having to do anything. Moreover, everyone forgives too easily. You have entire villages mowed to the ground, hundreds of thousands of soldiers annihilated, then the next scene everyone's buddy buddy.Art/Animation 5/5: The anime is animated beautifully, The magic abilities are absolutely beautiful. The fights are dynamic and fast paced. Each swing of the sword or magic cast has a good amount of weight to it such that it feels epic whenever anyone gets a good shot off or casts a powerful spell. Also big fan of the character designs, particularly of Shion, Shuna, and Milim. ;)Sound 4/5: Good sounds, battles sound intense. The fight music fits pretty well and helps get you into the fight. Opening and Ending songs are pretty standard, not amazing. Enjoyment 4/5: This isn't a particularly deep anime but it is quite enjoyable especially if you like open world survival RPG's. It actually does fan service in a really good way. There is quite a lot of fan service but it doesn't feel gratuitous. Overall 3/5: It had a lot of potential that it could have achieved had it been more daring with its plot. It seems to take the easy way out of resolving any conflicts which inhibits its ability to really shine. It's like when you play Skyrim and you do that alchemy/enchanting trick to make OP weapons and you just one shot everything. Yeah, it's fun but it doesn't feel like you've earned anything.",4.5
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"Which is no small wonder. The ones I have bothered to watch in the past, for the most part, strike me as pathetic. But this one is different, and that's because the protagonist here isn't your typical cardboard cutout hack-n-slash maniac that you find in just about all the others. Nope, this guy, instead of becoming some kind of supernatural sword or sorcerer hero when he gets plopped in the middle of his fantasy cosmos, becomes the lowest being of the low - a slime. But instead of bemoaning the fact, he embraces it. He learns he has a penchant for engulfing other beings, and being able to assimilate their abilities. Before you know it, he's engulfed a freaking dragon. And although he's well on his way to becoming a total [email protected] @ss, he remains humble. Instead of lording over the others he meets in his new world, he finds ways to bring outcasts together. He forms an entire nation where they work hard to create a safe and secure world, where all have value to the community. This is actually fraught with peril, as it throws some serious monkey wrenches into the established order. Our hero has to find solutions to conflict, time and again. That doesn't mean he always uses force or violence to do so. He's basically a cream puff at heart. But when those he cares about are threatened, he will take the action needed. If that sounds like great writing, it is. An engaging narrative where the characters get a chance to live, make mistakes, correct them, and move on once they've grown a little bit. The artwork is a little pedestrian, there is no ground breaking in that regard, but everything is rendered in a quality, professional way. I liked the background work. The animation is better than most in this genre. A few iffy sequences in the middle episodes, where it was obvious they were trying to pinch pennies, but nothing that was too grievous. The Japanese voice acting was well done and heartfelt. I got the feeling the cast sensed it was doing something exceptional, and they really put their hearts into it. I never thought I'd ever say this about any isekai, but I would really like to see the producers come out with more seasons of this title. There is so much more I can see them doing with Rimuru, and his world, that would be engaging. I will be more than a little disappointed if they don't give us some more slime. Hopefully very soon!",4.5
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"This show is the incarnation of wholesome. Something about it just makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside. The studio seems to put a lot of love and care into it. The animation is beautiful, and the sound effects are unique and distinctly pleasant. The plot is interesting and refreshing. My only negatives would be a little bit too much fan service with Shion’s breasts and the pacing seems too rushed. It feels like important content is being skipped from time to time. I am excited to see where this series goes for season 2.",5
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"That Time I Got Reincarnated As A Slime (which I'm going to abbreviate to just Slime) is an anime full of great ideas that kept me watching. Unfortunately, ideas is all it has; if you're expecting a new, fresh take on the Isekai genre, this isn't it.At least in the beginning, Slime does distinguish itself from other Isekai anime. Instead of the protagonist waking up in their new fantasy world as a plucky, level 1 adventurer, protagonist Rimuru Tempest wakes up as a lowly blue slime. After meeting up with the Storm Dragon Veldora, who's imprisoned in the cave Rimuru awakens in, our slimy protagonist makes a pact with Veldora to free him. After consuming the dragon like he's Kirby, prison and all, Rimuru ends up stumbling into leading a village of goblins, first protecting them from a pack of direwolves. It's at this early point in the show where one of the many great, intriguing ideas of Slime shows its face. To make things easier on himself, Rimuru gives all the goblins names. Unbeknownst to him, however, giving a name to a nameless monster in this world causes them to evolve, and the entire village of stumpy, weak goblins grows into much stronger hobgoblins overnight. The concept of ""names=power"" is one of the most fascinating ideas in Slime, but unfortunately, the show never even tries to go into more depth with it. If naming a monster gives them more power, are nameless monsters treated like second-class citizens? When monsters receive names, they usually become more human-like, so does that mean humans are some sort of ideal being in this world? Does a newborn baby not qualify as a human until it gets a name? If I name my dog, is it going to turn into a bishounen furry and start talking to me?None of these questions, or even anything like them, are dealt with in Slime. The show treats its naming mechanic as just a way to turn monstrous characters into more palatable, attractive humanoids (If you think the goblins' evolutions were bad, wait until you meet the ogres).I could overlook the missed potential... if the anime itself was anything interesting at all. Throughout all 24 episodes, practically no obstacle that ever presents itself to Rimuru poses any sort of challenge to him. The many enemies that he faces never pose an actual threat, so there's never any tension to the show. Adding to that, the presentation is nothing to write home about either; the animation is serviceable but not especially eye-catching, the music is forgettable, and the less said about the character designs the better.All in all, there's not much of a reason to reccomend Slime. While it shows promise early on, it eventually proves itself to be just another cookie-cutter Isekai anime. If you want to be frustrated at the countless times it ignores potentially unique and groundbreaking plotlines, that's pretty much all there is to see here.",3

that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"SLIME: 10.0/10.0 DC points (Dylan's crunch points)What a brilliant anime! The story line is very easy to follow, but it's not always predictable... which keeps it exciting. The super powers and character development are spectacular. Consistent fight scenes, mixed with on-going story development & new characters keeps each episode action packed and fun to watch. Highly recommend for people just getting into anime and anime lovers alike. Enjoy",4
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"The first 12 episodes do a lot of subtle things that make this series so enjoyable to watch.  The animation is silky smooth.  It has cute girls (and boys if that's your jam), but doesn't focus on that.  The pacing is perfection!  It just feels so relaxed, even though there's a lot going on, something important is always happening.  It doesn't rely on monologing or flashbacks of previously iterated content, it just expects that you are able keep up (weird, right?).  I love the world building.  Also the OP and ED.  It's a fun show about being nice to monsters.The next part abandons all that, and mostly mines for content and hot springs scenes.  Plus two recap episodes.  Ugh.If this series moves on, I'm not sure what to expect.",5
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"I honestly don't see what people see in this show. The world is generic for an Isekai show, and it's something you would see in shows like Konosuba, Re:Zero etc.My biggest annoyance with this show is the MC. He is just SO unappealing and boring. Everything gets handed to him easily. Need to defeat a huge golem? ONE PUNCH! Need to defeat an orc lord? ONE PUNCH! Ohhh a demon loli went to your nation, wants to fight you but she is overpowered and stronger than you? GIVE HER SOME HONEY AND BECOME HER BEST FRIEND, WHY WOULD YOU LOSE?? Whenever they introduce a ""powerful"" villain he just gets his ass kicked, because there is NO tension when you know that the MC will win no matter what.Characters (especially female ones) are uselessly introduced just to be forgotten the next episode, or if they're not thrown into the dark depths of boring story following/progression, are made to be boob flesh for blob boy to use when he's bored.It's infuriating how boring it is to follow this character's story. Mob Psycho 100 handles OP characters beautifully, something this show will never achieve. As i have said, everything gets handed to him on silver platter. Everyone worships him as he's the ""great tempest "" aka Jesus Christ in anime form. No plot ✓ No tension ✓ No real threat ✓ Useless characters ✓ Unappealing MC ✓ Yup, everything checks out .Overall a really bad show that people for some reason love, i honestly don't know why i watched all 24 episodes.I'm giving it two stars just because of the somewhat decent animation, otherwise it's a straight up one star.MANGA SPOILER!!

Protagonist, from the very first episode is someone you immediately get a connection with, even down to a tried but true last request to his Kohai.The anime is full of wonder turns of phrases based around who the protag...   ok his Name Is Rimmuru, yeah that is a capital name, names are in some cases capital in this series, which is a rare path to explore that few anime try to incorporate... I am intentionally being vague as honestly a lot of this stuff is part and parcel to the anime really drawing you in.. It's quirks to the world being, side from slimes and faeries and demons, oh my, that make it so enjoyable to watch.Rimuru is a fantastic main character, identifiable, free from most tropes such as harems, even though the series does include many attractive harem candidates, they are simply not dumbed down to being 'harem girl: tsundere"".Characters have ranges of emotions, from arrogant to semic comic relief, and it flows without issue, much like it would in real life.  Nothing takes itself too seriously about the series, Rimmuru even takes pot shots at himself, and despite serious portions of the storyline existing, it never leaves the realm of ""this may be serious, but life is like that sometimes"".  As cliche as it is, you will laugh till you can't breathe and have to pause the show, or you will cry and almost feel gutted, the premise however remains the same, working through life, overcoming it, and occasionally eating dragons.My review is convoluted, and odd, but I honestly love this show, I have watched the entire series twice, and still bounce back to earlier episodes if I think I missed something.  I can't ask for more from a show than to have an engrossing storyline, enjoyable or detestable characters, a sense of humor about it-self, enjoyable art, fantastic world setting and an ever more involved storyline.  Watch this show if you have a reasonably good sense of humor, like fantasy settings and enjoy a show for what it is.  Don't watch it if you are ever so srs, have a political or whatever agenda, or can't tell filler from origin stories.",3
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,As i continue to watch watch this anime as much as i enjoy it i am slightly disappointed by how much content they cut from the manga so much so that some key parts are completely different. Some scenes are completely skipped and replace with a brief summary. so you end up losing any funny thing that happened or even stuff that could have been put into another whole episode. I am not trying to be some Manga know it all but after watching a lot of Anime that runs almost exactly like the manga it gets hard for me to enjoy the anime content when i know there is a lot more story or getting disappointed when you are waiting to see a scene from the manga play out in action only for it to be skipped or for something that was kept short and sweet in the manga to be stretched out and become boring. All in all this is a good anime the Characters are cool and the action sequences are engaging but after seeing so many differences i'm no longer eager to see what happens in the next episode.,5
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"They've done great with the anime, capturing the feel and vib of the world Rimuru is in, but I have some problems with the translation from Source material to the Anime. Originally this was a Lite Novel, then a Manga, to an Anime, i've read the first volume of the LT and most of the manga I could find, and I have noticed huge skips in the story telling, Such as the making of the Story to cover up who actually defeated the Orc Lord, the travel to the Kingdom to see the kids, Charybdis arc was a complete mess and Missing minor details. This isnt FMA to FMA:B but the minor details made the world much more lived in and believable, and you can notice most of the Skipped details and story in the form of From this scene To that scene , like from defeating Charybdis to extracting it from the dude, there was a whole dialog and discussion about it, and traveling to the human kingdom wouldve taken Rimurur thru andother kingdom to the adventurers guild of that kingdom and then to the academy to the children, not just a straight shoot to the kids, there was emphasis on the Full Heal potion that is completely missing from the entire story . I love the anime, the art style is wonderful, and they are hitting the main points of it, but the minor points and i wouldnt say side stories but sub stories that added to the world and gave context to events are missing and make things feel ""Off"" in the flow of the story. If you like the Isekai genre, you'll love this show, at the least, you'll enjoy it,If you know the source material, you'll feel a bit disappointed with how they ""fast lane"" the main story, whether it be for episode constraints or whatever it's how it is3.7/5 Stars",3
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,This anime is so good. The animation is true to the manga sometimes even better than the original source material. The soundtrack of this anime is one of the best ones that I have heard in a while. The fight scenes are very epic with great visuals. Every character in this anime is distinctive and the story is this anime is complex yet straightforward with no repetition. Every week I wait in anticipation for the next episode as I await what happens next in this amazing story. I highly recommend this anime to everybody! Ps milim is best girl.,5
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"I think this show has a similar feel to it as Overlord. The main character is thrown into a new world and given immense power. You get to watch as they discover just how powerful they are. I liked Overlord's first season but then it kind of fell off for me. I wonder how this one will do. I am 6 episodes in right now. I was worried it was just another harem anime and maybe it is later on based on the art and the main character's goals sexually. But so far I'm enjoying myself so I guess that's all you need. Animation is nice, characters are entertaining. Got some back story on the love interest. I wonder where it's all leading and if it will end as a cliffhanger like Konosuba, leave it to our imaginations on the party continuing their adventures.",4.5
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"This anime caught my eye while I was looking for a new show to devote my soul to. THIS WAS IT! My new favorite! I wish there were more episodes, but regardless, this is one I'll never forget! The characters are so lovable and the plot flows pretty smoothly. I couldn't put my IPad down and spent the entire day watching! It's really addicting and leaves the viewer with a hunger for the next episode. Honestly, the only complaint I have is that the art style isn't my favorite. Other than that, this is ultimately my all time favorite anime after watching Kill La Kill, Fairy Tail, Assassination classroom, Ancient Magus Bride, Sailor Moon, The Devil is a Part-timer, One Punch Man, Mob Phsyco100, Sword Art Online, and a ton more! All of those animes were fantastic, but this one really took a firm hold on my heart! This is one ill never let go!",4.5
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"As of now, this is easily my favorite show of this season. Its sad that its only gonna be 25 episodes. Having not read the manga and not really being a manga reader since im in high school and have priorities, I enjoy sitting down to eat or laying in bed watching anime that i actually like. When i first started watching this show, it was about 11 o clock on a school night in which i wake up at 7 in the morning... being who i am, i got carried away and stayed awake until almost 3 watching the first 12 episodes. I was so obsessed with this anime that i watched the next episode while waiting for the shower to warm up and after i got to school with the few minutes of time i had before my first class. I havent watched a lot of Isekai anime. I come from growing up with dragon ball and a little bit of Full metal alchemist, and only recently got into other animes. Despite this, this anime makes me really happy that ive been able to branch off and enjoy new anime. I get attached to characters i like really easily, and this anime is FULL of lovable characters. Being 16 episodes in, i really wish i would have started watching it back in july when it was fresh. Having to catch up makes me feel like i missed out on some of the suspense, or lack their of, with this anime. Overall, im very glad that ive been watching Slime and when its all said and done will probably rewatch it multiples time when im waiting weeks in between other shows. PLEASE watch this, you will LOVE it!!!",5
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"I originally picked this anime up because the thought of a slime as the main character just seemed refreshing and comedic to the now over-saturated market of ""other dimension adventure anime,"" and it turned out to be one of my favorites! I love the pacing of the story and the wholesomeness of it; it's nice to watch an anime where I don't have to be on the edge all the time, and there's no cliche super-evil-villain-waiting-to-destroy-the-world type story. But even with the overall lighter tone compared to other anime, this show still manages to include action and some tear-jerker moments so it stays interesting.I highly recommend this show for anyone and everyone!",5
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"As I have seen the popular isekai anime, I can say this is only the second one that has stood out to me. The one other was Overlord. The reason being was the reversal of the usual. The protagonist is OP and there's always a struggle in every fight, but it's predictable that the protagonist is capable of defeating the antagonist. But Overlord is in the eyes of an obvious antagonist. Which made it memorable and putting it in its own category. TIGRAS is also in its own category. It's actually good! No plot holes, great character development, and entertaining. The thoughts that go through Rimuru's mind are (somewhat) logical for someone that was reincarnated. Yes he's OP, but he doesn't question his own strength. Making his and the development of side characters outstanding! I very much recommend. Easy 5 stars from me.",5
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"This anime I think is very special, good character design, a main character who doesn't always jump the gun whenever someone so much as udders wolf, and a serious and also playful  and loving sort of atmosphere. It reminds me heavily of sitting down playing 'Dragon Quest IX Sentinels of The Starry Sky' with friends. The stories of that game was gripping and all ties in with the main over arching story. I feel this series has that and many other similar, but very good and complimentary themes. If you are looking to laugh, cry a bit at times, and smile for a while; after it all, this series is right up your alley!",3
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"I started to watch this out of boredom and with no expectations but after that I became pleasantly surprised how good the anime was. I fell in love with characters immediately and the story was just as good. I ended reading the manga and the web novel I will probably buy the light novel as well. This series has Made its place on my 'the best series of all time"" list and I am so glad I chose to watch it even when I thought it would be something I would not like. Everyone who is wondering if they should watch ""that time I got reincarnated as a slime"" , I say ""please do"". It's definitely worth it!",3
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"Excuse my lack of how simulcasts work & I may be a newb to the releasing of episodes, but what happened to episode 14 for 12/31/18. I guess there is a break between the normal/final episodes??? Will there be an episode 14, since I have seen other anime's just stop after only 1 or 3 that aren't movies or one off's.Can someone post when the next one will be released since I cant seem to find it on any of the default Crunchyroll posted schedules?.I noticed something different about this one, the characters surrounding the main seem to have greater depth and character development instead of all the power/glory going to the main.  Extremely refreshing.Overall a great series & fun to watch over and over, especially with friends who have never seen it. Just the reactions alone of bewilderment and laughter are worth every minute spent.  I do enjoy this one just as much as I did GATE, looking forward to every new episode, having actual discussions about what was good or bad and knowing each new episode is possibly just as good as the last.",4
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"This show truly left me on the edge of my seat. Each episode is as compelling as the last and I for one cannot wait for more content to be released! This anime is humorous and detailed with many moments that made me feel as if I was within an outstanding novel, with each episode being the next chapter. Whilst one would usually loathe the completion of a good book, I can't wait until I can lay witness to the climax of this anime's story... It's not as if this anime is perfect but its imperfections can be overlooked for the sake of a wholesome experience.",5
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"It's an isekai with some nuances. One being  Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hidehe gets reincarnated as a slime Okay big spoiler, but seriously I wasn't sure what to expect. You'd think a slime is some weak monster but with his skills he becomes much more.His skills are kind of OP but he's not necessarily the strongest monster right away. The MC is the right balance for an MC. He's not a push over and he's not an insufferable NEET that rejects his harem. In fact, it's cool seeing the slime conquer and grow. I can't really put my finger on why this is so good but it's pretty captivating even after the first few episodes.The side characters are pretty funny as well and they too grow along in the anime.",5
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"I think we all have to agree that the ""into a new world"" isekai concept is overdone. I went into this anime thinking it'll be like every other anime of this genre. Boyyyy was I wronggg. The one major difference, the main character is damn cute slime. A SLIME! Not only that but this SLIME is OP. The story is fluid, the characters are fun, the animation is *muah muah*. I think you know what to do. Watch, duhhh.",4
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"I absolutely love this show in every way possible.The animation style is cheery and bright, the music is fitting, the balance of comedy and tragedy is amazing and honestly unexpected, the story and character development is believable (with some obvious reservations), and the overall mood of this show is inviting and feel-good anime.I'm not going into any details on the story because you should be watching it right now anyways.Stop Reading Reviews And Go Watch The Whole Thing.five outta five",2
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"The show is such a masterpiece, with its outstanding comedy, action, and weirdness, it creates this void of never-ending entertainment that many people would enjoy. Surely the plot is a bit off, but once you start getting into the show, everything starts making sense. Not only do I recommend this anime for its comedy, but also it's emotional and action side pays a great tribute to this as well. May this show run for a long time.",4.5
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"I saw this anime pop up several times and I didn't even click to see what it was about because I assumed it was one of those that were a waste of time even watching the intro or reading the reviews.  After the number of anime in my queues went down after the season ended for a bunch, I was browsing through at random and accidentally clicked on this one, and saw that it had really high reviews.  So instead of reading the description or anything I just dove into it since I had time to kill.  5 minutes into it, I was stuck.  Went through all the episodes out right now and can't wait for the next one.  Although the title is pretty stupid sounding, it actually makes sense after watching ep1.  The story is pretty good and it has a good combo of bad ass, hilarious, and the feels... This is one that I can probably go back and watch again over and over.  It's a plus if you understand Japanese.",4.5
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"BOY was I wrong. Good lord, don't take this show for face value. It's a witty comedy that takes the classic isekai we've all grown to love/hate and rewrites the formula in the most refreshing, yet hilariously outrageous way. The show is incredibly well-paced, and while maintaining a lighthearted air, the director also knows when to tone down the jokes in its more serious moments. To my surprise, he even manages to use the nature of the isekai genre to his advantage in making one of the most tear-jerkingly beautiful scenes I've seen in recent anime, especially this early on into a series. It skyrocketed my hopes up for the rest of its run, and I doubt it'll disappoint!",5
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,I have to say I would probably not have even looked at this anime had a friend not recommended it to me. I thought it would be just another tale of an incredibly OP main character just laying waste to everything he touches. What happened after watching the first episode however was that I was immediately hooked.  I binge read the manga as soon as I finished watching the first few episodes of the series and am happily surprised with how close the anime adaptation is to the original series. I even picked up the light novel and am currently making my way through that. The anime however hooks you and you will be in pain every week waiting for the next episode. The animation quality is superb and the characters and plot are both gripping. Overall I'd say this is my favorite anime this season and one of my favorites ever. I'm really looking forward to seeing what future seasons have in store!,5
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"This is by far one of my most favorite animes despite its very early beginnings. The anime flawlessly connects comedy with hardcore action and I can see some very good character progression to come in the future episodes. With how episode 7 ended, it's a tell tale sign that they are looking to push this anime into an incredible depth. Sure, the slime seems incredibly OP right now, but I can foresee some formidable opponents in the near future. If they keep this up, I could see this being at least 100 episodes worth of an anime. If they manage a super awesome plot twist down the line, easily 200+.",5
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"I haven't actually ever written a review on this site and its especially odd to pick a show with just six episodes so far for review, but I just wanted to say that this series has been amazing so far, the animation style is great and the plot is really coming together nicely.  I won't spoil anything for others who haven't watched the show, but I am really excited about this series and have great expectations of future episodes, I think in fact I found my new favorite series in quite a long time.",3
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"This show really caught my attention very easily from the very first episode. I had seen a clip of when the slime (Rimuru) is exploring the cave and acquiring new skills, and that immediately got me hooked.The show doesn't take itself seriously, and it has a lot of the typical fantasy RPG tropes in it such as leveling up, and gaining new skills. But for some reason this one feels fresh. For starters, the protagonist is not a dumb teenager, but a salaryman who's in his early 30s, and gets sent to another world as an overpowered Slime after being killed. Neither going to that other world, nor how he would be in that other world, were his choice, but he doesn't begrudge it either.Instead, the protagonist rejoices in this new opportunity, and explores everything to the best of his ability. He's not a selfish being, and has the best intention towards all around him, especially those who have a harder life (e.g. the goblins, oppressed dwarves). His mission is to make a very peaceful world, and so far he's been quite successful.There isn't much strife in the first five episodes, but I have a nagging suspicion that sooner or later that's going to change. I just hope that when it does happen, things won't be dark and depressing. Oh, and even with the tropes and all, it's definitely not as stale as others in the same genre of being transported to a fantasy world. And it's also not perverted like the other ones, which is a huge plus in my opinion.TL;DR great pacing, light-hearted fun, has some tropes, but it's not stale",3
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"I was wary about a story with a simple slime being the main character but as of yet this anime has defied my expectations. The main protagonist is well thought out, while seeming overpowered and able to execute his new found abilities at whim he does not do so and instead thinks more so about the repercussions of said actions. Most of the characters within each episode are fleshed out and able to be understood as well, making this an excellent anime to be taken in by it's world creation. I hope this anime has a bright future.",2
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"While watching the show for the past couple of weeks EPs 1-4, I generally enjoyed it even with it's simplistic story and minor conflicts. Before episode 5 I would have said it was easy 4/5 isekai, not so high as to say a few years from now I would re-watch it.After episode 5, I can 100% guarantee that this has become one of my top favorite anime and I absolutely will be re-watching it in the future. The reason why is for the court scene in specific. Any anime could have gotten away with just allowing Vesta to be the bad guy and let him get away with what he did, but showing that the king did not buy even a moment of his shit and showing that Vesta may have been a dick but genuinely loved his king and was distraught when he was let go, shows that this anime understands that even the people on the other side of the story exist as people. When he began to cry and sink to his knees, the animation and sounds involved with that portrayed a level of fear and sadness that only someone who really cares about his position and king could show.10/10 would become a slime again.",5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"I don't write these. this is my first, this show is a gift from the anime gods. it is perfection. not an opinion. a fact.8 episodes in and they are all flawless.  except the fact i want more of them. The Plot effortlessly moves between powerful, creepy, hilarious, and emotional. You love the characters. You are invested. Animation is honestly so gorgeous it ruins other animes for me a bit. Stop looking at reviews and hit play, you're welcome",5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"START WATCHING THIS NOW, EPISODE 19 IS A DAMN HOLIDAY.IT WILL GO DOWN IN HISTORY... I SAID ""OH Sh*@!"" like 3 timesJust the entire package of how they weave the music into the fight scenes, their color schemes, and the character designs just make this an untouchable series. This is one of the most SOLID shows I've stuck by to watch. And is definitely in my top 3 favorites, and it hasn't even ended the season. I have no words for this one.. LETS KEEP IT ALIVE",5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"Edit after ep.8: This is the new measuring stick. The show rose the bar on animation quality, music, story, and direction. This is how you make anime! It puts the 5 star anime from the last few years to shame! See bellow for details. Edit after ep.4:The anime get's even better. If they leave us with only the 4 episodes, this is still better than most anime ever. I'm not one to exaggerate, or heap praise, the classic water homage, the vocals, music, setting, everything is on point. Not to forget first boss battle done right in a long time. No useless power up sequences, everything was fast pace like a sword fight ought to be! Very satisfying, maybe close to original Berserk demon fights, but better animation and even less wasted efforts.Initial impressions: If you're tired of Marry and Mark Sue characters who ""awaken"" and just have a super power, and are unstoppable, watch this show. Oh boy, our protagonist's road to power is highly realistic even if most of it is folklore and mysticism. At the end of the training, he would be a force akin to a demon to the layman's eye. In one of the episodes he trains so much, he wears off the skin of his palms off. Been there, done that before a race. It happens, and it doesn't really hurt more than average durring training, but the morning after, oof, that burns! Our poor orphaned hero has just one reason to train this hard, his pure brotherly love for his sister.The chestnut haired hero returns home to find all his brothers and sisters killed, his mother eaten half through, the shocking image sends him reeling, and he trips over his half dead sister. Throws her on his back and runs towards the town. On the way it's found out that she is a demon, so he is sent to a demon slayer trainer, as he vows to turn her back. Simple story, told in a magnificent way. The animation is well detailed, so far the cover art shown is the same, maybe even lesser quality than the actual anime. The story is not pedantic, but it isn't simplified either. Things that must be said aren't glossed over, but aren't repeated ad nauseum either. The pace is nice, and the humor is a welcome surprise. If you are just starting, I recommend watching episode 1, 2, and 3 together since there is a bit to unpack. But, if you can't, watch 1 and 2 at the very least, since episode one is way more sorrowful, than the anime mood in general is intended to be. Watching episode one alone is a lot like eating the mustard without the hotdog, yes some love it, but it's too much for most people.",5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"While there are a few cliches in the opening episode, some of that is natural when it's such a popular genre. It's well written.The animation feels well blended with some CG elements, and overall feels smooth. The artwork, while not overly complex, is also solid and has a good feel. The details are in the right places. While the premise isn't really new, they still manage to make it quite interesting. My only complaint is the way they occasionally talk down to the audience with excessive monologues. Yes, I saw what happened, I don't need the characters to explain what I just saw by talking out loud. Still, this anime is very good so far, and I look forward to each episode. Just when you think you have the world figured out, it branches out just a bit more...",5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"Kimetsu no Yaiba came out 3 years ago in weekly shonen jump along with The Promised Neverland, and Dr.Stone. But unlike those series, Kimetsu is underated (in the west).It's definitely going to gain more recognition with the anime and be counted amongst the greats (DB, YYH, OP, HxH, Naruto, etc) as people get further into the series.Just 1 chapter in & it became one of my favs. Now it has a superb anime adapation. ^__^",5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"As much as I love the anime as a whole, I mostly came here to rave about its unique and incredibly visually-stunning art style. Many anime of the current age is full of shoddy 3D animation that has taken over the market. So this is a refreshing piece which I welcome with open arms. With its unique character designs, fluid action sequences, and gorgeous landscapes, weaving a tapestry of eye-gasmic beauty!While Demon Slayer is full of well executed plot points, so far at 7 episodes there has been a disappointing level of character development. Thus far, Tanjirou's (the protagonist) only known traits is his determination, his protective nature of his younger sister, and his good natured spirit. These character qualities can be seen in any number of action-oriented shows, and given the unfortunate circumstance of Nezuko Kamado (Tanjirou’s sister), her character will probably be relegated to an ‘unforeseen’ plot twist to stymie Tanjirou in his quest. A quest that feels somewhat predictable given Tanjirou’s motivations; however, an exciting one, nonetheless.All in all, this is a beautiful anime with an intense amount of action. And I don't mean intense as in nonstop, but given the rather dark side of the underlying plot, it is rather in a fashion where you can feel a tension accumulate and surge up as Tanjirou moves from one challenge to the next. But I love that this series gives an appropriate amount of time spent on each of those challenges; it neither needlessly draws any sequence out with unnecessary ""white noise"", nor does it cut anything short, but rather has a good flow of the story line as a whole. I recommend everyone give this one a try! And did I say it is gorgeously animated yet?",5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"One of the best Shonen adaptions of our time and by far the best show to air in 2019.The heart and soul of amazingly talented staffs at Studio Ufotable translated into this emotionally charged and visually stunning series, creating a roller coaster ride filled with breathtaking moments. The Ukiyo-e style splash action sequence and seamless 3D incorporation further enhance the intensity of critical decisions in this Dark Fantasy, taking viewer immersion to a whole new level. Excellent overall execution and cinema level quality production down to every last detail. This is a Must Watch.Rating: 5/5 - A masterpiece. I would recommend this to everyone who loves anime.",5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"Starting from a couple years back I would have never thought this story to be adapted into a full animated series, but learning of it's adaptation by Ufotable was a dream come true. For those who are just curious, I have found (after rereading from the beginning for a third time while new chapters/episodes come out...) that the anime so far - in the time I am typing this up - has more than perfectly followed the manga with certain scenes matching up perfectly with panels from the manga . Actually, instead of removing or changing parts, they've ADDED minor bits and details showing how much effort is going into this story. Therefore I encourage those who are starting from the animated series to wait patiently for new episodes rather than moving to the manga because I personally believe it will be a much more gratifying experience! I greatly appreciate Ufotable for taking this story into their hands and am genuinely excited to see the interpretations of character's voices and fight scenes by their staff. So far, the voice acting choices in my personal opinion have been close to spot-on. Let's go Kaneki!",5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"TL;DR: He protec, he attac, but most importantly he use his air sac. 3 Episode Test: PassedBrought to life by studio Ufotable of the Fate series together with Director Haruo Sotozaki & Producer Hikaru Kondo of the Tales of Zestiria, this anime has the potential to become a new age classic. Breathing new life into the Spring & Summer 2019 line up, this anime has proved to be a cut above any competition.The animation:The art style of mangaka Koyoharu Gotōge has been lifted from the page and given a life of its own. As an Action/Shounen style story, Demon Slayer delivers on its fight choreography and stunning fight scenes. Something remarkable to note about these scenes in particular is Ufotable's delicate use of CGI animation to enhance its 2D fight sequences.  Instead of detracting from the 2D art style, the animators chose to bring the character's attacks to life with CGI animation. No where is this more prevalent than the main protagonist's slashes and stances using a style referred to as Water Breathing; depicting traditional Japanese art sytled water forming along the protagonists sword and flowing along his slashes in a way that 2D animation alone could not express. Other uses of CGI like backgrounds or environments are so subtle or well done that they blend seamlessly.  It is the marriage of these two animations and the soft skillful hand of the CGI team that really make the action scenes in this series pop.The characters:Portrayed with easily identifiable colors and outfits, the primary, secondary and even a few background characters manage to feel distinct in this world; each with their own personalities, motivations and story to tell. Even a few episodes in the viewer will easily be able to identify which characters are which; an important feat for a series with an ever increasing roster.Buckle up however as the horror elements of this story come at you fast; as the story sends the unprepared viewer on an all expenses paid feels trip within the first few episodes. While not the primary attribute of this series, at no point in time does the viewer feel like the characters are free from harm; as physical, emotional and psychological trauma is routinely inflicted upon the main cast of characters. Battles feel like they have a real weight to them; as the characters are forced to spend time in the story healing as a result of their injuries or carry their injuries from previous battles into future encounters.The main protagonist Tanjirou Kamado was taken from the Shounen industry mold of young high spirited boys with bright colored haired and a knack for shouting; but given a major upgrade to his character.  Kind and compassionate even against his opponents despite both his and their dark past, Tanjirou is a compelling and talented but flawed underdog that the viewer can't help but cheer for or visualize themselves as. While the animation may picture him and other hunters as powerful elemental wielding heroes, in the end all these young hunters have are their blades, training and wit against the superior might, regenerative and even supernatural abilities of demons.  Take away the flashy stylistic metaphors of their attacks and these are young adults with swords facing down nigh-immortal creatures in a world where death is all but certain.Worldbuilding: The story of Demon Slayer feels very well thought out and lived in; where if the viewer would to be transported to that world, they could easily imagine themselves interacting with the characters or going off on their own mission to save villages and slay evil demons.At the center of this world is the Demon Hunter Corps (DHC), a membership of highly trained fighters who work to protect humanity from the scourge of demons.  We learn early on about its membership's ranks, how initiates are groomed for membership and tested, how society views members of the DHC, and why only the members of the DHC are able to tackle the demons. A very nice touch that I loved in the story came with the introduction of how demons in this world hate the smell of the flower Wisteria. Later on, the audience learns of an influential family who house and heal wounded members of the DHC due to their lives being saved by the Corps, their mutual partnership that grew from that with the DHC and that family's adoption of the Wisteria flower as their family crest. Small things like that really help to flesh out the world of Demon Slayer. The story and fights are engaging, the enemies and characters abilities are exciting to see clash on screen, the character's and their development is solid, the music and animation are fantastic and the mysteries/history slowly sown throughout the series leave the viewer anticipating how the story will unfold. 5/5 Stars: If you're a fan of action anime you'll love this series; and with portions of horror, supernatural, drama and the tried & true coming of age tale mixed in, there's certainly something for different viewers to enjoy as well. The series is definitely worth your time checking out.",5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"This is one of the few animes I will EVER give a 5/5. It truly deserves it.Animation, as a big time amateur artist and animator, I've become more critical of what I watch and it's animation as I hone myself to become at least mediocre. This show stylizes it's animation in such a way it makes it so, so, smooth. The flash of colors in an otherwise very dull colored show except for key features like character's hair and eyes. Especially their eyes I'm adoring the rough edged eyes. Making them look sharper and more reason to look directly into their eyes as they speak.Music is great, it fills the shounen genre really well. I cannot complain about it and episode 19? Oof, that ending was a treat from both music, and animation.Story, FINALLY, another show where they're not trying to make an immediate ""Love interest"" character like Shield Hero did with Ralphtalia. It's a simple plot, but that's it's beauty, it doesn't need fancy over the top plot. It knows what it is, and is keeping it's narrative strong with few drops in quality. Also one of the few animes I can applaud for, wow you actually shown the character's life and how others see him BEFORE the driving plot point makes him setout to do what he does. The show even has the guts to try and make us sympathize with the demons after some of them have been killed. I'm sorry, this show deserves nothing but praise. If a cynical person like me can be enthralled by a shounen, a shounen usually one of the laziest genres next to isekai. It deserves every penny it gets. Those nearly 330 5/5  (reviews at current time.) are proof enough if you even hate anime, you should watch this show. Just the fact that it tries to be anime but hasn't tried any of the easy dialogue, cheap and poorly done CGI, or just generic ""epic"" music to get people pumped up.",5

demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"As the industry standards continue their freefall past mediocrity and into glorified amateurism, Demon Slayer has instead chosen to overcome all odds to become the best seasonal Japan has managed to produce in the last several years.  This is the standard to which all shounen should be held: superb animation, inspired choreography, and character designs that are the closest to being unique I've seen in years - but without being excessive or overdone.  The story could be described as simple, but its straightforward nature is complemented by its fast and reliable pacing, consistently written characters, and tactful negotiation of its surprising emotional berth.",5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"This show so far has shown only promise. It incorporates Japanese culture quite well and in only one episode, captivates the audience with its quality of animation and fast paced story.So far I love the first two episodes and can't wait to see where it leads. As the world hasn't been properly introduced yet, i'm sure there is much in store for the main two protagonists and am keen to see how their stories are told.",5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"This anime is a straight up masterpiece. The animation, sound design, character development are all fantastic. While the core plot is a bit generic, the way that it tells the story, the characters that we follow, and the animation make this anime incredibly entertaining. Story 3/5: My biggest and only real complaint about this anime is the simplicity of the plot. By virtue of the genre itself, it's harder to come up with an interesting original concept. Basically, its about a guy who trains to kill demons so that he can avenge his family and also to turn his sister back into a human. Not too much else to say about it.Characters 5/5: Demon slayer is an anime that really rises to greatness due to the strength of the characters, specifically the amazing pure-heartedness of the main character, Tanjiro. Each character has this slight air of despair and suffering, but it doesn't stop them from doing their duties. No one really WANTS to be a demon slayer, except for maybe Inosuke. They all do it out of duty, honor, loyalty, revenge, or justice. The prevalence of evil in the world is what causes the main character to go on his journey in the first place yet it does not corrupt his pure-hearted desire to make sure no one has to suffer as he has. Part of what makes the main character so great is that he genuinely cares for others, even the enemy. He does not see his enemies as purely evil, but rather forced into it through external forces. He sympathizes with each enemy's tragic past.Art/Animation 6/5: My god this anime is absolutely beautiful. Each frame is practically its own artwork. ufotable's animation team really went all out on this and its absolutely god damn fantastic. Fight scenes come to life and the dynamic camera adds so much to your enjoyment of the fight scenes. 2 fight scenes really stand out to me as being absolutely amazing: The room shifting demon, and the spider demon. Both scenes have amazing use of dynamic camera following Tanjiro as he goes off and kicks some ass.Sound 5/5: The songs and sound design have an air of like being a samurai and living in feudal japan, and then when the action kicks up it just gains this absolutely majestic epic feeling as the sound of water and fire and swords cuts through the air and its just like FUCK YEAH SLASH THAT BITCH. God damn episode 19 was amazing.Enjoyment 5/5: The animation, the characters, the sound design all come together to make this nearly perfect anime with this amazing balance of action, drama, comedy. Also, there's this incredible amount of weight that each swing of the sword has. Thanks to the combination of the sound design and animation, every fight just feels absolutely epic. With most shounen anime, there's this emphasis on that final blow, the climax of the battle, and Demon Slayer does not disappoint when it comes to those moments.Overall 5/5: Absolute masterpiece. What more can I say?",5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"The story of Demon Slayer, at least through episode 24, has been enjoyable indeed, but the real treat this anime brings is it's visual presentations. Great designs from the get go, immersive scenery, and impressive shading can all be seen in the first few episodes. But Ufotable kept going. The combat scenes are choreographed so well. It seems like nothing is wasted in their designs. Then the best part: the artistic impressions. Water flowing from blade strokes like the blade does through it's foes, lightning striking it's own foes as quickly as the blade is drawn and sheathed. These effects are not actually present in the anime's world, but, in my opinion, immerse us viewers in ways normal fight scenes could never do.I am hoping Ufotable gets to ride this anime all the way, and CANNOT wait to see their expert designs for many, many more beautiful episodes.",5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"All I have to say is GAME CHANGING!! I am a heavy anime watcher and consider Naruto, one piece, Bleach etc.. Good ""starter"" anime for someone just getting into anime, but that's it they are just ""entry level"". And consider some of the greats to be maybe Claymore, Elfen Lied, FMA, Darker than black Etc.. But they can be a bit to dark/mature for most.. That's where DEMON SLAYER comes in if there's any current anime that's out there that almost perfectly mixes the two together its Demon slayer. HxH and My hero academia did very well in doing this as well too, but both just barely miss one or two things. Demon Slayer has insanely high potential right now and consider it the closest currently to the perfect mix that any Heavy anime watcher and Beginner watcher can enjoy. Nice mature storyline, gore but not exaggerated has good humor but not over the top and so much more. I've got high hopes for this anime, just hope they don't make the mistake of rushing out eps for the f of it .",5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"You guys. You don't even know what's coming. This manga is incredible and what's best of all is the anime has been following it pretty religiously. The animation really brings it to life. It's detailed, with the sword techniques in vibrant color. I can't say enough. I think the characters are so different from each other and they all have different backstories. It's cool to see them grow, depend on each other, and of course see their techniques evolve. This is top 10 best anime for me. I can't wait for it to be finished so I can binge it all at once. I will say that some episodes are more interesting than others in terms of visuals but that's not because of the actual animation quality but rather they needed less battle and more story. You won't be disappointed. Finally. The music is awesome too. Really fits the theme and doesn't overpower anything for me at any time. If you want to know a little about the story - There's Tanjiro who is the main character. He's uber kindhearted and friendly. His heart is probably his biggest asset and he really helps those around him grow. His sister Nezuko was turned into a demon and without giving away too much, they are fighting to return her to a human. They do this  by Tanjiro becoming a demon slayer.",5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,Was about to skip but decided to click on it anyway. Animation looks great and hope that it continues on this well. Hopefully though this is not one of the shows where he falls in love with hi sister because that will piss me off considering how much potential this show has. Would be great if he ended up marrying a princess or something and became king or found out about some hidden relative etc.Well thats all I have to say LMK if this was helpful.,5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"Love this series. Re-watched it at least 5 times through live reactions. Can't wait for upcoming seasons.This anime is very good for many reasons. Ufotable never slacks during the series which is very obvious the more you watch. The animation is amazing and consistent, all uses of cgi are good (the only show i have ever seen pulling off good cgi). The soundtrack is very good too. Each episode is interesting and I remember wanting the next episode so badly when I watched this from week to week as it was coming out.",5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"As far as adaptations go Demon Slayer is one of the better ones. It took the source material and explored it. Nearly seamlessly blending its 3d and 2d elements to enhance the battles into a dynamic roller coaster and drawing out the key moments of characters into near romantic qualities. The problem is it also stretches out elements it had no business to extend thereby jittering the pacing of the series. The story is either wonderfully paced where everything builds on itself and everything is given an appropriate amount of time to be explored, or thirty minutes of ""feel bad for x because y"". But when everything is ironed out nicely and the animations at its peak you end up with a masterclass of music and animation... at its worse you end up with a game of pong that you just want to be over :/",5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"By far my favorite manga i've read in 5 years of reading, and slowly becoming my favorite anime in 9 years of watching. The manga is definitely better than the anime, with the increase of story telling and depth (the usual) , But the anime isn't too far behind. The anime has amazing fight scenes, and puts a new ""perspective"" on anime with the use of cool camera angles, cool battle and ability animation, and really funny dialogue. Just the concept of demon slayers risking there lives and battling in a world over run by demons is intriguing to me and i'm sure others. 10/10 would recommend.",5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"I am in love with this show. The fight scenes are dramatic and invigorating, character interaction is humorous when it needs to be and serious when it’s warranted, and the art is BEAUTIFUL. Having the different breaths be represented by “paintings” that only we, the viewer, can see is amazingly unique and adds a unique flair to the show. Also having everyone use a custom tailored katana that reflects their personality is metal as f*ck. The brother-sister relationship is wholesome and goes no further than family and sexual love doesn’t ever really pop up which is good because it doesn’t especially have a place in this show and universe. There are stakes and consequences to everything that happens the moment Tanjiro steps into frame. Speaking of tanjiro, he is incredibly energetic and carries the show on his back. You always want to cheer for him and it feels awesome to see him succeed. The only real weakness that I can really identify is that the beginning few episodes have a “monster of the week” feeling that I didn’t really like and that there are frequent time-skips which kinda mess up the pacing. It doesn’t really get in the way of the show though, and the monster thing clears up when more powerful enemies show up that our main characters can’t defeat alone. Oh also our friend “lightning boi” is annoying as all hell and the scenes where he is constantly crying left a sour taste in my mouth.I have watched all 26 episodes and couldn’t wait any longer so I binged all of the available 175 chapters and it really only goes uphill from where the show ends. I am praying for a season 2 and anxiously anticipate the movie’s release.",5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"Honestly it is my opinion that this is the BEST anime thats come out in a while! The story is excellent, the characters well written, a pretty good blend of seriousness and humor, amazing animation, and the feelings it brings out is a refreshing experience. Most would say the worst part about this show is Zenitsu but even he has a decent plot and it seems like they may tone down his sporadicness come season 2. The final episode he was more of a normal character. All in all I LOVE it and highly recommend to people. I can't wait for the dvd to come out, this show has amazing rewatch ability as well. Please experience this show.Edit: I read some of the 3 and 4 star reviews, most were written it seems after only 4 episodes or so, and some of them don't even complain about the show but about how they hate having to wait week by week (which in my opinion means its doing a great job by keeping you interested. Others complain about the show because they have questions about it, while if they would have waited they would have had those questions answered, or have been able to reasonably inference the answers. Basically the jumped the gun on reviewing the show, I hope they watched it fully and hope they change their review accordingly. But in the end I am happy to see the amount of love this show has gotten from people.",5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,Okay when i said i would sacrifice my minecraft dog i went a little to far but this is really one of the best series i've ever seen.It has some godlike animation with a really cool and specical style to it (just wait until ep 19).Has the most awesome set of characters iv'e ever seen in a anime.Everything just works so well in the story and you don't get tired of it.I'm glad that the season 2 has been confirmed and i really look forward to seeing another 26 episodes i hope.It's like eating a bag of chips.The more you eat of it the better it gets.,5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"Demon Slayer is a Japanese manga series, which was published by Koyoharu Gotouge, which is his 2nd work. An anime television series adaptation by Ufotable premiered on April 6, 2019. The final episode aired on September 28, 2019. From the earliest times, the humanity knows about human-flesh eating monsters, lurking in the darkness to devour an unfortunate soul that does not trust rumors. However, the rumors also mention an elite corps of demon hunters, skilled assassins, killing demons. Demon Slayer focuses on Tanjirou Kamado, who is still very young, but is the only man in his family. One day, Tanjirou decides to go down to the local village to make a little money, selling charcoal. When he returns back, he becomes an unwilling part of these horrifying rumors: his family is slaughtered and the only survivor, his sister Nezuko, is turned into demon. For some reason, Nezuko still acts as a human, which is the reason for Tanjirou to join demon slayers and cure his sister. Will he manage to join the elite corps and cure his sister?It is, without a doubt, quite a challenge to make an interesting and new battle shounen. With so many titles that represent the genre, as well as cliché surrounding it, Kimetsu no Yaiba could have been another title, everyone will stop to hype about after the first week. However, there is something different about it, which makes it stand out. The story-line is slow, which grants enough development, the main protagonist does look like your average battle-shounen protagonist, but he is not as annoying as his counterparts, characters are actually interesting, since even supporting cast receives enough development, finally, the setting looks somewhat new, because you will not see that often a setting, describing the Taishou era. Animation wise, it is quite challenging to find even one work of ufotable with bad animation. It does look somewhat similar to Katanagatari, but not quite. Everything from character designs to action scenes looks just awesome and beautiful, an eye candy you want to never end. Sound wise, even if there is English dub one day, I would still highly recommend you to watch Demon Slayer subbed, because of many voice acting gurus, voicing this series. Even the OST fits the anime well and makes the series even more catchy.Characters is another important part, a must to make battle-shounen likeable. Kamado Tanjirou, however, does not look that promising to ‘carry’ the whole series. However, this problem is solved when he is joined by the other protagonists of the series, who together form a very likeable group of protagonist. They are interesting, because of how different they are: Tanjirou Kamado is a very trustworthy and hardworking individual, but he is a too trustful. Nezuko Kamado, Tanjirou’s sister and the only person that was able to remain human after having been turned into a demon. The noodle head Zenitsu Agatsuma is a member of the Demon Killing Corps and a traveling companion of Kamado Tanjirou. He is always scared by any noise, but he becomes a fearful enemy for the demons, when it is needed. Inosuke Hashibira is the last companion of Tanjurou and he is also a t..p.  Enjoyment wise, it is truly one of the brightest gems of this season. Kimetsu no Yaiba is one of these titles that was able to unite comedy and drama and make it interesting to watch. What I mean is that many series were trying to do that, but failed. One was intervening with the other and the end result was horrible. Here, however, just like in Gintama, it is both funny and dramatic sometimes, which makes it that good. Imagine 26 episodes of nothing but drama. This is just unreal for any person. Overall, Kimetsu no Yaiba is one of a very small amount of battle-shounen series that is actually fun to watch. The story, the art, the voice acting, the OST, I cannot think of anything, I did not like about it, nor have I ever felt bored, when I was watching this series. There are, however, some minor flaws, I feel useless to even mention. Great job, Gotouge Koyoharu. For your first animated series, Demon Slayer is quite an achievement to be proud of. A very-very weak 10/10.",5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"Demon Slayer has a lot of things going for it. A decent start, amazing visuals, good music/opening/ending and a very high quality Main Character. Its pretty much the Goblin Slayer of Shounen this season. Its somewhat gory and mature, but with some immature elements as well (mostly the other demon slayer characters)What makes the show good - I really enjoy the brother/sister relationship as it give the entire story a good end goal to strive for from the very first episode and gives many moments of feel-good atmosphere despite the fairly dark setting/atmosphere. In fact those precious moments feel all the more powerful because of the dark setting. The fighting is really enjoyable to watch as well as most of the characters.The Passion. The feelings of the characters are very real and good anime really pull us in and make the world/characters/emotions feel truly real. Demon Slayer has a lot of emotion in every plot-line as well as the setting.What lowers the enjoyment -The pacing. Sometimes its perfect and flows really well. Other times we experience a time skip. Then we get lost in the hell that many shounen anime suffer. The studio tries to draw out battles/conversations/plot-lines for way too long. Fortunately Demon Slayer is such a quality show it can overcome the slow paced areas, but it definitely hampers the show's quality and sometimes i find myself finishing an episode thinking ""wait thats it? nothing happened!"" The blonde haired character. Hes just horrible as a character and massively annoying to have to listen to as he mostly just screams and cries. I get it that this is a shounen and a childish/loud/flamboyant character is almost always present, but he just feels poorly written and throw into the story to give comic relief. Instead the relief is when his scenes are over. Fortunately there aren't that many of them as of yet.My verdict:Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba is a great show. It has few flaws and it easily overwhelms them with its great story, visuals and passion. The brother/sister bond is amazingly portrayed and gives us a true sense of what family really means.",5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"Can't heap enough praise on this series. Great story, Great characters and relational development, solid background and theory. amazing art and drawing, and fantastic fights. Each character is different and interesting, not just weird for the sake of being ""different"".  And the character's maintain their personalities, unlike many that have them change at the drop of a hat. You see real character development, not just personality changes that leave you thinking ""wut just happened?""This show raises the bar on what defines a quality anime, well worth the watch. Warning: first episode is dark. it sets the stage for the motivations behind the main heroes. So if it's a bit too dark for you, stick with it. It gets better, and the whole theme through the series is a positive one.",5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"Holy cow, where do I even start? The animation quality is leagues above everything else. It's so rare for me to see an anime with such good animation every episode that I wonder how much money went into the production of this. I feel like every episode has 3-4x the budget of your typical anime. The visual quality never disappoint and I love the artistic direction. UFOTABLE is my new favorite studio.",5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"I have been waiting for a really good anime to come out since attack on titans taking days. This anime is soooo good. Gave me so much chills, the plot is everything I love it!!! The animes that has come out lately lacks a good addictive story line so I'm glad this one came out. There's so much potential, the first episode will capture you right away and you know an anime is good if you get hooked right off the bat. 100% recommend watching this, no regrets. I can't wait for the next episode, currently on 19 and so far the best episode yet! Had to rewatch it. Anyways you will love this, I promise.",5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"I was hesitant to watch this series because I feel like every new anime that comes out with this kind of premise is either cliche, bland, overly ecchi, poorly done, or all of the above... but booooyyyy/giiiiiirrrrrllll, I'll tell you what I FEEL SO STUPID FOR NOT GIVING THIS SERIES A CHANCE SOONER. I was instantly impressed and captivated with the beauty and design of this show. I haven't seen top notch animation like this in a good while. I was then impressed about how quickly they got into the plot and story-line. This show is a real attention grabber! The plot itself is so dark/tragic, but somehow with the characters they're able to keep the story-line so fun/uplifting. Highly recommend! PLEASE DO YOURSELF A FAVOR and WATCH THIS SHOW!",5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"I have few words to describe this show other than as an animated masterpiece. The storyline is complex and on the darker end, with beautifully crafted character development. Every single one of the characters is important, and any scene they appear in adds to my understanding of their past and personality. And don't get me started on the visuals. Every scene is beautiful, like a literal masterpiece. I don't want it to end and if they don't tie the story up at the end of these 26 episodes (which I don't think they will based on the progress made by ep 19) I would love to see more seasons. Immaculate. That's all I can say",5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"It's not fair how much this anime gets right. Now let me start off with saying that I'm not too much into anime as I have only really gotten into it as of last year. That being said, I have watched classic movies and shows that most people really enjoy and seem to take a strong bond to. This particular show however.. man. It has absolutely astonishing writing, better than any video game or show has ever even been close to. The art style and Tokugawa period setting never gets old. Each character has a carefully scripted background making it so they all feel different and absolutely no one is disliked. Even the random villains the main character faces all have their own stories to tell, and when he finally triumphs over them its always a mixture of sadness and happiness..The thing that really takes this anime over the top for me, making it my favorite of all time. Putting it above Spirited Away, Naruto, One Hero, Cowboy Bebop and many of my other all time classic favorites is its pure sense of engagement. I have never been more engrossed and had that feeling of ""being there"" more than I do in this show, the only thing that really could compare is that same feeling when you watch the first episode of SAO. It's addictive. I genuinely love and adore all of the characters on this show, good and bad. Seeing the main character grow with the viewer and get stronger and stronger not due to some outside factor, but under his own will is amazing. The pacing is fantastic. But as I said above, it's the shows attention to detail in every character they put on screen and their personal story and how it ties into the main heros quest is the real gem of this show. TLDR:I've never seen a show, book, or movie with this kind of writing. It's a whole new way to engage an audience without the need for action all the time. The animation is phenomenal. The character development is astonishing. 20/10 Watch this show.",5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"It is a heart warming story about a very complicated brother-sister bond that originated from tragic circumstances isolated out in the woods. The brother keeps his ball gagged sister in a box that he carries on his back and only brings her out at night when he needs her. He does this in order to prevent her from eating random strangers after a stranger ate her and gave her an infection. The in order to seek revenge on the stranger, he indoctrinates himself into a cult that chops baddies into pieces using katanas. During his indoctrination he leaves his incapacitated and victimized sister with a strange old man who successfully brain washers her.",5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"One of the best anime ever produced. Every episode makes you feel emotions from all ranges. Few anime have a protagonist that truly makes your skin crawl and fills you with rage. Each episode is filled with beauty and leaves you wanting for more. They never use cheap tactics and unnecessary cliff hangers to keep you coming back. Episodes are taken to their conclusion and you return because of the want to see more, not a need to see completion. Everything about this anime is wonderful.",5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,Animation on point. Music on point. I really enjoy the character design and the world design. A time or two per episode the scenery animation looks nearly real I've had to double take multiple time... There isn't unnecessary prolonged fighting sequences everything combat related seems reasonable in this world. Characters are very compelling and as dark as the show can be it seems pretty light. 5/5 stars,5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"((DO NOT READ SPOILER TILL AFTER EP 4!))This anime, I have to say.., Is the  BEST ANIMATED ANIME I've ever seen!! The fighting scenes seem as if they are in 3D! I feel like every anime I watch from now on will feel poor-qualitied! I wish to cosplay so many characters!(Listed Below) I just love the relationships and the current antagonists and enemies, they are factored so well, and the MC is not too OP!Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideI would go broke to cosplay Sabito or Tanjiro! I hated Sabito's death scene!! Bring my soft baby back for more scenes!!",5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"Pros- Hits the ground running with an amazing first episode- Really unique art style that works well for the atmosphere- Great setting and world-building, feels like a folktale- Unique characters, each person has their own personality and is given the right dialogue- Each episode is structured very well, by the end you either get a cliffhanger or a really satisfying feeling- Can we take a second to appreciate the animation of the special moves each slayer gets. Its honestly dope.- The plot so far has a great arc to it. MC wants to make his sister human again, has to search for the person who can make demons to learn more. Simple, but really interesting.  - OP is really good in my opinion, also the sound design and soundtrack really makes the whole folktale vibe pop.- Doesn't shy away from more vulgar themes.- I'm interested in how they're gonna make senses into a theme. For example, Tanjiro has a really good sense of smell, the Yellow haired kid has great hearing, etc. Haven't really seen that all that much before.Cons- Doesn't really explain why Nezuko can survive without eating flesh. It'll probably get covered more later but its kind of annoying having to play along with the fact that she can just sleep to regain strength. To be honest they're doing a really great job so far and any other cons I can think of would be easily cleared up in future episodes. I highly recommend this one, its definitely the best spring anime this season.",5

demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"I've been following Kimetsu no Yaiba since the manga originally premiered 3 years ago in Weekly Shonen Jump. While the premise is simple, the execution has always been fantastic with a great story, great characters, great fight scenes, you name it. It has everything you can ask for in a shonen series.The manga was a little rough around the edges in terms of artwork, but that's expected when this is the writer's (Koyoharu Gotōge) first series that she's ever worked on, and it not only got serialized in Jump, but it ended up getting this anime adaptation by Ufotable, the studio that brought us Kara no Kyoukai, Fate/Zero, and Fate/stay night Unlimited Blade works and Heaven's Feel!Kimetsu no Yaiba is easily the best new series to come from Jump in a long time! Highly recommended!",5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"The art directors and writers of this anime are knocking it out of the park week after week. The story draws you in immediately and unfolds in a manner that keeps you excited and drooling like a hungry demon for more. Tanjiro's kind heart, strong spirit and misfortune make him the hero you will get behind root for with all your emotion. The well devised storytelling is complimented by fun action, humor, unique character design, a cool illustrative style, and shot angles that create beautiful visuals that are fun and exciting. Every frame is well constructed, bringing into clear focus how much care is put in by the artists and directors. Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba has got the special sauce and I hope the production team keeps this one dipped because this is anime is A-1!!",5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"I went into the first episode completely blind. The only thing I knew was LOTS of people online were excited for it. The cover artwork looked cool and instantly grabbed my attention. The animation and style of the anime looks impressive (at least to me) and of course with the first episode it introduces the MC. I'm sure to some he comes off as generic and boring, but clearly we are going to get a lot of character growth as the series progresses. I'm really looking forward to following the series as I do have high expectations for it based off what I saw in the first episode and from what I saw in the opening theme song as well.",5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"I remember reading the manga few years ago and just hoping it's going to become an anime. Honestly, the anime adaptation looks amazing, voice are not far fetch from what I imagined or find suit and so far the sound track and animation are great.Also, the anime character adaptations do stick with the manga and I am so glad they did (therefore I was actually able to recognise that I read the manga).",5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"One of the better anime to come out in the last couple years, despite some serious plot flaws, and thanks to some exceptional art and animation. The series starts off with a brutal bang. The protagonist's family is attacked by demon(s). He's survived because he was not at home. All the rest are dead, save his sister. She's suffered a fate worse than death, as she's been turned into a demon herself. Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideThis is a bit disconcerting, as demons can only survive by eating humans. But through some inexplicable twist, Nezuko can somehow miraculously thwart her demonic nature, by sticking a hunk of bamboo in her mouth.  Her devoted  brother, Tanjiro, vows to reverse the demonic transformation, willing to go to any lengths to do so. Which means hunting down the nasty boss daddy demon, and maybe asking him nicely to turn Nezuko back. We don't know because the narrative never gets that far. In yet another inexplicable twist, Tanjiro decides that joining an organization sworn to kill demons would be the natural route to find this guy. Why he doesn't think they won't immediately off his sister is beyond me. Even more puzzling is that when she is exposed, the Demon Slayers don't immediately do just that. Yeah, it's pretty implausible, but please stick with the series, as it does have it's redeeming values.  Tanjiro as a character gets some decent development. Nezuko, not so much, but then she's not entirely 2 dimensional, either. The designs for the various demons they encounter are the real stars here, and they tend to get a lot deeper treatment and development than most of the protagonists. The supporting cast are pretty much your typical shounen motley crew. With one exception, there's not much original or stand out here. The one exception, though, jumped near to the top of my ""most love to hate"" characters. God, I wish they had killed Zenitsu off in the same episode he first appeared in, he's such an irritating little [email protected] It would have been so satisfying to have seen some demon munching his entails.You don't want to watch Demon Slayer for the plot or the characters anyway. The artwork all around is top notch, especially the character designs. They aren't ground-shatteringly original, but there is something about them that is above and beyond the usual, uninspired, shounen designs. Background work is inspired though, and lends much to the overall atmosphere of the episodes. Whether in a woods, the mountains, or a city, they are a crucial part of the narrative. The animation is also a cut above. While the action scenes get the greatest, and therefore the most inspired, attention, check out the other scenes as well. There were a lot of times I saw something that might not have seemed too consequential, but it made me stop and say ""Nice Job!"" And the CGI work is to be highly commended. The other studios will be studying Demon Slayer, for sure. The voice actors did a nice job of conveying the emotions of a scene, without going too over the top, where you frequently see other shounens jumping the shark. With the issues in the narrative, it's hard to give the director too much credit, but given what the writers gave him to work with, he did the best he could. It's apparent that he had the most say in the action scenes, and those are done very, very well. Dialog is well done, flows smoothly, and is emotionally congruent with what is happening in the scenes. Another kudo for the director was his use of the soundtrack. It's used very well to set the atmosphere of almost every scene, and I can't remember any where the soundtrack detracted from what was happening on-screen.Other than the messed up narrative, almost everything else about this series impressed me with it's quality. But even as messy as the narrative was, I walked away looking forward to there being another season. If I could, Demon Slayer would get 84/100. A very solid 4 star effort overall.",4
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"This anime captivates the viewers very early on. It is a pretty fast passed moving anime which I personally enjoy. I wish I could give it 4.5 stars only because of certain plot holes..Spoilers ahead:I really disliked how Tanjiro missed his opportunity to take the blood sample from the lower 5 demon. They just never mentioned it and just kept moving? Like what??? Other than that and him not getting a new face mask, I am greatly pleased with this anime and can't wait for future seasons/movies. -zGCalyps0",5
hunter-x-hunter,"The first couple of episodes might seem kinda corny too some and yeah they are somewhat generic, but stick with it.This isn't some kids show, it's actually very mature and dark(just the right amount though)It has an excellent story and doesn't have to rely on explosions or huge breasted women to keep going, it has a bit of everything really it's like a more modern version of Dragonball, an adventure.But instead of being all about Gon other characters get the spotlight for a good while too everyone get's an adequate amount of character development, even people who die shortly after appearing.Seriously give this a go, I have no idea why it's not as popular as the likes of Naruto and One Piece it's way more interesting than both in my opinion.",5
hunter-x-hunter,"- WRITTEN WHILST STILL WATCHING, AT EPISODE 65 -The first word that comes to mind when I think about Hunter x Hunter is undoubtedly: VARIETY. With everything from insane, heart-raising action to comedy so ridiculous that I laugh alone in my room on numerous occasions; Hunter x Hunter is an anime that quickly shot to my number 1 favorite and only secures it's place more determinedly with every episode.At this point, although still ongoing, I'm roughly halfway through HxH and I've loved every single minute of it. That's because in this show, every minute matters. You can't look away without missing something crucial, hilarious or just generally entertaining. I was a late comer to the HxH bandwagon and after around 10 episodes, I was sorely angered with myself for leaving it this late. All I can say now is thank heavens I finally gave this anime a shot. NEWCOMERS. DO NOT BE PUT OFF BY THE LENGTH. WHEN YOU START WATCHING; IT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER ANYMORE. Where I first found myself concerned as to whether I'd have the time or motivation to catch up with this anime, I now find myself worried about catching up and having to wait a week for each episode! And man, do those episodes fly by. The best anime are the ones that make it impossible to say 'okay, that's enough for now'. The array of interesting and unique characters is what really makes this series. HxH is not afraid to go with the cliche, make fun of the cliche, experiment with the dark and creepy, the light and fluffy, and everything in between. With 2 adorable yet terrifyingly powerful protagonists and their ever-changing company, you're guaranteed to come across multiple characters that you love, hate or just plain can't get your head around. But even without the constantly growing cast, Gon and Killua really do make this a special anime. Watching the two grow (albeit quite quickly with the pace of the anime) and experiencing all the WONDERS OF FRIENDSHIP AND SELF DISCOVERY is easily the main reason for my love of this anime. Not forgetting, of course, creepy-ass perv Hisoka on the side is just the cherry on the cake.Overall this anime is just plain fun. It's addictive, interesting, varied and entertaining in every sense of the word. It really is an anime that has something for everyone. WATCH IT.",5
hunter-x-hunter,"Hunter X Hunter is a remake of the classic anime that aired in the mid 90's and it follows the manga storyline.The story is about Gon Freecss whose goal is to find his father Ging who is a renowned double star hunter.Along the way he meets Kurapika, A sole survivor of the Kurta clan who was exterminated by the mafia group Phantom Troupe led by Chrollo Lucilfer, Leorio, A hunter aiming to be a doctor and Killua who is a hunter in the elite Zoldyck family of assassins.Together they set out to take the Hunter Exam and Gon's quest to become a legendary hunter begins.The storyline itself is complex with a huge cast and an understandable approach of the history of the series.This anime has large acclaims of continuing the storyline after the Greed Island Arc. Overall a fantastic anime series that has just bought to be shown here on Crunchyroll",5
hunter-x-hunter,"I don't make that statement lightly.  Yes, I am quite biased, but I don't give the series such reverance just 'cause.There is a reason that Togashi can take multiple year+ long hiatus's with the manga, and yet still have a loyal following.HunterxHunter is just that excellent.  The series is a subversion of typical shounen tropes, playing in blue and orange morality.  You root for the villians in many ways just as much as the leads.  You don't have insane boring speeches on morality or 'right and wrong', instead you have an exploration of a world.  And the fighting dynamics are immensly complex.The ""power of friendship"" isn't going to save you in HxH, but wit and guile shall.The story does start off slow, but even before you are introduced to nen, it is easy to see how HxH is different.And the Chimera Ant Arc makes it clear just how different.  In many ways I feel calling that arc 'shounen' does a disservice to it.  No shounen works so hard on charactarization of the villians.  At all.  You instead tend to get quick mash ups and 'flash backs' for a never before relevant back story and some sappy 'you're now good!' moment.  HxH doesn't indulge in such nonsense.  Character arcs are developed organically, according to the established nature of the character.  It's story telling 101, something often lost in today's 'action dominated' world.If you're looking for a non-stop action anime, HxH will often feel anti-climactic.  That's the point.Finally the music, and animation given to the arc in this remake pays full respect to the source material.  I can't imagine what it would be like to have to wait each week to find out what will come next, I understand how Song of Ice and Fire readers feel watching the show...Regardless of if you read the manga or not, HunterxHunter is a work that deserves significantly more appreciation for the beauty of the series. Togashi doesn't need to write another page in his life and still live quite comfortably.  (He's got Yu Yu Hakusho, Level E, and is married to Naoko Takeuchi.  He does not need to work).That gives him ultimate freedom in crafting HxH.  Freedom he takes, while we wait.And we wait.  But we will keep waiting, so long as he keeps writing.  HxH is just that excellent.",5
hunter-x-hunter,"First of all I want to point out that this anime has a slow start and progression. I stopped watching it a little bit before I reached 15 episodes, but I continued one day because I figured I should keep going. The main characters don't get actual power progression until very later on, but it keeps you reeled with it's beautiful animations [Madhouse] THE ANIMATION IS ALWAYS ON POINT EVERY SINGLE EPISODE AND ONLY GET'S BETTER THROUGH 130+ episodes. I've never said once ""Man the animation there doesn't look that great."" or ""The guy in the background isn't that detailed"". And the results of the slow progression rewards you beyond belief, you'll be taken through so many loops and emotions it will make you question the most explicate of details. The Chimera Ant arc (The latest and best arc) is EXTREMELY dark, it hits you out of nowhere in this bright world of Hunter x Hunter, and it stays a dark world from there on out, and it's amazing. It's a Shōnen that doesn't really abide to the Shōnen rules, and you'll like that for the better. I watch alot of Shōnen so I've been around the block quite a few times, but believe me when I tell you this is probably one of the best decisions I ever made to get involved with this insanely incredible anime.",5
hunter-x-hunter,"It starts off like any other light-hearted shonen anime. Then... an uneasy feeling. Murderous children raised on torture and suffocating control, an entire clan, man, woman, and child wiped out except for one sole survivor, unique and interesting characters start dying like flies left and right- WHAT IS GOING ON? There aren't any happy endings here folks, you're watching hunter x hunter. And you couldn't be more entertained if you tried. An absolute masterpiece and how any manga adaptation should be done. top notch voice acting, animation, and storytelling lay the foundation. A unique, heavily expounded upon combat system and cast make this one of if not the  most involved watches you will ever take part in. And best of all? literally just two episodes of filler. very obvious, very skippable filler at that.live it, love it, start binge watching now! NOW! I can't say enough good things about hunter x hunter 2011.",5
hunter-x-hunter,"Sometimes it's almost hard to take your mind off the insane battles long enough to get and laugh at the occasional zingers. The show almost never fails to deliver the right balance and contrast in emotional highs and lows, carefree sentimentality and seriousness. When Hunter x Hunter does fail to satisfy immediately (as in the brutally slow narrated part of the Chimera Ant arc) you'll still find yourself dumbstruck by the weird technical analysis of each motive, attack, and response of each battle, often backed up with a deep analysis of the underlying psychological and emotional struggles the characters are going through, and also often accompanied by absurdly detailed engineering illustrations or other cerebral interjections. It all flows together so smoothly it's almost addictive. No -- it IS addictive. And it's hard to knock what basically amounts to brutally cliffhanging suspense. Especially when it has you feverishly scrambling to view the next episode, and the next, and the next, until you realize you just Hunter x Hunter'd the night away and it's time to ""wake up"" already.There are numerous power pay-offs that will have you cheering for your favorite characters, but sometimes when the story seems to drag you realize it's just the tone and the setting. When there's so much big stuff going on overhead you almost don't want to spend the time paying attention to the little soul-searching moments of seemingly unimportant minor characters. If you're impatient, you might find yourself yelling out loud at the apparently oblivious and deranged little characters who have been hogging the screen for several episodes. That in itself is really funny. But all of that super-heavy emotionalism is perhaps the show's greatest strength. That and the puzzles, twists, power engineering, and constant deep strategizing coming from all sides at once all the time. The art? Oh, that. Well, the artwork glitters and gleams with a sort of weird combination of crisp newness and almost retro-styled, psychedelic shimmering and sparkling effects. The animation never seems flat or boring, everything ""pops"". Every last ounce of human effort is squeezed into every frame. When you get to the narration part of the Chimera Ant arc, you're going to feel like tearing the screen out of the wall because it's just. So. Slow. But it actually gets meta-humorous how over-the-top the narrator is in giving every little thing that's happening its own little world of the utmost, self-centered importance. This is the first anime I've watched that has actually had me cackling in madness.",5
hunter-x-hunter,"Hunter x Hunter is the definition of perfection. The characters, music, visuals, story line and art style are all astonishing.Visuals The visuals stay nothing less than mind blowing. Absolutely amazing animation. A lot of anime's in this genre, especially ones that are based around a lot of combat and go over 100 episodes, tend to get a little sloppy with presentation after a while. However Hunter x Hunter makes all those anime's look like trash when comparing them.Music The music nailed everything. I listen to Hunter x Hunter music everyday, and never get bored of it. Some OST's are so emotional, tears run down your face from just hearing them. Others are so epic, it's as if it forces you to turn you volume to full so you can appreciate and experience the awesomeness of a piece.characters There is not a single character that i ever felt was annoying or had no purpose or were not developed enough. Even the smaller roles and extras, all had so much detail into their design and personality. This anime makes you really get to know every single person and have some sort of relationship with them.Protagonists The four protagonists: Gon, Killua, Kuapika and Leorio are the heart and soul of this anime. Especially Gon and Killua. Seeing the two total opposites make a tight relashionship, and watching it grow is really the bread and butter of the story. One coming from a happy childhood and another from brutal torture; there was nothing to make this any better. They all have their goals and dreams and its amazing watching them develop through their many adventures with and without each other.Storyline The story line is on a different level to anything i have ever read, seen or watched in my lifetime. The story is so mind blowing, so shockingly elaborate, you will never be bored. For a 148 episodes, to never have one of them bore you seems impossible, however this one does it to perfection. The contrast of moods and genres change so swiftly it all works together perfectly. The beginning feels like your watching a happy family friendly anime. But by episode 50, it becomes so gory, so violent, so intense, even adults look away or get extremely hype. Morals The greatest aspect of this is that its not just a fight against good and evil. Sometimes to roles of evil swap between the protagonists and their rivals.All the characters are human and suffer through difficulties of life. Whatever those are, it can make someone a good person or a bad person. Watching the righteous and the unrighteous swap roles is really breath taking. It even makes you question your own goodness, or whether if we as a human race have any at all. Conclusion After watching this anime, it is hard to watch anything else in its genre, as everything looks unpolished and unfinished in comparison. I rated it 5/5, as i feel nothing i have watched, can top it in the aspects of characters, visuals, music and art style. Hunter x Hunter is the best anime out there.",5
hunter-x-hunter,"So by this point many of the tropes that are common in shonen are annoyances to me. This is why Hunter x Hunter was such a wonderful surprise. The many tropes that this show avoids include.1. Every problem can be solved by training2. Beat me once, shame on me and I'm guaranteed to win next time3. Hard work > Experience4. Everything is stronger when it's a beam attack5. The next enemy will be just strong enough for us to scrape by.6. The guys we're fighting now are simply the best around, until next arc7. You're either evil or redeemable8. The main character is the one that will resolve thisand many many others.This anime is beyond refreshing, it's spectacular. As of this moment it's one of my top three anime of all time. Because it's not just good shonen. It's top quality anime.",5
hunter-x-hunter,"After having only watched this anime three days ago and finally making it to the present state of the show all i can say is that this show is absolutely amazing, with both very interesting characters, and a story with so much depth and creativity to make some say ""Just one more episode"" over and over again! (another plus side some may consider is there is no filler, i personally wanted a few filler episodes to be honest though) the music is well made, the voice cast is very good... i honestly can't think of anything bad to say about this anime. all and all just brilliantWill edit this ""review"" eventually. A byproduct of an uncontrollable state of euphoria.",5
hunter-x-hunter,"I was in a pretty dark place when I found Hunter x Hunter. I was having trouble laughing and seeing the positivity in life. However, when I started watching this anime I began smiling again, and I couldn't help but fall in love with the characters and plot. The first couple episodes are pretty corny, but as the story progresses it gets better and better. I could never handle long running anime like  One Piece, Bleach, and Naruto, yet I adore this one. The anime is long but each season is a whole new story with a whole new set of interesting characters ready to greet you. My favorite aspect of the series is that even the secondary characters get back story, and you can't help but liking them even when they are the villain. The complexity and thought in this series is wonderful and worth watching all the episodes.",5
hunter-x-hunter,"Don't read these reviews to convince you to watch the anime - stop now and watch it this instant. It has a high rating across the internet and is one of my most favourite shows. Don't be fooled by the 'weak' looking characters because it was those very reasons why I never touched this show or not decide to watch it. But I regret not having watched this any sooner. Heck, the characters are amazing and the storyline and arcs never cease to amaze me. If i were to order my top 3 shounen HxH would be at number 1 then FMAB followed by one piece. This is a gem and the only negative is the fact that it ended so, by all means go and watch this already.",5
hunter-x-hunter,"It s not just the story in the case that grows in to this amazing series, but the animation is something to marvel at, it just turns into this incredible art work that you can't help but stare at. There is 150 million reviews with over 5 stars on why you should start watching hunter x hunter, its nothing something to miss while you still have time to catch up, we are in this for the long haul. This is truly an amazing series, I do pray that we get many many more seasons, 9 or 10 would be fine with me.",5
hunter-x-hunter,"Let me start by saying I wrote this show off for the longest time. The art-style looked a bit flat from the promo-images, the characters looked like a mish-mash of stereotypes, and the main protagonist used a freaking fishing pole as his primary weapon. It looked like pretty generic shonen-schlock aimed at the elementary and middle-school age bracket. I was wrong. The series is up-beat and happy, especially early on, with a lot of the typical shonen themes of 'Friendship and Determination' to cover everything. The oft-pictured group looks on the surface like rag-tag stereotypes, with a super optimistic, somewhat naive protagonist, the 'last of his clan' on a quest for vengeance, the aloof skater, and the easily roiled businessman. The first two seem painfully generic and the last two kind of quirky at best. Not helped is the fact that it pretty much starts out on an extended obstacle course for its first arc. Lots of wacky vignettes and odd challenges, but not much in the way of a story beyond 'go for the prize at the end'. But through this arc, you get to know the characters, get a little insight into where they came from, get a feel for the scope of the kind of crazy things this setting can possibly throw at them. The secondary cast is every bit as wildly varied as you'd expect, but there are surprisingly few 'annoying schtick' characters. As time goes on you start to see the characters fleshed out nicely: The protagonist is not nearly as naive as he first seemed, the greedy businessman has a very distinct goal for his greed and a surprisingly charitable side, the aloof character is part of a well known and very dangerous family with tons of baggage to explore, and so forth. The group doesn't even remain a group for the arbitrary reasons many shonen shows have them do so. Some of them with their own goals split off to pursue them separately, and some go to catch up when they realize they can't keep pace with the methods their companions are using. The characters are given room to grow and show all sorts of facets of their personality in ways that feel natural and very fulfilling.  The animation starts off pretty good, and becomes simply amazing as time goes on. I'd say it hits its true peek during the next to last arc, with scenes that had me tense as I followed the character's struggle with built up hopes, determination pushed to the most unhealthy extremes, and surprisingly harsh lessons in mortality.  The emotional roller coaster the characters go through in this arc in particular are some of the best I've seen in anime ever, and the culmination in episode 135 brought me to actual tears in a way that nothing has since I was a kid watching 'The Land Before Time' for the first time. The entire show is seriously worth watching JUST to get to that point, in my opinion. My wife had very little context on the show, and rolled her eyes when I insisted she sit down for that one episode. By the end she was bawling and I was right back at that same point all over again. Don't spoil it for yourself though, watch at least the arc leading up to that point for the full effect, I promise your time will be well spent. I learned over the course of the last two arcs that the creator, Yoshihiro Togashi, has recently had some pretty severe health problems, and never put out the manga at a particularly fast pace even before then. While he does have plans to continue the series, and plans in place even should the worst happen, the fact of the matter is that this run of the anime is over for the foreseeable future. This is both a sad thought, and a somewhat reassuring one. The series ends with a peek into the scope of the places it could go, and a feeling of accomplishment for how far it's come. It doesn't leave you hanging on a cliff (Heh), but it did leave me curious to find out more. For those of you who want to see a long-running story line done well, without the worry of going through an archive binge only to run into a wall once you catch up, this series is a perfect way to enter a new fandom. So add it to your que, and get crunching. There will definitely be Something to Satisfy all tastes~",5
hunter-x-hunter,"my review title says it all. at more than 1100 reviews everyone else had already put in their two cents and there are a few very nicely done ones, so i'll just say this is the only thing worth turning on the tv for nowadays (actually i watch it on my pc, since it's not receiving air time here in cali, but it's hooked up on my tv, so ....). disregard the rather deceptively sweet-looking poster for the show -- this is as dark as they come for an anime not receiving a teen+17 rating. all i can say is, you might have better use for your time than watching this 130+ epi series, but once you do decide to invest yourself in it, it is one helluva ride.",5
hunter-x-hunter,"Ignore the Kanye jab. But seriously if you've seen Full Metal Alchemist and seen how well a remake can be done...this is SO much better in terms of full ""remake"" impact. The original anime is great (really really great), but this one is alot longer with a more concrete + fast paced following of the manga.Also people who are saying it has slowed down are quite wrong. I've read the manga and the buildup I'm having internally for the Chimera Ant Arc is killing me. Trust me start watching now. The best fights of the entire anime will literally be starting the next episode and I cannot wait. 1. These fights are not in the original anime.2. These fights were horribly drawn in the manga.3. The animation for Hunter x Hunter 2011 is some of the most fluid and beautiful looking animations out there. The fights scenes are totally insane already.In sum...This anime has been great from the start and just keeps getting BETTER.Also just so you know that I'm not just some raving ""fight"" loving anime fanboy...you should know what really makes Hunter X Hunter the best is its intricate undertone of darkness. Just the way that this show makes you think about what it takes to lose humanity, what it takes to change, what it means to be a person. There's really nothing else like this anime. Sorry for the ramble but episode 110 really got me excited.",5
hunter-x-hunter,"I, like other people, judged this anime from the get go - and didn't even bother watching the first episode. I saw the cover picture and just was like ""how on earth can this be popular on crunchyroll?"" and just left it at that. Months later one of my university friends had mentioned that this was currently her favorite anime and I, being the ever curious kid, decided to give it a go. Damn, was I wrong about this one, boy oh boy was I. I have no doubt in my mind that this is one of the best animes out so far - excelling at everything from it's story line to its amazing characters!Please give it a go - its worth your while ^_^",5
hunter-x-hunter,"I think this has become my favorite anime of all time, partially because of nostalgia, and partially because it's that awesome. The first anime I ever got into was Dragonball Z, in middle school. Hunter x Hunter appeals to me now in the same way Dragonball Z used to when I was younger. It's not as 'do the right thing because its the right thing to do' though. In fact, a lot of times, it's pretty fucked up, but it's still so light-hearted that your morality doesn't take a hit. I can't really describe how much I love this anime.",5
hunter-x-hunter,"When I first watched this I thought it was some bright and happy kiddy show... I was wrong.Amazing story - Really good and entertaining arcs, which kept me on the edge of my seat.Characters - The main characters are all amazing. You will have your favourite/s. Mine was def Killua due to the amount of bad ass scenes which had me pausing the video due to me having to have to take a breather. All the characters have a background which is discussed quite a bit in the anime. In addition, some of the villains were so damn good, I was constantly wondering if a certain character was good or bad due to their actions with our MC's.Overall - I really recommend this masterpiece of an anime. It was an amazing watch and I am sure to watch this again!",5
hunter-x-hunter,"If you are a beginner to this anime, don't think twice. Just start watching. Tell yourself to make it past the hunter exam arc. I feel like the anime just gets better and better with each episode (not one of them was boring, no fillers, no misunderstandings,, no big breasted women and fast well-thought out pacing) This anime has made me laugh like crazy, stopped my heart with excitement for six episodes continuously and weep as though I had lost everyone I ever knew. Four key things are perfect in this anime - 1)  the writing or the story or the dialogue whatever you call it 2) the animation and the details  3) voice acting and realistic emotions portrayed (shout out to Knov's and Meruem's voice actors for epic scenes in episodes 106 and 135. shudder... such beautiful scenes) and 4) the character development of each and every single person (seriously it's mind blowing how genius the author was).  If I haven't convinced you enough, just give it a chance for falling in love with that beautiful face Killua has. (he is such a badass, you will thank me later) And if you are a returning hunter x hunter fan, you must be wanting to pass on the love or must be going through withdrawal now that the anime is over. But fear not, we shall keep hoping that we will meet again and that Togashi keeps drawing. A silent salute to you all.",5
hunter-x-hunter,"Hunter x Hunter looks childish, I admit, that's what first popped into my mind. But trust me, as I stuck with this I became emotionally attached, and when it ended, I was completely devastated.Please don't over look this, please continue watching it, you'll be so amazed. It's variety as a show is what put it at the top for me. The characters, even if they are a little op, stick with you, and trust me, it's one of those shows you'll never forget. I would recommend Hunter x Hunter to anyone who watches anime, the type of genre they prefer wouldn't matter because HxH has something for everyone. This is one show that you won't regret watching.",5
hunter-x-hunter,"Simply put, this is the best anime series on Crunchyroll. Hands down. Based on the manga by Yoshihiro Togashi and animated brilliantly by Studio Madhouse, Hunter x Hunter (2011) is a captivating anime series that simply feels different from any other shonen series, while still remaining staying true to the classic shonen formula. The show contains the familliar elements of friendship, adventure, effort and victory that are present in any shonen, but instead of taking the battle-heavy route that is so commonly seen in other shonen series like One Piece, Naruto or Dragon Ball, Hunter x Hunter instead places just as much if not more emphasis on themes normally seen in human dramas: character development, emotionnal and philosophical dilemmas, trickery, deceit and cunning against otherwise overwhelming forces, etc. This isn't very visble during the first arc, but as the series progresses, the pulse-pounding action-filled battles are just as often accompagnied with nerve-racking emotionnal rollercoasters rides. A must watch for any fan of anime who wants more than just: ""let's beat up the bad guy"".",5
hunter-x-hunter,"Put bluntly, just watch this anime. No it's not over hyped, it's simply that well written. All of the characters have some sort of development and you will feel for them as the story goes on. Hunter explores many dark themes as well, it's not just some kiddy show. It makes you question things about yourself, and look into morality of humanity as a whole. For me personally the show really shone a new light in my mind and how I view the world. It painted a picture of humanity and it's struggles perfectly and showed me something that I can't articulate with words. This show really is something special to me and I hope you go watch it and enjoy it as much as I did.",5
hunter-x-hunter,"While countless women and men were watching shows like Lost and Survivor, I was in my room watching anime. I know some of you were the same. Remember the original Hunter x Hunter? The original 90's anime was great. Good character development, excellent plot, comedy, etc were what made the first series so great. THIS SERIES IS NOT THE FIRST SERIES. It leaves the first series in the dust. As I watched every episode, I felt closer and closer to the characters. I expected something great. A nice remake of an old anime for a new generation. What I got was my life RUINED!!!!! The animation is beautiful. The japanese voice actors are perfect. Incredible fights, hilarious comedy, striking backdrops, and a real sense of adventure are simply a few things that make this near-perfect anime so amazing. It will make you not want to go to work or school and abandon everything for the world of Gon and Ging Freecss. VIEWER BEWARE. There is no anime-rehab. You are watching at your own risk. Anime this good should have a warning.",5
hunter-x-hunter,"An amazing storyline,internal struggles with awesome fights, sums up hxh. epic fight scenes with conflicts that question who you are as a human being, and the strategies holy shit this anime just the best... ﻿but the manga remains the better medium for HxH in my opinion. Togashi gives no shits about having seinen-type violence in a shounen series, It just gets brutal, also, the manga shows a lot more subtleties to the characters than the anime has shown.",5
hunter-x-hunter,"I didn't watch this show until now because the cover art appears a bit childish.  Boy was I wrong!  This series have some of the best characters.  Many of them are lovable whether they are good or ""evil"".  I was a big fan of Yu Yu Hakusho and I'm glad to see that this series is just as good as YYH - Togashi is as imaginative as ever, and the story is full of unpredictability - which is a great thing because you never know what to expect from him.  HxH also has a good balance of really dark and light hearted moments (some even hilarious).  I was never bored when I was watching this series.",5
hunter-x-hunter,"This is a remake of the 1999 series and because i watched the original i was skeptical. In no way did this show disappoint! The villian Hisoka is like no other i have seen, being tagged as creepy, bizarre, and a possible paedophile. Main characters are Gon Freecss, Killua Zoldyck, Leorio, and Kurapika.    Gon is a boy of 12 leaving his island to become a Hunter and find his dad. Finding his dad is no small feat; however, because his dad just happens to be the world's top Hunter. Gon quickly becomes friends with Killua, Kurapika, and Leorio. Rarely have I seen such a well matched and heartwarming pair as Gon and Killua. My words to descride: Gon- monster, beast, stubborn, simple, warm- Killua- monster, assassin, shadow, protective, loyal- Leorio- simple, tempermental, caring- Kurapika- cool, graceful, smart, analitical, loyal.    The show closely follows the manga and is supposed to go well past the original. If you are like me and have watched the original, and are skeptical about this re done version, please watch it! Even knowing what was going on, i instantly got absorbed. If you have not watched the original, I encourage you to do so. One of my favorite things is comparing the two. It makes the great things about each version more obvious.   Let Gon's journey to becoming a legendary Hunter begin!",5
hunter-x-hunter,"*Spoiler free review from someone who has no knowledge of the old series or manga*A lot of people when they watch the first episode will probably think this show is sort of silly, kiddish and be put off from watching it right from the start. I know I was.. Had it not been for the people giving it 5 stars I would have never considered pressing on. By episode 5 you should have at least seen enough to be able to make a semi-clear decision on whether this anime is good or not for you. But in my opinion that wouldn't be doing justice for what this show deserves. As of now I am on episode 41 and had just watched episode 1 five days ago. The episodes get super intense and are often always very entertaining. It's been too good for me to take a break from watching. It would be a shame for anyone to pass this up especially if you only watched the first episode. Keep watching and I'm sure most of you who denied it will be easily won over",5
hunter-x-hunter,"This was my favourite anime when growing up, on par with Dragonball. It is one of those animes that you know helped spawnother action, fighting, fantasy and 'powers' in Anime. Nen, was a great instrument to the series and the different variations of it, we can already see this as 'Reiatsu in Bleach', 'Chakra in Naruto' etc. Remember that Hunter X Hunter was before these! The manga was great, but the original did have many fillers in it and some variations were changed that were not in the manga; but this remake is following the original story line which excites me for a few reasons which I will list below.As some of us know, the author suffered from some ailments and stopped the manga near the end of the 'Ant Arc' and the quality was diminishing. The anime also stopped at the end of 'Greed Island' where Gon and Killua were showing that they may have what it takes to rival that of the spiders and other top hunters. I am very happy that this series was picked up, by the original author and the manga was continued in a good quality to a good extent.Also, because the new anime is far behind the manga, there is no need to have long filler arcs which can irritate some people (we all know how Naruto had WHOLE SERIES of fillers which was irritating at times) and it is sticking to the original manga, to the point where the moves, specific frames and even words are being re-used. A great example of this could be seen in the 'Gon Vs Hisoka fight in Celestial Tower', where the new anime follows the manga 'word for word' and 'move for move', where the origianal anime did not, I could use the 'schwing and speech' before they fight as an example of this. Overall this is very promising and with the 'Ant Arc' finished in the Manga, and from the looks of it with another hiauts, another arc is still to come which is could see this new Anime last at least another 4 seasons if not more. This also gives the Author time to let the new Anime catch up to the Manga and not let the new Manga slip in quality.In a world where people shelve television shows on ""cliff-hangers-never-to-be-seen-again"" (which is a huge dissapointment) we can rest assured that this terrific anime has not fallen into this trend and that the author truly wants to finish this in fine form and give his fans the quality that this story has to offer. I highly recommend any anime fan to watch and support this series, if you loved the manga (which was one of Japans best sellers for many, many years) then you will love this anime; no questions asked!",5
hunter-x-hunter,"My friend nagged me for a couple months to watch HxH, and I kept putting it off... Don't do that!!This show is action packed, humorous, and every arc will keep you interested! The characters are diverse and interesting. The plot lines are good and the character development keeps you hooked. Great variety of characters, character skills are original and intriguing. Artwork is fantastic! You won't want to stop watching once you've started!",5
hunter-x-hunter,"Hunter X Hunter is an all around great anime!  It has great action, character development, and it is downright hilarious!  The pacing of this show is perfect and for being a longer series, none of the episodes felt very repetitive. For a long anime, I felt like none of the characters were really forgotten!  They kept popping back up with some sort of development or purpose,  it never felt like they were brought up just to bring back up, it felt like they had a purpose for being brought back. The character development does not feel forced either, the show never makes the viewer feel like they just got a new skill of of the sudden and its going to beat the enemy, it instead shows the viewer that the character has gotten stronger through hard work and perseverance.  The character designs are also very unique to each other and to other animes- the art is fantastic as reflected by the design of the characters.The humor of this show is perfectly melded with the hardcore action and dramatic/traumatic scenes, Hunter x Hunter has a balance like no other!  Each episode has at lease a little of both so the episodes never feel like they are being ruled by one genre.  In addition, the pacing is near perfect!  The series followers the boys over a super long period of time (over a year) and while the pace of time-space is uneven at some points, the pace of the episodes is not.  For example, the Chimera Ants final battle takes over 20 episodes to cover, yet the action is varied and each episode shows a new aspect or viewpoint of the massive and complicated battle taking pace.  I think this great slowing down of the time-space allowed the overall pace of the show to not feel to fast or lacking/hole-y.  And the ending does not disappoint!  Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideWhen Gon finally reached and talked to his dad it was a truly sweet moment and a perfect way to tie up the series!A must watch for all anime fans! - Delaney",5
hunter-x-hunter,"I got into this show a little less than a month ago, but I would watch episodes whenever I could. When the show ended I was absolutely devastated and still am. Usually I lose interest in long animes about 80 episodes (cough cough Shugo Chara cough chough Fairy Tail) but Hunter x Hunter has kept me captivated the whole way through.  There have been times when I've burst into hysteric laughter, been entranced into a battle scene, and couldn't stop crying over what I just watched. Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideThe chimera ant arc has your feels on rampage. The characters are all unique, I enjoyed their individuality. Words cannot express my love for the first ED. All in all, its just a roller coaster of emotions I would ride again. I would recommend this series to just about anyone.",5
hunter-x-hunter,"This is actually the first anime series I've watched. As a life-long (yea, I'm old!) TV addict, starting with the CLASSIC cartoons (Bugs, Daffy, cartoon violence, etc.) when I was 4-5 years old, and as a person who seldom writes reviews, I found myself addicted to Hunter x Hunter as soon as the Hunter Exam started. I ran 135 episodes in less than 2 months. I had to find resolution spots in and / or after each story arc to get my heart rate down! I could write a long essay on character and plot development,the various relationships between characters, the hero's journey, etc. But if you've seen the show, you don't need my input. If you haven't, then watch the show!! If you can handle the violence in context (it's a cartoon!), you'll dig it. The only problem is the series ENDS! Please write to the author and tell him to extend the story!!!",5
hunter-x-hunter,"I think that Hunter x Hunter is the best series that CrunchyRoll has to offer. It has its amazing story, loveable characters, and just the right amount of feel inducing moments to make you want more. I was hooked after the first couple episodes, and for a while Hunter x Hunter made me a shut-in until I was caught up. Well, not like it's any different than how I was or am now. Sadly, there is only one episode left at this moment, and I really wish there was more. But, Hunter x Hunter will always remain in my Top 5 anime of all time. As a person who is a fan of all genres of anime, I highly recommend it to anybody.",5
hunter-x-hunter,"I have been following this anime for more than 5 years beginning with the original 1999 anime, and the remake, which follows the manga more closely, is just as amazing. Hunter x hunter is shounen, but it doesn't focus itself with the overused elements we usually get in this genre about one kid who continuously gets more power, wins every fight, and also has to fight a villain to conclude the story. This anime is more realistic, in such that it's not about good vs evil, everybody can be bad as others can also be the hero. The anime is also very complex and every characters are well-developed. Anyone with an open-mind will definitely love it.",5
hunter-x-hunter,"I am a huge fan of anime and after finishing Naruto Ship.. and Fairy Tail episodes from beginning to most current I needed an anime fix!  I chose a couple I won't name and wasn't interested but then I found Hunter x Hunter.  I was instantly hooked as this show has so much to offer.  Character depth is very important and this show is overflowing with it.  Fans of the world of magic, such as Fairy Tail would find themselves diving straight in to this epic adventure.  The innocent aura of the main character Gon and ""most"" of his pals is equally matched by the horrific darkness surrounding many of the shows villains.  The plot twists and turns elegantly as you follow the characters on their journey.  If you are a fan of action this show hardly lets up accept only when neccesary so the well thought out story may unfold at a most pleasant rate.",5
hunter-x-hunter,"So you may be wondering why you should watch this anime , and also wonder how does this show gets its hype because looking at the cover photo of this show it may look like a stupid kiddy looking anime , but really its an amazing show that not only makes you want more , but keeps you satisfied throughout pretty much the entire thing . In this show characters change , scenarios change , it isn't like other anime where 300 episodes go by and everything is the exact same. This is a role model to other anime and since it is actually a remake , unlike other remakes they actually fix mistakes made in the previous show , exempt this show continues to follow the manga and is still running. Overall this anime is one of the absolute greatest and nails almost anythingThis series is more than a shounen , it is THE  Shounen  to watch",5
hunter-x-hunter,"My all-time favorite series...once you get past the first 2 episodes, you're gonna be hooked. There's barely any series out there that features actual children as protagonists, and this is one of them. And it does it SO WELL. So enjoyable and all the characters are fun to root for, even the evil guys.For those comparing HxH to Naruto or Bleach, please, this manga started BEFORE any of those; so if you notice any similarities, it's not that HxH copied them, but the other way around.Enjoy!",5
hunter-x-hunter,"If you (like myself) thought this shounen anime was strictly for the 12+ age group, then be prepared to rethink that assumption!Awww, just look at the cute & simple looking characters on the cover art....It does begin that way, but progressively builds into something more and more intense, don't get me wrong, its not ALL about fighting, violence, blood, loss, and forboding, it has an uncanny depth of real and relatable emotion.Do yourself a solid and pick this one up!",5
hunter-x-hunter,"I have been using Crunchy Roll for a long time and I never bothered to watch this anime, until a week ago i decided to take a chance on this anime and let me tell you it did not disappoint. This anime is not just a little kids anime but a unexpected adventure for all ages. I know the image looks innocent and cute, but let me tell you is not that ""cute"".Take a chance on this anime, you wont be disappointed.",5
hunter-x-hunter,"Possibly the BEST anime series I've ever seen. And I've seen a lot. From start to where it's at now I've found myself glued to watching it even up to the point where I re watch episodes. Kinda obsessive I know. But you know when there's a new tv series like the vampire diaries or something and you hear everyone addictive to watching it and all obsessive over characters. Well that's me with hunter x hunter. I was gutted the old series got cancelled but then was beyond happy it started again. There are moments where I find the narrator speaks too much but without the narrator the audience would be entirely clueless. The beginning is a little cringy and at times Gon and Killias friendship appears strange but you see the brotherhood between them eventually, otherwise can't flaw it! just wish that more episodes were released and a lot quicker than having to wait!",5
hunter-x-hunter,"Trust me guys this is the anime that you want to see. The last episode was just Amazing and i cant stress enough how much I want to see the next. It is so awesome that it even trumps naruto shippuden and many other animes. This anime has a good story and had movie like animation. By the way the characters have some story very similar to Naruto and I just want to point out the the origins of Hunter x Hunter were released before Naruto so don't assume this copied Naruto because in actuality Naruto Copied This show. Any way Like all great animes like DragonBall Z, One Piece, Naruto, and Fairy Tail, the anime starts of somewhat slow and Childish. For this show it starts of more childish than it does slow. (The pacing of this anime is absolutely perfect, there will never be a time where you want it to be faster or slower trust me). If you continue to watch this show it will increasingly mature in content with gore and dark story at a pretty quick rate. The depth is literally really deep and it can only be appreciated by adults because seriously a child actually wouldn't know how truly perfect the story of this anime is because it requires you to somewhat think about it because it really is that deep of a story. I am asking you guys to at least watch till episode 30 then decide to continue watching.(AND YOU WILL)",5
hunter-x-hunter,"I was so excited when I heard that they were continuing this anime series. I have fond memories watching HxH from when I was 8-9 years old 12-13 years ago. I loved it then and I love it even more now (at 21 years of age). I can't give a detailed analysis of it, but all I know is that after I watch an episode each week, I can hardly wait for the next one. You'll fall in love with all the characters- all so complex and the plot is well-written. It's just EPIC.Highly recommended!",5
hunter-x-hunter,"I've not seen the original but this is one of the few anime's that have inspired me to read the manga and I can honestly say i feel that it is an improvement, filler notwithstanding. However my favourite thing about this is the simple fact that it is what I like to call: ""Dark Shonen"": it has all the action heavy scenes; morally pure protagonists; arcs which don't seem to move the characters any closer to their goals that all major Shonen anime do, but it doesn't make me want to stop watching with just how pointless and childish most shonen seem. It doesn't gloss over the death that should occur around these life and death battles and this does affect Gon's view of the world over time. My favourite anime and beyond compare.",5
hunter-x-hunter,"A GREAT anime in ALL aspects! The action is fast paced and exciting, the story is thrilling and moving, the animation is seamless and proportionally eloquent, the growth of the characters are evenly discovered and built upon, all in all this has become one of my favorite shows. I started watching the original series but the version I had found was dubbed and I couldn’t stand the characters voices. This show keeps me excited for the next episode. I’ve not found many other animes that can keep 90% of the episodes entertaining. With the main plots keeping this series rolling I’ve found that even with what little fillers, if any, stay in line with the original plot and does not seem to bore me in the least. Hope you give this show a watch and stick with it. It truly does become a great show if you can stick through anything you do not seem interested in at w/e point.",5
hunter-x-hunter,"I'm currently watching the older version as well, and WOW I'm impressed with this anime. It's funny, cute, and has excellent fighting scenes. It always keeps me on the edge of my seat waiting to see what happens next! This definitely wasn't a waste of my time. I just can't help but love all of the characters (especially Killua, but you know, back to the main point). I would recommend this to anyone who loves anime c:",5
hunter-x-hunter,"I'm a huge fan of the original Hunter X Hunter series (including the OVA's), and have been waiting a long time for the show to be continued, although a little annoyed that it had to start again from the start rather than being a continuation, there was no way around that.The first 20 or so episodes had me quite skeptical considering that quite a lot had been cut out and yet nothing really had been added. However one of the first things I noticed was that I much preferred the new voice actress who plays the character ""Kurapika"", Miyuki Sawashiro (Whose voice-acting ability has reached God Level), lolWhilst I don't particularly care for updated visuals I do find the art new style works well for most of the story. As for the soundtrack, I think whilst the original show had some really nice tunes, the new soundtrack is much more enjoyable and epic (especially the use of choir in the more recent episodes).It wasn't long before this show got me completely pumped up and then I suddenly realized this is probably one of my favorite shows of all time, or at least somewhere in my top 5. At this point there is no doubt in saying it's the one thing I love looking forward to every week :DThis show does have many of the common themes (or maybe ""overused"") themes found in most typical ""fighting"" shows, such as the theme of ""getting beaten, training to get stronger, etc..etc.. (you know the drill)"" but it does it in a way that makes me feel more engaged and less annoyed then other popular shows like Naruto or Bleach. I think, the themes that this show touches on are handled in such a more genuine and human way that makes me feel like the characters are real (if it weren't for their ridiculously over-the-top inhuman strength).I have incredibly high expectations for this show and just can't friggen wait for the Chimera Ant Arc!!!",5
hunter-x-hunter,I have heard of this series but never before have seen the original anime nor have read the manga. I wasn't too excited at first but I am very happy I stuck with it! The characters are ones you soon start to know and the story is so fascinating and seems like it could go on forever. Because of all of this I decided to start purchasing the manga! This is definitively one of the better shows that I've seen!,5
hunter-x-hunter,"I think their doing an okay job with the remake so far. Its really good for the most part, however I hate how they cut out so much stuff. I was upset when they cut out the scene with Gon and Kaito, I mean it just did a better job of explaining why Gon wants to become a Hunter like his dad. I like all the action in the remake but then I stop and think about the orginal and how much I enjoyed the little side tracked moments that were always for the most part amusing. I will say though that I miss Hisoka's old voice actor, the new guy is good but he's just missing a whimsical quality to him. But then again watching the musical might have made me baised, I mean Hisoka's voice was brillant. My only other compliant was the fact that they skipped the Sushi test of the secound phase. This is supposed to be following the manga more closely but they deviated from it a lot more than the orginal anime. But overall I can't wait for more episodes to come out. If anything hopefully this new series will introduce more people to HunterxHunter and spread the HunterxHunter love =)",5
hunter-x-hunter,"Hunter X Hunter starts off alright.  For most of the first arc, it seems like this well-executed but somewhat generic shonen, one of many.  Little do you realize that this is just the author lulling you into a false sense of security, before yanking you down a twisting, unpredictable, intellectual rabbit hole full of interesting, realistic characters and intense, incredibly variable fights.Regarding interesting characters, HxH has some of the best villains out of any show I've seen.  This isn't just because they're powerful, though they are that.  It's also because they feel like real people.  They have motives, they have friendships, they have likeable quirks, they learn and grow and adapt and become stronger.  In fact, calling them a ""villain"" is really a disservice to the show, they should be called ""antagonists"".  Their position isn't based on some cartoony trope like evil for evil's sake, or power, or most of the typical motives.  It's because they have different values, different perspectives, and that causes them to clash with the main characters and society as a whole.Regarding fights, pretty much every fight in HxH is unique and intense for its own reasons.  There are many reasons for this, but one of the big ones is the power system.  No spoilers, but pretty much any fight can go any way: power levels are explicitly said to be completely irrelevant.  This is because the abilities that the power system allows are incredibly varied, from something as simple as enhanced strength to something as intricate as a bank that gradually charges interest on energy, to something as strange as a vacuum that can suck up any non-living matter.I could go on, but I wont.  Long story short, watch this show, and give it a chance past the first several episodes.  You won't be dissapointed.",5
hunter-x-hunter,"I'd only seen this through some gifsets around the internet, and just started watching because i liked Killua's design, and i'm so glad i did. I loved almost every minute of it, but the biggest draw was definitely the friendship between Killua and Gon. I feel like a lot of things miss out on the simplicity of a solid bond of love (not necessarily romantic),  but from their constant playfulness, training together (and each other), and throughout it all the love was there and its why this show will always be a favourite. The ant arc was really slow though... Luckily the arc after that was really good",5
hunter-x-hunter,"HxH 2011 is my favorite anime of all-time, and for many reasons too.- Favorite Arc of All-time- Gon and Killua are in my top 5 favorite characters of all-time- Best rage moment in all of anime IMO- Best fight of all-time IMO (Not gonna state due to spoilers)- Saddest moment in anime IMOIf you're a fan of Shonen or action/adventure in general give this a shot. It won't let you down.Greatness x Greatness.",5
hunter-x-hunter,"This is a remake of my favorite anime and I've been a fan for almost 2 decades now. The most notable difference this anime has compared to others within its genre is variety. No 2 arcs ever feel the same, nor do they inject themselves with the cliche's found in most other series. ""The more you see, the less you know for sure"" is the case with this series, each arc displaying very diverse themes and tones that range from light to incredibly dark. The majority of the characters are 3 dimensional, having intriguing backgrounds and complex personalities. My favorite character above all else is most definitely KILLUA, but the rest of the cast are great as well. The sound and music was great for the most part. The voices for all the characters were great and fit perfectly as well as their performance, Gon and Killua's actresses especially. The music, while great, felt misused sometimes. There were moments when certain songs were placed that defied the intended mood. The OP never really changes,and while I prefer the original OP, this one's okay. I loved all the EDs, especially the first one.The art style is a breath of fresh air compared to the original. The original art style was much darker while the art style in this series was lighter which also reflected upon the designs of the characters. I for one loved this change considering the focus is mainly on the 2 lead characters : Gon and Killua <3 and the art style heavily complimented the largest aspect of the series, the beautiful friendship between the 2 of them.5/5",5
hunter-x-hunter,"*SIGH* I should be doing homework right now but instead I decided to write a review of this amazing anime!You might think at first, ""Looks like a nice, typical adventure/shounen anime!"" It's not. Yes it is a shounen. Yes it is an adventure anime. But it is in no way a typical one.The story of Hunter x Hunter is a complex one. The main characters train hard using their powers called ""Nen"", they build long lasting friendships, they go through many hardships, but it never ends like you think it would. The main character doesn't suddenly get a powerup when he is losing. The main character doesn't win solely by the power of friendship. And the main character doesn't even face the main villain in the end himself. Sometimes,  nobody wins. The line between good and evil is blurred. It isn't always something simple as ""This is the bad guy. He must lose."" You question your ideals. You question your motivation. Is it truly good? Is the main character truly the hero? Of course, the story isn't always so deep. It certainly doesn't start as deep! It is full of silliness and laughter, filled with lovable characters and upbeat music. I promise you, you will  fall in love with this anime. The animation is beautiful, the music is incomparable to others, and the variety of characters is surprising. You will not get bored.So do yourself a big favor and watch this! You won't regret it. I don't know a single person who has!",5
hunter-x-hunter,"Title says it all really. This show is amazing, all the main characters and a lot of the side characters are really interesting and have cool stories tied to them which makes them very memorable. The ability system is extremely well thought out. Above all else I think my favorite thing about this show is Gon and Killua's friendship, it is great seeing how much those two interact and play off of each other in each episode. It so good that if there were no action packed amazing fight scene (and there are) I would still watch the show if it was just about Gon and Killua running around the country having fun.",5
hunter-x-hunter,"Although you may not understand what you're delving into with the first arch of Hunter x Hunter, it gradually grows into more mature content, and only heads upwards from there, this show does not provide any sort of ""break"" episodes to hype you for the upcoming suspense, it pushes the roller coaster further and further uphill and I have yet to see a point where the action is put aside and something else is put into focus.The characters in this show are very deep and well-designed, there isn't the whole approach of ""this is the bad guy, here's why he's bad, start disliking him"" even the most wanted criminals have a deep history explaining why they are that way.The voice acting is top tier, with great integration into the characters (no one voice stands out as immersion-breaking) they all sound professional and express the mood very well.Animations are high end as well, surprisingly so, since there's a lot of fast pace combat scenes and wonderful displays of color throughout the show.In short: Watch this! It does what it aims to do so well it's a masterpiece.",5
hunter-x-hunter,"I've watched the 1999 version of Hunter x Hunter in Arabic for the majority of my childhood..since the channel kept repeating it over and over again BUT it was worth it! I never got sick of it and then watched countless times in Japanese as well.This version is much more enjoyable because the drawing is obviously better and clearer and they actually went beyond where they stopped in the old version.It's a hugely under-rated anime that at first glance looks like an innocent adventurous kids show, until you get to know the characters and their background..then sh*t gets real!As the show goes on, you would not believe how carefree the characters were and how they developed, especially after the hunter's exam.",5
hunter-x-hunter,"this show is amazing and it hooks you after just a few episodes. This show is very addictive and once you start you are not going to want to stop until you are caught up. One of the great things about this show is the supporting characters, the supporting characters in this show are so strong that if there was a separate series of each i could easily watch and enjoy it. Finally i think the visuals in this show are about as high a weekly released anime can be, they are so beautiful and make you think that you are watching a anime movie each time. In summary this is a great show and i recommend it to anyone trying to get into a 100 + episode series.",5
hunter-x-hunter,"This is one of the greatest story lines not just in anime terms, just in general. I honestly can say this is my favorite show of all time. The soundtrack and themes are so appropriate  and spot on. The character development is out of the world and I love the fact it doesn't make the enemy's mindless fools. It actually gives you an insight to their views and beliefs and makes you sympathize rather than just making you hate them and want the good guy to beat them. Its complicated at times and despite its looks it is most definitely not a kids show. This is very mature material and has a lot of life lessons and thing you can relate too. Fully recommend this show!",5
hunter-x-hunter,"This is my first and only review I will ever write. This show deserves an Oscar, Nobel prize, an emmy and every god damn award on planet earth. If I haven't made it clear, I love this show. The first couple of episodes might be hard to get into but give it time and it'll win you over. There are moments that are too good that rivals GoT, TWD and every other huge succesful show.It's everything you ever needed. It has comedy, drama, action and some very heartwarming moments. It is NOT a kids show. If you like Attack On Titans or Naruto then this will be your cup of tea. I love Naruto but it pales in comparison with Hunter X Hunter, it has more pace and is so much more mature. Please watch this.",5
hunter-x-hunter,"This show is fantastic, it has many awesome characters and great stories to go along with them. The show reminds me alot of Naruto but this came out before Naruto originally so they did NOT copy it. So far this show has kept me watching more ending almost every episode with a ""What the hells gonna happen next?"" feeling. Also don't let the bright colors and kid protagonist fool you this show is actually really dark at times, which I like. I'm glad they brought this back never seen the original but if its anything like the remake its one hell of a show.",5
radiant,"The anime is... cute. The protagonist was a little stupid but he was also a super nice kid. Had that, ""Altruistic hero that never gives up!"" vibe going for him. I've seen it before. It didn't give me anything new but hey, I'm here to watch a Shonen anime. I don't have especially high standards when it comes to a series meant for kids. The world is fun the characters are quirky and the plot is simple enough where I can be brain dead and follow along without exerting much effort. It's meh but a good way to pass time. Then I read the manga. Now I won't watch the anime ever again. It's not an honest adaptation whatsoever. Anime and Manga Seth are NOTHING ALIKE. Yes, they have the same character design and the animation IS itself really good... but manga Seth doesn't smile THAT much. He's actually angry a lot, justifiably so. His motives and pain feels more real to me than anime Seth, who felt more like a ""main character"" fill in for a new anime series. As of me writing this, the anime is at it's ninth episode and the manga at it's seventeenth chapter. That is NOT enough space between productions to start an anime and it shows. What I thought was just bland writing was actually FILLER. Black Clover was given ridiculous amounts of hate for their few episodes of filler and the Radiant anime has sooooo much more. Spoilers. Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideChapter six in the manga has our lovable cast all the way over at Rumble Town. Which then follows an amazing, gripping plot that is extremely dark and heartfelt. I was blown away. It deals with heavy-hitting themes like xenophobia, racism, weaponizing and enslaving children. There were also references toward the Salem Witch Trials and The Inquisition. So yeah. I read all seventeen chapters in one sitting and was so devastated with how the beginning of this anime BUTCHERED the beginning of the manga that I refuse to watch anymore of the anime. Episode NINE of the anime finally has Rumble Town REVEALED at least, though they have not yet gone there. Instead the ninth episode was entirely filler to develop Dragunov. Which really doesn't match how Dragunov is portrayed in the manga. I'm assuming of course that he's going to have a character change just like Seth did to make him more generic. Because that's what the anime characters are all written as. Extremely generic tropes meant to draw in viewers. And hey, I'm actually okay with that. You know your audience and you cater to them. Good for you. BUT... the manga is SO MUCH BETTER. Knowing now how amazing, deep, dark, and COMPLEX the manga plot is (after only 17 chapters!), I'm just appalled at how the anime has treated the original work of the author. I could literally go on for pages about the differences but I'm pretty sure there's some sort of limit here. I'll summarize it with this - The anime is painfully ""okay"" to watch. If I didn't know about the manga I'd still be watching it every few weeks when I had a lot of extra free time with nothing else better to do. It's fun. It can get too quirky to the point of not making sense (I'm looking at YOU coffee-loving Octosquid) but it's not bad at all. Just meh. The animation is actually really good and all of the colors are super bright and pretty to look at. Especially with far away shots of landscapes. But the manga... Oh, I've been wanting to get into a new manga for a long time and THIS is it. This is one of my new favorite manga series for a long time. Seth is just so complex and dynamic as a character that I never want to see anime Seth ever again. I feel like the anime took the manga put a ""happy"" filter over it. The manga isn't happy. It has it's moments, of course. Seth is hilarious. There are so many mature and witty gags that I could read this manga forever. The anime is like the ""kid friendly"" version of the manga and gave me bad memories of 4kids back in my childhood. Yeah. I'm making THAT comparison.",3.5
radiant,"No reason to go on and on about this one. Putting it simply; it is a complete bastardization of the manga and is absolutely not worth anyone's time. Read the manga for the good version of this story and of these characters.The anime tells the story poorly; it is mostly filler BS that just makes things drag on entirely more mundanely and boringly than the manga by leaps and bounds. The characters aren't accurate in many cases to the manga versions of them, and arguably the manga's proper versions of their personalities and actions are far more entertaining, engaging, and/or interesting.",1
radiant,"I was a bit excited about this show based on how it started. There's a world with magic, but those who are able to use are seen as monsters, for they survived and encounter with humanity's main nemesis. The protagonist has a very clearly defined goal: to find Radiant, the place where these odd creatures come from, in order to destroy it and prevent nemesis from invading and destroying humankind.Even after seeing first-hand how normal humans mistreat Seth (the protagonist) and Alba (his mentor and mother-figure), we get an even more heart-wrenching moment on the third episode in Alba's flashback as we see young Seth being beaten and almost killed by humans who saw him as a monster simply because he has horns and can do magic. That episode really made me feel for these characters, and it was impressing that Seth was a good person who, despite all that he has suffered at the hands of normal people, still wants to protect them.By contrast, we see in the second episode that there are magicians who do not have the same outlook as Seth and Alba, and who want to take advantage on normal humans, as well as seek revenge. That duality really made the world of Radiant more relatable and interesting.Alas, that is where it all stopped. After the third episode the show took a deep dive into nonsense. Seth meets members of the Inquisition, who appear to be the antagonists who pursue and seek to eliminate sorcerers. ""Why?"" you ask. The so far (episode 6) the show's answer is ""just because."" There isn't a concrete reason for the Inquisition to hunt down sorcerers indiscriminately. It would make sense if they only went after wrong-doers. However, they arrest the naive Seth who could not control his broom and ""crashed"" into the Inquisition's ship. They had arrested Melie (the red-haired witch) because she did not have her documents with her. And I believe they were going to arrest Doc because he was carrying the remainders of a Nemesis.In the first couple of episodes the show clearly sets that sorcerers are the only ones who fight the Nemesis. Not once did the show state that the Inquisition does likewise, only that it is out to get sorcerers for no reason. That is simply not a good way of building up the world. Having a villain with no real motive is boring. Sure, the Nemesis are monsters that destroy everything in their way, but, so far, they seem to be mindless creatures. The Inquisition, however, only seems to be out to get all sorcerers, despite the fact that they are the only ones able to protect humanity from the Nemesis.Also, from the fourth episode forward everyone becomes incredibly one-dimensional and over-the-top idiotic. Those in the Inquisition boat seem incompetent of handling two young magicians and a goofy human. Then they arrive at the flying wizard mecca of Artemis Academy, which Doc forces Seth to become a citizen, knowing fully-well that that will cause Seth to be in enormous debt, which will be transferred to Doc as he had already gone through that process with Melie. Sure, it was very interesting when the cat leader of Artemis brought out the city's defense against the Inquisition, but that's about it. Everything in that town is incredibly goofy for its own sake. Melie, Seth, and Doc all become extravagantly wacky, boisterous, and unbearable to watch.At the end of episode six, Yaga, whom Alma sent Seth to encounter, decides to take Seth as a pupil, for we know that he is special. It seems like the show may or may not get better, but so far it has been incredibly disappointing, especially after such a great set up.TL;DR first three-episodes gave hope of a good series, but the show ultimately falls flat on one-dimensional characters and over-the-top tropes",2
radiant,"This review is after watching ALL of season 1. I wouldn't say this anime is a 10/10 show, especially since the start felt too much like a basic shonen. But... a little further along, it starts to grow on me. I thought it was just going to be one of those 'oh he's op, gonna beat every baddy with the power of desire/motivation blah blah blah' kind of shows... but stuff actually happens and there are actual feels further on in the season/it's not quite so simple. I'm glad I kept up with this show instead of dropping it like originally intended. (btw, notice how like 90% of the people giving the show less than 3 stars are saying the manga is better?.... the show standing alone is decent though.) 'Bout to go read the manga though cuz of those reviews...",3
radiant,"Well first of i was a little skeptical about this and the first few episodes i was starting to give up on the anime but if you grin the first few episodes the anime actually is very much enjoyable the story at first was a bit dragging on my opinion. The main character is funny and he has a very interesting background lots of mysteries about his past, the anime it self is funny and the more episodes you go through the anime is beginning to go even more interesting, the animation is very good and the soundtracks aswell and the story line is super interesting and exicting cant wait to see this animes full potential when people become to realize how good this anime actually is, the anime is like mixing One Piece and Fairy Tail. I very much enjoy this anime and highly reccomend it to anybody else.",4
radiant,"I feel that a lot of people go into rating anime with the wrong expectations, to begin with. You should understand what the anime is meant to be, and if that appealed to you but it failed your expectations, then rate it poorly.In the case of Radiant, I expected a Shonen based on a well-regarded manga, so I know that the story won't quite compare to the original (seriously, shows and movies based on books are seldom as good as the original story). With that said, I've thoroughly enjoyed radiant for what it is: a coming of age story. And for that, this is an excellent shonen anime",5
radiant,Haven't read the manga.Genuinely struggled through the first half of s1 as it got a bit too Sunday morning cartoony for me but it picks up and manages to develop some maturity. Animation is really nice and the main character develops some depth.Lots of mysterious aspects to the plot which leaves you hoping for more!!If you can make it through the mid part of s1 you're in for a good ride! Written after s2 ep4.Hope it helps!,5
radiant,"looks aside this anime is terrible and its a false telling of RADIANT in general the show makes character that where serious sound like fucking idiots and seth in portrayed as a child his voice sounds like that of a child where as in the manga seth is supposed to be a mid teen that has a goofy side of him but he is ultimately goal focused and rather serious, always pushing himself and wanting to do things on his own as much as he can. while in the anime they make it seem like hes hunting nemesis for fun but the also make him doubt himself. ep 2 where he asked the bravery quart for help? while in the manga he tells them to buzz of and that'd he handle it himself. they also had him running around scared of the nemesis which contradicts his personality of wanting to tackle everything head on. IDK when the first volume of this manga came out i was hooked instantly and have kept up to date ever since and when i saw this anime coming out i was so hopeful but not 15 seconds into the first ep things where already different and the useless addition of characters was a pathetic attempt at trying to put more emotion into the ultimate build up for the fight and to be honest i cant get through ep3 i forced myself to watch 1 and 2 and it was beyond corny and character personalities, traits, and voices where nothing like what i had pictured. the black clover adaptation is better than this. when you take something spin it around change everything that people loved about the original you get this a anime that's always going to kill the hopes and faith of the ones that where looking forward to it the most.",4
radiant,"I held off watching this for awhile because of all the negative reviews, and then saw it came out with a second season.  While I have seen a lot of bad shows inexplicably get a season 2, I decided to start watching this show.  The first few episodes got me into the idea of the show...then came a lull, and then holyyy cow did it get badass really really fast.  Give this show some time to warmup, if you are patient it ends up being worth it.  Is it a 10/10?  No, because there is definitely too much filler compared to story arc.  I am hoping the second season will remedy that though!!!",1
radiant,"RADIANT is actually an anime that could have a lot of promise, but seemingly from the first season it hasn't been treated too well. There are a lot of 'Flashback' segments in the early 'training' episodes which pretty well regurgitate content from the past few episodes you would have just watched. The character personas come off as too similar to past anime's (such as Naruto, Fairy Tail, or what not); beyond just being sort of annoying. Probably the worst thing though is that there doesn't feel like there is all that much content in each episode where Seth is in Artemis; in many ways it reminds me of the DBZ half hour of 'screaming' or 'attack being charged' feeling.Going into the second season though, it seems that the anime has improved substantially. It feels like there is actual content to watch here, and some character development has occurred that at least makes it different from other anime. I don't necessarily not recommend this but I do perhaps suggest holding off until it can be determined if season 2 and on makes this anime 'good'.",3
radiant,The anime definitely toned down the source material for a younger audience and even cut out key events that are instrumental to telling the story. It isn't terrible but the manga is quite good and this is mediocre at best. If you enjoyed this even a little do yourself a massive favor and read the manga it is well worth the time. If you hated this the manga still might appeal to you but if you just read the manga and are considering watching the anime just be warned this won't live up to the source material.,4
radiant,"First impression: I'd say that Radiant reminds me of Naruto, except, a little more grounded, perhaps. It is as you'd expect from a character, male, and in his young years and an extrovert attempting to learn magic and become the ultimate hero.More in depth: Personally, the story and ideas seem solid. The intro to the anime kept me interested and the arrange of character seemed interesting. The setting and the world seem well made and thought out; solid and firm. The characters on the other hand are wild and free, amazing details, and vibrant color palette, and an equally exuberant personalities, naturally.The story starts out typically; an quick summary of the world and how it works, switching to the main character running across rooftops, showing off his skills, and ending with a minor baddie showing up and ultimately failing to stop it, to which he is saved; their the first episodes ends.Conclusion: I'd say, this anime has grand potential. However, it keeps to the same introduction, typically male hero character and support groups, and all of it feels the same, just a different world, with different rules. The enemies seem to be the most interesting as little is told about them, they fly through the skies as eggs, and hatch, before causing chaos. Seems there's an arrange of different types of enemies, and if experience tells me anything, each type is going to have its own weakness and strength that the character will have to learn in order to defeat them!",3.5
radiant,"i originally thought this show was going to start out slow then ramp up, similar to how Black Clover began. OH BOY WAS I WRONG. i tried to watch it but it was so painfully average that i had to take breaks with this show, it felt like homework! I am giving it a 3 star rating however as it still had a good premise, but i'm really hoping they improve on the fatal flaws that really make this anime tasteless. It also gave me a hint of other good anime's. It was like there was an aftertaste of a great adventure starting and decent character development, but sadly that was all. This anime is heavily lacking in the good qualities that can really make shows magical.",3.5
radiant,"1 star has been added for not making the protagonist a screaming little boy early on (i'm looking at you Black Clover) 1 star has been added for having a unique take on where sorcerers come from.1 star has been added for having a possible Yandere love interest that will (most likely) become my next waifu.2 stars have been removed for not being all that original in terms of concept.Overall, Radiant could be the underdog this season. It has a lot of potential and I'm a sucker for protagonists with hidden/dormant powers, so hopefully as new episodes come out it'll turn out to be great. For now, it's average but worth keeping an eye on. Would recommend for anyone who enjoy investing early in potential anime hits.",4
radiant,"So far it is enjoyable to watch, but its not the greatest. I don't really care about the MC or any of the side characters, except for Alma. The animation is alright. The sound design is alright. Nothing all to special about this show. Like it would of been interesting to see him get convinced by the old white beard guy and sorta make the MC a anti-hero. But yeah nothing special or new, just another shonen for me to watch to pass the time.",3
radiant,"It's early yet, but it's clearly very similar to Fairy Tail and Black Clover containing elements of both. You have a goody two-shoes meathead protagonist, over the top bad ""normal"" people, and a whole host of things that are somewhat unpolished.That being said, it's not all bad. While the drawing isn't very complex (and it's quite over the top in character designs), it's still decent. The animation is also decent, and there are fights not only against other sorcerers but giant monsters.",3
radiant,"I love Mellie's enormous red hair and split personality.  She would do anything for her friends.  She seems like she gets lonely at times, but she always tries her best.  But Ocoho is so cool.  She rides a dracoon (the cutest portmanteau ever).  And she is written really well.  She's more in charge of her own destiny and often makes decisions that run against what she's supposed to do.  She could easily be the lead character or have her own spin-off.",5
radiant,"It starts out boring and generic, reminded me of Black Clover a little too. Season one is a little bit boring overall expect the last couple of episodes. Season 2 is where it's at. I can strongly say that season 2 is one of my favorite animes to watch this season. it starts out a little slow but the suspense is amazing. I couldn't predict what was going to happen. Don't look at the older reviews, it's only manga fans. As someone that never read the manga, I would definitely watch this anime again. It needs way more starts than it has, underrated anime.",3
radiant,I only watched 8 episodes and got bored. I just keeping waiting for something to happen but it just seem like all I'm getting are fillers to be honest. I was told that the manga is way better but I really don't like reading so here I am. It just feels like D. Gray man rip off but the main character are way more dense and stupid. For any of you guys that already watch the whole does the story picks up or is it this boring and annoying the rest of the way? Don't get me wrong this anime have a lot of potential but they are not doing anything with it.,3
radiant,"I Learned about Radiant through adds on crunchyroll well watching Demon Slayer and thought the add remined me of RWBY back when the show was good but it wasn't enough to get me to watch it. Later I was talking about RWBY, fullmetal and other shows with a friend and he recommended it. So I checked it out and yeah at first is stuck me as enjoyable but kinda dumb fun like Fairy Tail or Naruto. (I later learned this was mostly filler for anime only but to me it didn't really feel too fillery if you get my meaning) Anyway that feeling of a dumb fun lingered for awhile Until Rumble Town. Now I would recommend this show simply do to this Arc alone. You instantly got the feeling that something was off and wow the show got dark quick. at to not spoil anything I'll tell you this. If you like Rwby pre season 4? watch this, you like FMA brotherhood? Watch this. This steampunk fantasy is incredible and I bet it will only continue to get better in it's second season.",3
radiant,"It's entertaining. I see a lot of reviews that compare it to the manga. I didn't read the manga, and I don't think I should either. The thing is, one should judge a show on its own, regardless of the source material. I shouldn't be required to read the manga to judge it. That being said, the animation is spot on, and the plot entertaining. It isn't a masterpiece, nor does it pretend to be. So if you have some time to kill, I recommend a watch.",3
radiant,"I'm going to start this review off by saying that Radiant is possibly one of my favorite Shounens, not just in this last season, but of all time. The Protagonist is as simple and  cliche as they come but that doesn't detriment the rest of the show. The characters are a huge reason why this show is now one of my all time favorites. They all have a variety of different personalities that, on their own might not seem all that special, but when they interact with others or within their little group you feel like there's a special connection between all of them.I feel the need to mention that the animation is constantly average, save for one fight scene in the show that I won't spoil, which actually makes me love this show even more. It's not going to win any awards for animation like UFOtable (RIP) but it's far from the worst.I would have liked to see more of the ""main cast of villains"" which appear sparsely in some episodes lurking in the shadows and behind the scenes of our heroes' many adventures. One character in particular that I would like to focus on is the eye patch wearing inquisitor you see in the cover art for the show. When you watch the opening and he appears you quickly write him off as any other villain, but when you get more into the show you start realizing that this ""villain"" might not actually be that bad of a guy. You feel a sense of empathy for him at times especially during the later stages of the show. Without going into too much detail about the plot of the show he is definitely someone to keep your eye on.I don't want to make this review an entire essay that you would have to read just to know the basic premise of the show, so I'll keep the plot section short and sweet. The plot revolves around a sorcerer in training named Seth and his quest to defeat the hive mind of these monsters called Nemesis. The Nemesis are attracted to overflowing energy that Sorcerers use called Fantasia. Using Fantasia is the only way to stop the nemesis' so the sorcerers don't really have a choice. After realizing that these Nemesis' are never going to stop appearing Seth sets out on a journey to destroy their nest called Radiant. That's pretty much what the show is for the majority of this first season. There are some filler episodes in here but not enough to deter me from watching any further *cough Boruto *cough. In all seriousness Radiant is one of the few new Shounens I have actually taken a liking to with its incredible world and dynamic characters. I just hope they decide sometime in the future to make a season 2.",4
radiant,"This show is good. Interestingly enough, the writer of the manga is French - and if you think about it, there is plenty of European historical inspiration laced throughout the series. The character of ""Seth"" has been changed a little from the manga at least in the beginning, because in the manga he loathes competition and doesn't have as much of a Naruto-esque ""gotta be the best!"" attitude. Overall, if you enjoy shonen anime - I think Radiant is absolutely worth your time. It is much better than the more popular and somewhat similar show ""Black Clover"". While Black Clover is ultimately boiled down to yet ANOTHER ""kid who never gives up"" - Radiant has much deeper philosophical themes, some of which are pretty timely. The show has more of a sense of foreboding and the characters are more complicated. Definitely watch.",5
radiant,anime deals with discrimination but in a good way of as in everyone is egual and its really interesting after the first few episodes. I hope this anime grows more. the thing about writing a review is that you need to apparently need to be detailed and im not really into sharing too much for anyone that wants to read the reviews before watching. all i know is that i like this anime enough to write a small review on it.,3.5
radiant,"A pretty good series so far, at least it is in my opinion. All animes now are pretty much a mashup of previous shows with a slight twist here in there so the creators can ""make  it their own"". Nothing wrong with it either, pretty much everything that can be done in anime has been done. Numerous times. (If I see another d**n anime come out about being reincarnated in another world and the main hero is extremely OP I'm gonna start watching american cartoons again.).......I did abandon my satellite for all Netflix and Crunchyroll anime shows.",3.5
radiant,"Soo... you know how Black Clover was kind of bad at the beginning and became better overtime. Well this show is kind of the opposite in the sense that it's good at the beginning but got a bit mediocre after some episodes. But hey, (That's just a theory a gAmE... ok no) the series is just getting started so I won't judge it, it still has a long way to go, and on it's own the source material in the manga would make for some incredible, even iconic, moments in the anime. Who knows maybe it could be the next big thing.",5
radiant,"This is my personal view of this show, and as someone who is a shonen-trash lover, I can say as far as it goes, this is the best shonen show right now. Blackclover suffers from inconsistent animation and some boring characters. One piece suffers from intense filler and slow pacing, and Boruto is kinda a mess.Now, Radiant, I would say this anime is a delight to watch if you like shonen. It's animated nice, it has fun characters, and it is charming all to watch. While the plot and motivations can be iffy, I wouldn't say its overly distracting. TDLR; Its a fun anime with good animation, that does suffer a little from the generic shonen tropes. If you like those tropes, you'll like this anime.",2
radiant,There is nothing wrong with this anime.  The story line so far has been great.  I believe that people are taking the show out of contents.  Watch it yourself and make your own determinations.  I like it that the main character doesn't allow other people believes interfere with his own beliefs.  I like that he refuses to become the monster that he is believed to be.  He is paving his own path and taking the high road.  It will be interesting to see if he can stay strong and stay the course especially after this last show.,4
radiant,"Let me start off I haven't read the Manga and I am judging on the Anime alone. Just on animation alone this beats out Black Clover but for some reason Cough ""Deep Pockets"" why is that show even getting decent reviews from anyone, yay they made the protagonist stop screaming all the time, tell you what Radiant's protagonist is a trope as we all kind of expected but all yelling is needed when he does. The depth of the characters (probably pulling from the manga) but the expressions and the timing of the reactions (only can get that from the Anime)have great comedic and emotional significance, that makes the story flow and hey when they do a obligatory ""This is what we have been through the past 10 episodes"" it still has a story line comparing it to Naruto is out of line. Just give Radiant a honest look and it will surprise you.",4
radiant,"Some people apparently like stupid main chars, im not one of them.This guy is so thickheaded it ruined the entire show for me.Cant even get my self to finish or even get half way through this serie.So it might just be that i´ve reached a point where id like to see something new but I really dont get any feeling from these people, Can share in their joy, pain, laughs or trials. they just come off as abit shallow and stereotypical, where the writers didnt really care much.",5
radiant,"Okay, nothing too extraordinary about this anime. I think it would be good for kids and teens. I do like that not all the sorcerers are good and enemies are bad. Doc adds some comic relief but he's a bit annoying, just my opinion. I really like Melie though. She's my favorite character. The MC is okay. I like that he is one of those ""never give up"" kinda heroes and I appreciate that he has OP power but it isn't just automatically given to him. He has to work for it and tailor his skills to utilize them properly. I'm curious about the Nemesis and if we will learn more about the intentions behind them. I think I'm 12 episodes in and nothing sketchy or questionable for young kids here. I would like to see more going into character development and storyline. Right now it feels a little too superficial for me (as an adult, anyway). It could add some depth without taking away the lighthearted feel of the show.",5
radiant,"I'll be quick about it (NO SPOILERS):Just another generic shounen anime. Stupid protagonist who wants to change the world and has silly characters as nakama. Protagonist is weak, but has potential (some raw inner strength) and needs to be trained by some cool guy with a real hard training. Just the regular stuff.Thus far, this show doesn't have anything original nor catchy. CONCLUSION: Watch this show if you really, REALLY, love shounen shows (like me).Bonus: Kinda Naruto with magic.",3
radiant,"First off the animation is fantastic, first couple of minutes you can see the quality, and I am liking the story do far. It would be nice to get a anime like this but where the MC is smart and learns powerful moves as the story goes on instead of being an airhead and starting with a lot of power but oh well. I hope this anime lasts awhile, I can see myself watching this for long time if it continues.",5
radiant,"I love the immediate design of Radiant. From its art style to the characters, creatures and the world encompassing them. I've read the one star reviews and how they say this show is too slow, but that's because this series is 21 episodes long, so it has some leeway to take its time in telling its story (in fact S2 is coming with another 21 eps). This show immediately decides to present what kind of world Radiant is, one filled with discrimination. It was interesting to see such a heavy subject matter in a show that I thought was going to be lighthearted. If I had to say one thing about this show, it's that it has heart, you learn about Seth (main character) and the world he lives in and you sympathize with his situation. I want this review to be simple, so all I'll say is watch the first 3 episodes yourself and then form your opinion on the show. Personally I love it, I bought the manga too and I can't wait for more Radiant!",5
radiant,The first few episodes really hold a lot of potential. The fighting expecially with how big just the first fights are gives us a hint of some epic fights to come. The magic is interesting and the story has emotion. I think what will take this from a good to great is some good plot twists revolving around why the eggs are coming and if they are really a bad thing. All in all I cant wait for more.Update - Short of the first few episodes this has really starting falling off pretty hard as nothing even remotely exciting has happened.,5
radiant,"This anime has good potential, im getting a mix of fairy tail and one piece with a little bit of Saturday morning cartoons from this show and since I love both of those shows, im excited to see where this goes. So far is doesn't do anything that hasn't been done before, but it does it really well. I like the art style a lot I can't quite put my finger on it but something about it reminds me of megaman legends. The protagonist is a bit cookie cutter but they also do a good job making him seem more human. As im writing this only three episodes are out right now and the show hasn't quite gotten into full stride but it's getting there.In summary, if you are looking for something that completely redefined the genre then you should look somewhere else, but if you are like me and are looking for the shonen kick then only shows like one piece and fairy tail can satify then you've come to the right place. With a wonderful art style and a great first 3 episodes, this anime has started off strong and I can only see good things up ahead.",3.5
radiant,"Just by the first episode, I can tell this anime is going to be very generic, the power of friendship, believe in yourself. Here are some reasons why.1. Cows somehow have the ability to instantly find out where a massive boulder came from to chase MC. When the boulder flew a great distance. That tells me, anime will have lots of disbelief comedy to try and make things funny.2. MC has the angry stampeding cows chase him into the city. Why the city? Why not run some other direction? But nope he decides to endanger the entire town. Once the cows are tamed, he wonders why everyone is mad at him. Seriously? Another stupid bland MC who has no self-awareness? Instant skip.3. MC cares about people that treat him like a servant/parasite. The anime has not shown why he cares about those people when they treat him terribly. His attitude is ""I must save these people"" as they proceed to be ungrateful telling him to do his job when he owes them nothing. He cares about them just because ""Good Guy"".4. The monsters, look like a mix of a stuffed animal and a Hollow from bleach. This anime has no originality. Looks like a mix of fairy tail and black clover. 5. Bland MC, a copy and past with no original stand out personality. He is boring stale bread.6. The magic looks like someone spilled glitter everywhere and no one felt like cleaning it up.7. Personal grudge, he has only heard stores of these monsters. The thing hatches from an egg, doesn't destroy anything. But the MC first natural instinct is to attack the monster, which makes the monster defend himself and kick the MC's rear end. I get it of the author doesn't want to humanize the monsters, but at least have the MC be curious to see what the monster would do when first being born. To see if the monster, intentionally destroy buildings and kills people or if it does it for self-defense. These are things that make a story unique and interesting. Instead of brand shonen. 8. Just skip the anime, nothing special or original to see here.",3.5
radiant,"This review is for Episode ONE. My opinion can shift over the course of a show, please keep this in mind. (I hope you chose to watch this one)Part of me still wants to change this Star Rating to a 5, but I won't, not yet. This show is everything that Black Clover should have been. It is a somewhat generic seeming Shoenen, with a Naruto-esque protagonist and a complex system of magic. However, there are some key distinctions that I must highlight here as to why I'm really excited to watch more of this show.For starters, the animation and art are very enjoyable, not the best I've seen, but much better than a basic Shoenen normally has.Second, the main character does not appear to have some hidden power that makes him op, he is just a boy learning to be a Sorcerer.Last, but not least, this show is not Japanese. It is French, the anime is a Japanese adaptation of the French source material. And there already seem to be some slight tonal and physical character differences as it relates to gender and age relations, this might make this a good anime to introduce someone to the medium. And, I might be wrong about this one, this is written with just one episode out.Anyway, as a Shoenen fan, I loved it, it really does come from a source of love for the genre and I hope it will continue with the same quality in future episodes.",1
radiant,"I would first like to be by saying that this anime has amazing character designs and a beautiful style. The animation alone made this enjoyable for me to watch and I do not know if it is just my impression but i love the color palette. Now for the actual plot, I felt a little underwhelmed as I did not find anything to capture my attention too much. This anime seems to follow many of the same tropes as other shonen making it feel a little off brandish. But this is the first episode however so we must take time to allow it to grow into its own. I like the main characters voice acting despite initially finding it displeasing as I feel it fits his character. I would also like to say that despite these negatives I feel this will grow to be an amazing anime. This is of course completely subjective and not based off too much evidence. I felt however that the flashback left me with a sense that this could indeed grow to be an anime full of amazing scenes and heartwrenching moments.",5
radiant,"The anime starts very slow, for not to mention it stinks of the stereotypical shonen setting with a young below average smart kid who has an unrealistic goal. I originally watched it because I didn't have anything better to do, but then suddenly after a certain event in the series everything took a turn.The characters, the setting, the feeling.. They are masterfully crafted, I find myself unable to find words to describe it. So in a stereotypical shonen series, whenever something impactful to the story and character happens it's not brushed off like it usually is. Like ""Oh my mother died, well that's ok because I still have the power of friendship and my goal of becoming the [title of the strongest of their kind]!!"" that kind of trope is not here. And I love it. You'd be surprised how realistic the character development and progression feels. It's a vibrant world that the first few episodes just don't do justice for. But from the bottom of my heart I highly reccomend picking this series up, in anime form or in manga!It's absolutely 100% worth it!",4
radiant,So bad i wrote my first review. Watched until episode 10 which had too many flashbacks. It never got any better and felt like it slowed down a lost after 3 or 5 episodes with fillers and events that really meant nothing to the plot or growth just like gegege no kitaro. They didn't even show yaya training. Boring waste of time.  If You want grigimore's and magic you should Watch black clover like people suggest.,5
radiant,"I watched it a bit and it was tedious. The animation was good though. But long story short, I'd rather just watch Black Clover.This anime just felt like they took the basics of black clover, changed up the characters and then just decided to just call it a day. It might be because I've heard this exact story before (because as I said it's just a worse version of BC) so that might be why I find it boring.",4
radiant,"An excellent show that started off a bit slow after the initial arc, but has really hit its stride in the most recent episodes regarding Rumble City. Haven't read the manga, and for all of you ""but the manga was better"" folks, saying that repeatedly honestly makes me want to read it less, and it's probably the same with other folks too. You're just making yourselves look rather silly.As for the show, it starts off relatively light-hearted, and this is where most of the ""just another light-hearted shounen"" reviews are coming from. DO NOT LISTEN TO THEM. After the initial Sorcerer City arc (you'll know what I'm talking about when you get to it), the show starts to get much more nuanced and mature with the Rumble City arc. The other reviews, the ""it's just leftist Trump-hate hurdurdur"" ones... you guys realize that many shows talked about xenophobia, discrimination, and immigration well before Trump took power right? Those aren't new topics.",5
radiant,"...I just saw the poor rating, and decided to not leave it at that.This show, to me, is not bad at all. In fact, it is much fun to watch.The animation is well done; the characters are developing, so far, as does the story.The protagonist has a background which makes his actions credible; he aims high with a strong resolve; and meets companions - now, I am eager to see where the adventurous journey leads to!If you like adventurous anime, such as Black Clover, try this show. It surely is not the most perfectly epic series, which to my mind it does not proclaim to be - to me, it's mostly ""just"" entertaining and sometimes unexpectedly more than that; and most importantly, it has it's own vibe.Tune in and judge for yourself; worth a try, in my humble opinion.",5
radiant,"I tried. I tried because the art was pretty decent and the fight in the first few episodes looked like it may lead to something interesting. I just can't stomach it though. I had to stop half way through Episode 5 in an effort to save my dwindling supply of brain cells which had been culled since the first few moments I decided to try this once more. Maybe this gets good, but I highly doubt it. It is plagued by the worst writing and characters that I've ever witnessed. Why not 1 Star you ask? The art and animations are half way decent. I'll give it a second star because of that. Good bye, horrible anime. May we never meet again.",5
radiant,"Radiant has a slow start, the best episodes come after it has its third. The first three episodes are decidedly bad, and suffer from pacing and writing issues, but the fourth episode is a breath of freshness. Radiant takes that pace and builds on it for a few episodes.But Radiant doesn’t stop there. It shatters expectations once again in the ninth episode. The primary antagonists were given a good deal of depth, and were shown as real people. They weren't ready-bake-bad-guys, but bold men of action bent on saving the many at the cost of a few.All of the poor writing decisions were decidedly refined, the pacing issues outpaced, and Radiant went from being a two star trash heap into a five star shounen anime. Radiant is a lot like a shounen anime protagonist. It starts out weak, but keeps trying harder. Push it down and it gets back up, better than before.",3
radiant,"[Disclaimer: This review was written after watching only the first 3 episodes.]In the first 3 episodes, RADIANT is very similar to Hunter X Hunter. Think about it: a young boy emerges alone in a world of people. He wants to become a hunter. His mother, though at first sad at the news of his departure, learns to accept it and let him go if she truly cares.Now, I'm not saying its exactly the same. The mothers are drastically different, for one. But I do think RADIANT was at least partially inspired by HXH. Why is this not a bad thing? Because it grows off of HXH. From what I've seen, its already begun its course to become something completely different. Yes, it may start off similar, but I'm sure it'll branch off into its own unique, original thing if given time to. Certainly not a favorite of mine, but still a pretty solid anime nonetheless.",4
radiant,"Currently in episode 6 of the series and I enjoy it alot! I personally never watched Naruto or any other big fighting based anime with over a hundred episodes but other reviews point out similarities between them and this anime. Here are my main points:Plot :  Person A is a young boy that wants to achieve a impossible goal that many others have failed to do. Person A doesn't know his true parents as well, and sets off to achieve said goal. People criticise this anime for reusing the same plot as other shonen anime but you can't forget that there is no such thing as ""True Originality"" any more cause everything else has already been done before. It's about how you use that premise to your advantage and make something unique. Animation: The anime itself is quite pretty. I honestly love the colors and visuals and I find myself distracted by the magic being casted ( Ooooh pretty lights ) . I'm removing a star for the most part because in the beginning there was some graphical errors with it. One of the characters, Alma, has only one arm and the other one is cut off. They pointed this out around ep 3 or 4 that this happened a while ago and proving that they know of this (the company). Several scenes show her with both arms are intact and other scenes with the one arm gone. It became a game whenever she is screen to see if she had a missing arm or not.World Building: The concept of this anime is neat to say at the least. Wizards get their magic from being touched ( Bad touch ) by monsters and are outcasted by the towns. Ok, nice concept, but there is some missing info there like, why do they get cursed from the monsters? Open concepts like those are both good and bad for narratives but it doesn't mean that ""magic"" should be the answer for everything. Why is that man a cat? Magic. Why is that man a puppet? Magic. What decides the type of curse people get and how does it relate to being able to control magic? Stop asking stupid questions.Characters: Everyone is a form of a cookie cutter shonen character. Main character that is hyperactive and wants to achieve his dreams. Female supporting character and possible future love interest. Smart(Maybe) pilot that always seems to be the butt of the joke and his forced into the shenanigans of the protag whether he wants to or not. But like I said before, it's how you use that premise and how you spin it. All of the characters have some of their own small unique quirks that helps them differ from other anime (Except the protag. The cookie cutter was not as lenient for him as the others).End Statement:  I'd definitely recommend this if you are waiting for My Hero and love shonen type anime. The visuals are really nice but nothing to build a shrine for like No Game No Life. I'd probably watched this all the way through if the entire series was released if it wasn't simulcast.",3.5
radiant,"It's refreshing to see a world where magic itself has an external societal cost. The idea of cursed power gives sorcerers an ever-present obstacle.The way the villagers see it, the curse associated with surviving a nemesis attack is negatively affects the village as well. Sorcerers become an easy scapegoat for their problems.I think this series is headed in the right direction and I'm enjoying it so far.Edit: After the next couple of episodes didn't do the best with enhancing the plot I've dropped the show and changed my review to a 3.",3.5
radiant,"Let me start by saying that the first couple of episodes of this series are suuuuuper boring. But after that, it actually does start picking up. The story is a pretty typical, but it's not bad. I like the characters well enough, and it has some nice animation. A lot of the reviews I've noticed compare it to Black Clover, and while I haven't seen more than the first 5 minutes of Black Clover on account of the whole ear murder thing, if that's true then maybe I'll be inclined to give it another shot.",5
radiant,"...and I really don't get the complaints. The voice aint disturbing, if you feel that you are both ignorant of the obvious fact the the MC is voiced by a female and are really just looking for stuff to complain about that's not really relevant. You want annoying voice? Try Black Clover until he stopped screaming every 2 minutes...I have watched 3 episodes and find  the show entertaining so far. The feels that hit in the third was genuine and I look forward to see how it goes.Don't listen to the negative comments, watch for yourselves.",5
radiant,"Simply, it's a good show in a overstated market. It has a bit of it's own style, where it's clearly a high fantasy, but dose not beat you over the head with it. It also has an interesting conflict that it shows and explains enough to get the point across, but without being gratuitous with it. Lastly the main charter is a solid young dumb teen boy with a goal of being a ""Nemesis"" Hunter... and that's where the big problem begins.Sadly, this is all something we've seen before, in one form or another, and with anime like Black Clover still running, this dose not stand out enough to keep my full attention. The music is good, but not grate. The characters are good, but not grate. The visuals are good, but not grate. And worst of all for this show, it kept reminding me of other shows.I have no doubt that this will be a good show, I know I'll check out the next few episodes, but I have strong doubts it will rise to the top, after all, it's just going to get compared to shows like Fairy Tail, and Black Clover, two shows that are already established, and ongoing. This show is sadly going to suffer from coming out in a overstated market.",4
radiant,"I'm going to be frank, this was not a good first episode. It was decent, but too much time was wasted on establishing shots and scenes that weren't relevant to the story. We went halfway through the episode without much of anything happening. The narrative exposition that was given told us about the world, but that was it. We don't know what a sorcery really is or how their magic works.As first episode should establish these things. Set up the rules and plot that the show is going to follow. Right now our MC just seems to be there and doesn't really contribute anything to the narrative. The whole episode felt very underwhelming, but it does show promise.The background characters were also very poorly done. Not only did the voice acting suck, but there was no reason for them acting how they acted. Showing that much animosity. The episode missed a huge chance to showcase WHY the people don't like sorcerers. Instead we're just told they don't like them cuz they got their powers from Nemesis, but without any idea what the nemesis are or what damage they've caused there is a huge disconnect between the people's actions and how we're supposed to feel about it. The art and character designs looks really good, the animation is also very clean and smooth. I'll keep watching because this show has potential. Hopefully by the second episode they'll have figured out what needs to be done and set the ball rolling.Rating 3.5/5PS. I really hope the main character's voice actor gets better because, good gravy, he sounds atrocious.",4
radiant,"The first episode was fairly good and definitely showed promise for an interesting plot with interesting characters. However, while the plot is mediocre, the characters are very terribly thought out. The main characters ""Seth"" and ""melli"" are so retarded that I cringe every time I try to watch this show. It feels like they have the same IQ as Dora the Explorer. So if your IQ is low enough to unironically enjoy Dora the Explorer without the aid of drugs, this is the anime for you!",1
radiant,"2 Stars for being barely better than nothing in a genre that I like.Any TV series that puts the ""political message"" before the show is the definition of propaganda.  I cannot forgive an artist for putting propaganda in his/her art. The first season about nonsensical immigration (who would pay for air travel to immigrant to the worst place on the planet).  The second in season two where the leader of the army is a female that literally says this, ""There are many actions that men are always praised for; but when women behave the same way, she'll be labeled as impertinent.""  Meanwhile, she is doing a horrible job hiring buffoons and deviants to be in charge of the army.Updated to: One StarThe character Seth is being voiced by a petite japanese woman, Yumiri Hanamori.  Also, the English dub is being voiced by a man, Christopher Llewyn Ramirez.  So, obviously they were too lazy or incompitent to hire a male to voice the main character of the story, making the Japanese version sound queer.",4
radiant,"Radiant never really got me hooked for the next episode it was always a ""laborious"" task to watch every episode each week. But thankfully during episode 13, we have a political agenda being pushed which gave me an excuse to stop watching the show! The Villains have substandard writing with no real goal but being evil, but this show even fails at truly portraying the villains. I'm a conservative Republican son of a bitch and believes that illegal acts like illegal immigration and the individuals that participate and/or are part of the crime should be prosecuted at the full extent of the law. So having a villain that is portrayed as such just because he is against illegal immigration seems weird and stupid just like pro-illegal immigration activists. I would have given this show one star but the series seems to have a lot of potential and a cool theme (You could say this for a drawing from you're 4 years old girl) this is why I give this show 2 stars. sorry for the long review. If you made it to the end good job and go watch Legend of the galactic heroes instead of this shit.",1
radiant,"This is a review for episodes 1 and 2. This is not the final verdict.This show looks really good. The animation is smooth and transitions well but I can't give it more than a 3 star review because I cannot bring myself to like any of the characters yet. All the characters are pretty awful. The main character is a bratty, naive kid who doesn't understand that his actions have consequences. His mentor is better because she understands how the world works but is just kinda mean and cold to all other characters. And the background characters, oh my god, they are the worst of all. They hate the sorcerers, why, never fully explained, they HATE with a passion both the MC and his mentor. They hate them for almost no reason, and when Alma, the mentor, tries to fix the MC's mistake they don't show any gratitude, not a single drop. They have the upmost despise towards them. It makes me question why the sorcerers would even want to do anything for these characters. The MC is like at most 14 and these grown ass adults are calling him ""infected scum"". No 14 year old would risk his life for people that hate him with such passion, (this is just nitpicking but it bothers me a bit). Also, my favorite character so far has been the leader of the Bravery Quartet, and that's not a good thing.Anyway this show may not be the best anime this season but it could be (but that won't be saying much). The show looks fantastic, one of my favorite styles which is why I'm disappointed in the characters and writing so far. I hope this show improves and develops the characters to stop being so narcissistic and arrogant. You should watch it and make the judgement call yourself because maybe you might actually like the characters. This show has potential and looks beautiful but I can only give it 3 stars.P.S. The main character's voice makes my ears bleedP.P.S The OP shows the title twice... seems a little weird...",3
keep-your-hands-off-eizouken,"I'm in love with this anime!  When it comes to artwork, and animation, this may be the best example of less is more that I have ever seen.  Simple art.  Simple animation.  Simple design.  And what do you get?  SIMPLY AMAZING !!!   Alongside that, the three main characters are very distinct, very different, and all very interesting.  This anime isn't just about creativity, it stokes the very fires of creation that burn in all of us at some level.    AOTY ?    Oh hell yeah !!!",5

It's three high school girls that embody the animator, director and producer role in anime production. The only thing that holds them back is their creative imagination. Science SARU and director Masaaki Yuasa return after wowing the community with Devilman CRYBABY. The shows aesthetic is gorgeous yet awe-inspiring through its simplicity. You have to appreciate the team by throwing in little hints and bringing their own flair as the animation production studio. I was wondering what the two black links and dot was on the main image. Now I understand.",5
keep-your-hands-off-eizouken,"From the 1st Episode Eizouken is screaming at you, ""Don't think about structure, think about Imagination."" as the real world itself is very tight, and compact. As an example, a doorway has a Air Conditioning unit block half of the top opening, forcing the characters to duck under.The plot itself seems generic, a girl who wants to make artwork but her parents are holding her back for whatever reason. But when you get to the last section, that's when Eizouken shows it's true meaning, ""Imagination.""Your introduced to their inner minds, dreaming of how a drawing becomes a jet that resembles a dragonfly, and watching how their imagination shows it taking off and flying.It's like how kids are at the beach, creating sand castles, then having the ocean rushing in to destroy the castle or roleplaying soldiers raiding it, only in Eizouken you sees that Imagination animated to showcase the creativity.While it's only the first episode I look forward to this journey and the fun that it entails.",5
keep-your-hands-off-eizouken,"This anime has an amazingly good feel to it. It embraces older animation styles and feels like a ghibli movie. The characters feel real and tie together in a wholesome way, the animation is beautiful with incredibly small details that one would overlook, and watching it makes you want to explore whatever world the three main characters have created. And while there is a lot happening at once, it's not to the point where you have no idea what's going on. There's no need for useless explanation because you can understand what's happening, even if you don't really understand it. This is without a doubt the winner of winter 2020.",5

Dynamic creative use of animation, different character designs which are simple yet, or perhaps because of it, expressive. Detailed. yet simple world? Again, making use of what anime is, distilling elements down to poke our imaginations. The world is drawn, but evoking childhood, these worlds you drew are alive in your mind, there's a sequence in this ep that in fact directly addresses this! Fun characters too and fun bits that will bring a chuckle. And if you like meta, this be pretty meta with anime within an anime inspiring an anime character to make an anime with a world based on the school in the anime. My hopes from PVs has been realized so far, hope it keeps up!",5
assassins-pride,"Weird sexualization of children, overpowered, Kirito-like protagonist.I don't know what it is with the anime community that they are into these god-like protagonists who are, at the same time, the most selfless, righteous figures imaginable and then two seconds later are coldblooded, cutthroat badasses. There are no people in the world who can be both, so it comes across as forced and disingenuous. I've watched two episodes and at this point I really don't see what redeeming quality this show has EXCEPT that it isn't Isekai. Just look at the art for the poster, and you got a helpless underage girl dependent on a self insert in his early 20s. You do the math, fill in the blanks.",3
assassins-pride,"*Review as of Episode 1* I randomly came across this manga and fell in love with it so I was stoked to see it was getting an anime adaptation. As of the first episode, however, a few things stood out to me. Please keep in mind that these are all just my observations, being someone who knows where this story goes. First of all, the first episode doesn't do a very good job of world-building. It just kinda throws you into it without a whole lot of explanation. This might flesh out a bit over more episodes but I feel the first episode should at least get the viewer interested in where the story is taking place and what the characters are doing there. Second, there seemed to be quite a few scenes of silence where characters just looked at each other while the camera just cut back and forth. I know this is meant for dramatic effect and is supposed to draw out the nuances of the characters' emotions but I felt it was waaaay too drawn out. Just nitpicking a little bit- nothing too major. And lastly:  Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideI felt the scene where Merida got her mana was rushed and not explained at all. Hopefully in the next episode or so they go into more detail but they portrayed it very poorly here. THAT BEING SAID... This series is going to be one I will be watching every week for sure. I know how good this story is and I think that Merida's character as the underdog who has everything to prove through sheer work and determination is wonderfully shown here and will only get better. Again, don't let these little nitpicks of mine turn you away from this show- it's gonna be a good one.",2
assassins-pride,"I watched the full First Episode: They cut out 80% of the content. I read the Manga, I was excited to share the Anime with my brother who hasn't read the manga. At the 5 minute mark in the anime I had to pause this series to explain what on earth was going on. If I screenshot the 4 random scenes they gave us with no context you'd have as much information about the series as my brother. At the 5 minute mark in the anime as in the manga, you would already know the plot and even the Main Character's personality. They cut plot relevant and character building content, even in the scenes that they showed in the anime they cut content throughout the entire episode. They cut content that would have made transitioning from scene to scene not so confusing as well. Safe to say this episode was extremely disappointing for me, and confusing for my brother. Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideBegining intro of battle scene where someone's dead > Suddenly in a Train for some reason > Now we're at someone's house???? Ah, they drew things nice, but looking nice means nothing if the story is chopped up finer than ground beef. 2 stars because they at least worked on making it look nice and animating.",4
assassins-pride,"Episode one was rough. I enjoyed the badass action but everything else felt way too rushed. Here is a ""short"" summary of what happened: An elite assassin investigating a murder scene leading to a top secret mission to get rid of the daughter of a noble whose dream was to awaken her superpower and join the most prestige Legion in a world haunted by monsters, only to change his mind half way through and instead put his life on the line to help her awaken her inner mana by...kissing? Whoa, slow it down. This is at least two episodes worth of content and I honestly felt too bombarded by information to enjoy much of anything. I can see how manga readers would think this is no big deal, but for someone like myself who had never read any of it, this is a huge issue. Anime is never fun when it's rushed like this. There are other things that bug me aside from the pacing, for example why the heck was she standing on the literal edge of the balcony if she knew she didn't have super powers like the others? And also the whole thing about MC's change of heart leaves so many questions...was MC just like her at one point in his life? Is that how he came to know the method to awaken one's mana that nobody else seems to know? Did he really have to drink the potion then mouth feed it to her in order for this to work?? I don't know. There is just too much going on in this episode and I hope they can pace it out better. For now, this is a solid 3/5 for me.",2
assassins-pride,"Just finished episode 5.Every episode of this terrible show just skips around so much. I haven't even read the manga and I can tell how much is missing. And the worst was Ep 5. It just cut 15 minutes of fighting/story.Fight starts, 15 seconds later it skips to an entirely new location and the fight is ending, with no actual fighting in-between. It just skipped all of the plot relevant fighting. And it did it for 2!! of the fights in this ONE episode. The big plot tournament thing was a single fight that lasted about 30 seconds then turned into a hug-fest.And SO much of the backstory has clearly been missing from every point leading up to this.",2
assassins-pride,"To preface this, I'd never read or even heard of the manga before watching this, so I don't have any preconceptions or expectations, either to be disappointed by or to keep me hopeful for the future of this anime.With that out of the way, I can say that as a new comer every single thing about the first episode other than the art and voice acting was terrible. The main offender was that they gave no context to anything that happens, leaving me not just wondering why something happened but shouting ""WHAT? WHY?! THAT MAKES NO SENSE!"" at the show, multiple times. To give an example:Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideAt the end of the episode, the MC goes out to assassinate the little girl because he had concluded that she's an illegitimate child, and happens upon her being attacked by some monsters. He at first clearly doesn't care (I mean, he was searching for her to kill her anyway, after all) and simply watches dispassionately for a while as she's beaten to death. Then, with no discernible trigger or reason, he suddenly jumps in, saves her, declares her his princess that he would do anything for, and gives her magical powers... by kissing her, a middle school girl. You know, as one does. It would be comical, if it wasn't done in such an overly-dramatized fashion.If that weren't bad enough, the cinematography has absolutely no redeeming qualities. If anything happens that could be construed as significant, the way this anime lets you know is by jumping back and forth between the faces of the characters involved for an excruciatingly long period of time while they do absolutely nothing; the MC catches the little girl as she falls off her balcony? Watch them stare at each other unmoving for a solid 15 seconds, just to make sure you know that it was meaningful. It's like if a soap opera had an illegitimate child with one of those terrible female wish fulfillment shojo animes where all attractive males instantly fall in love with the MC. And like with the plot of this anime itself, that illegitimate child should have been assassinated. When I say ""aggressively terrible"", I really mean it; it's not the sort of thing that's so bad that it's good (to me, anyway), there's nothing funny about the show's failings. It takes itself so seriously and tries so hard that when it fails so spectacularly it's like watching a trainwreck; I legitimately struggled to finish one single episode because it was so painful to watch, and I'll give most anything at least 2 episodes, usually 3. Really the only positive thing I can say about this is that the art is generally good, both in character designs and in animation, so if that's all you care about then I suppose this is fine. If you want literally anything else out of the anime you watch, don't torture yourself by watching this.",1
assassins-pride,"So first eps had some fast pacing which isn't really bad, but sense iv read the manga i figured i know what was glossed over and can keep watching but slowly they butchered this show with giant gaps of information to the point where i realized no one could possibly be following this without manga or LN knowledge ...i liked reading the manga for this show a lot, I actually cared for the characters for their drives and motivations but this anime had become void of anything resembling the story i read, they could still have pulled this anime off if they had just tapered the pacing of  the story but for some reason it needs to go at light speed so you can hardly tell what happened much less follow the plot even if you did read it. all in all this was a mess i give it 1 star i recommend you read it instead D- for execution!",3
assassins-pride,"This show is really uncomfortable to watch. All the girls having skirts that go as far down as their hips aside, It's about a samurai assassin in his late teens falling in love with a 9 year old naive and sheltered child. The premise of the show is actually really interesting. Dude is sent by the nobility to see if shes a basturd child of the father but ends up wanting to save her instead while everyone else around her wants her to fail. Unfortunately, the love story aspect and the outfits are just way too uncomfortable. Ive watched a lot of harem animes in my day that made me cringe but never like this. This show is seriously grose.",1
assassins-pride,"Unless you're a Lolicon there shouldn't be much here you'll enjoy. It's a shame too, because the artistic direction and animation in the very beginning of the 1st episode was great and full of promise--aaaand then our MC meets the loli-bait and the show drops off a cliff. Utter garbage. I've seen just over 300 complete anime series, and this is honestly one of the worst I can remember. It's just a complete waste of some pretty good animation.Apparently an ""assassin's pride"" is grooming a small child.",1
assassins-pride,"I know literately nothing about this show its only been 2 episodes and she just had a major accomplishment, if they keep on with this ""Ima jump past like 23223 things and just give you the synopsis of the story "" I think ill stop watching ... The animation is awesome so ill give it a few more episodes (currently on 2) to see if they can fix this.Why the anime seems to be progressing so fast is beyond my faintest ideal episode 2 feels like any other single seasons episode 10-11.",1
assassins-pride,"I don't know how the series will progress but after episode one it seemed to me like the anime was rushing to tell more of it's source material than it's other versions (LN/Manga). In just one episode they covered up to chapter 5 in the manga, and cut out around 80% of the dialogue which made the show loose quite a bit of nuance and important context. (The MC is a lot more aloof and almost bipolar in the manga, swapping between a joking persona and an unhinged assassin who's stuck in a bad spot, in the anime so far they've shown him as an edgy white knight when his character doesn't usually fit that bill at all.I want this show to succeed because the LN/Manga are a lot of fun and have a lot of potential, however if it doesn't correct course by episode 3 I think I will drop it and just enjoy the story in other forms.",1
assassins-pride,"Assassins Pride has a great story to follow where our protagonist Vampir Kufa learns out about the illegitimate child of the Angel Household. 1st of all the anime compared to the manga felt extremely rushed. If not for the manga I would be completely confused on the key concepts and background information on both Kufa and Melida. This anime's story line on the other hand is magnificent, following Melida's determination to join the Crest Legion and how hardwork should pay off. Overall this anime has a fascinating story to go with, although you are left in the dark about key information that would be beneficial to the character development. Give Assassins Pride a try, but I warn you now if you want a quick show and mindless anime to watch for the season this is the anime for you. On the other hand if you do love the story line like me and want to learn more about the characters go off and read the manga.",3
assassins-pride,"It turns out to be a mediocre show. The MC is under a certain Organization and he's been ordered to investigate the heir of the Main Family by the Head of the Family. If she is to be deemed unworthy, she dies (MC proceeds to assassinating her). However, the MC [an assassin] found something unique about her. He decided to let her live under his supervision with Tutor-Pupil relationship. He then covers up her secret of being an illegitimate heir with his life on the line to protect the pitiful little lady. -Characters. Every single one of them are recycled and clichéd. The MC is interesting to me, at the very least. :D-Fighting scenes. Well, it isn't that good. If you have seen Demon Slayer fights, this is child's play. Boring. Bland. Watch it and you will see a big difference.-Animation, Art, music, bgm, and sound effects are good. In fact, pretty darn good.TL,DR: Overall, 6/10 for the anime. The characters are not really all that interesting. The age is also quite a factor. I am not comfortable watching 11 year old kids trying to beat each other to please the adults. Also seriously, all of them are girls. Really? He's supposed to be a teacher/tutor but, he barely taught her anything. Other than supervising a practice match. Teacher my ass. The Manga is well developed while the anime is rushed. I'd rate the manga 8/10.",3
assassins-pride,"This anime seems to be a patch job of tropes that are poorly stitched together. There are many important things they don't even show happening / skip over. It feels like watching a show with someone who every 5 seconds is pressing 'skip' or 'fast-forward' on the remote.Example (very minor spoilers): one second there's an event that's a week away that they're going to train for; then, the next second the even is happening. There's no training montage, no cut to morning of where character's waking up, just boom now we're at the event.Some of the characters seem a bit flimsy. Though this could just be due to the previous point. Example (no spoilers): in the course of like 30 seconds, one character goes from ""I cannot accept this person, it goes against who I am"" to ""I must see their dream come true and dedicate my life to them"". I feel like it could have been decent or good, maybe even great; but with the atrocious story progression and flimsy character tropes, it is a terribly executed anime.",1
assassins-pride,"I've never seen so many overused themes and characters in my life. If there is a common trope, this series has it. None of this is spoilery, because I promise you that you've seen it all before. A dark-haired edgey boi that is apathetic and calculating, but gets somehow instantly attached to the blonde loli that needs protecting at all costs! She shows him an accidental panty shot and falls off a balcony into his arms in the first ep. Aww, isn't she just so sweet and clumsy, and does her best! Goes right into a stereotypical tournament arc right after. Bleh... Avoid it at all costs.",1
assassins-pride,"bland characters, forced conflicts, absolutely no character development, the script forcibly attempts to evoke emotion from me by causing conflict but ive known the characters for less than 1-2 episodes so why the hell would i care?? bro im BEGGING YOU, PLEASE JUST PACE THIS AND DEVELOP CHARACTERSalso the general idea and concept is overplayed and boring and every single female character in this show made me so angry its just not funny.",1
assassins-pride,"The pacing is awful, there is no such thing as character development, or any substantial world building. Just a bunch of cliche shoujo lines thrown together by one of those AI's that can write terrible ""stories"" if you give them a topic. Even the parts that are supposed to be satisfying just feel wrong because you don't even understand how they got to this point. Main character is supposed to be a heartless assassin but then he just submits himself to helping her for no reason that has no explanation making it feel so out character and just wrong. Don't watch.",2
assassins-pride,Tldr: don't watch. other animes do the brooding character theme better.As far as the first episode goes. It's pretty dang boring. From characters to scene presentation.Starts off with an action scene that is over and done in roughly thirty seconds to try to captivate you. Then it decides it's a great time to just lore dump all over you. I'm more of a show dont tell kind of guy. Also the MCs goals are all over the place so I'm not really sure what's going on. As far as art goes. Its decent. Nothing amazing. Although the MC looks like hes had a stroke at some point in his life.One last tidbit. I'm not sure if the author understands what the word lycanthope means as in the anime it just seems to mean monsters in general. Maybe there's werewolves later but all we really got were dudes with pumpkin heads.,3
assassins-pride,"As of Episode 1...Theres a few hiccups in the first episode where it seems a bit generic or flat, or maybe its just that the anime has difficulty portraying the scene and feelings of what was intended in mangas and light novels. However, the art is good, the story line and situation being seen thus far seems quite different and interesting. As of episode 1, few minor complaints include the opening scene, no one shoots a gun like that in that situation nor do they act calmly to a man cutting bullets with a sword slicing up dudes next to him. Second, at 1450 he uses a tool to jump higher, but immediately after just straight up jumps higher without it or it being visually seen...If you can jump that high, why do you even need a tool. Anyways, Im sure it'll be more useful later or reasons we have yet to be unveiled but looking forward to this and a few other animes these coming weeks.Episode 2Cliche fight against bullies in tournament, bully becomes friend, etc. Im glad they skipped the unnecessary training montage but they hardly had a chance to give proper backstory to these things. Not a bad episode, does alright, seems like a show full of Size A Lolis fighting each other clad in various colors. Still not a lot of backstory on the whole world building and such but I'll continue watching. Its a good show as a time killer but not a super special one. I will say the art is very colorful and the art is pretty well done. Above average against all the other animes that have been being released lately, so its a slight change in that aspect.So Ive been watching every week since the first episode, while episode 1 showed some promise and interesting world building and such, it was never touched in exchange to rush the story. Coming to episode 6 which is completely fan service filler and also completely pointless They hardly speak about any of the things outside of the school which is cringing because its all Lolis and cats from their uniforms to the hoodie night gowns in trash (episode) 6. Im sure the manga is better but from what I can tell, not by much. Theres so much content not given and its almost entirely focused on little girls theres hardly anything worth making it to watch now. I was interested to see why the whole city is transported by train in a giant chandelier, I was interested to see what social class system this had, wondering why theres so much prejudice with non mana users or even wtf mana is, why theres lycanthropes, or vampires and lycans are compared, or even what is this land of eternal night they occasionally go on about. This show could have gone better and had all the right elements to do it, but they didnt, they just rushed the first few episodes and seemingly ditched any good stuff and then they give us a filler episode...what the actual F are they doing? I watched because i figured theres much more story if they're rushing this much, but this show has lost all my interest and what little respect I had for it left over. Most trash shows kinda make me want to read the manga and see otherwise, but this is not the case here, I can't do this to myself anymore, This is dropped, no disrespect to anyone who likes it, but for the majority, just skipTL;DR If you like cats and lolis, sure watch it if you have ABSOLUTELY NOTHING BETTER TO DO. Otherwise, skip, its not even worth your free time and both story and presentation is atrocious.",3
assassins-pride,"I have not read the LNs but do plan to because one of the positives of this show has been the interesting world they built for the characters to inhabit.  A 22 to 25 episode run would have done the property justice and let us get to know some of the supporting characters better and helped with some of the pacing problems but we get what looked like three novels from the series crammed into 12 episodes.  I get that the payoff we want from a finale is the end of the third book but that is asking too much; four episode per novel is about 80 minutes of run time each and I've yet to see a 90 minute movie do a novel justice so the producers and show runners were setting this up to fail (I understand it doesn't line up with your 13 week seasons but that means you world build and tell only the first story or have a little faith in the IP and pony up the extra season before getting a chance to see how market takes to the show).  A general understanding of honorifics (and the meaning behind their use or absence) always helps when trying to unravel some of the relationships and there is some lazy subtitling that could rub viewers the wrong way (and localizing a sub can be a thankless job but when a concept behind a name is so important to understanding a character I need you to try a little harder than the literal translation in quotes).  Goods:  Interesting world/setting, action bits are well animated, OP is very catchy. Others:  Pacing is all over the place, characters end up with half explained motivations that don't always match the choices they're making, the age difference will add a layer to the MCs relationship that some will find hard to feel good about (I don't think Kufa feels a romantic love for Melida but some audiences aren't going to like the bond they share or understand how it isn't romantic).  Overall give it a try if you're looking for a fantasy that might be a little off the beaten path but twelve episodes goes by quick and will leave you with some questions (which based on the LNs success I assume are answered in that medium if you're willing to pick up a book and read).  Three and a half stars if I could give out halves.",1
assassins-pride,"The opening episodes show a desolate world where the last of humanity struggle in the lantern city, then as soon as the show puts focus on the the two main characters relationship everything about the city and background was just forgotten. Next, They bring up lancathropes as the main enemy to humans but shortly forgotten and only used to describe the main characters ""dark side"" which why is he a vampire with no backstory. Let's not forget about this late 20's government official assassin vampire has legit touched every part of the 12 year old girl promoting pedo activity then end with nothing about vampires, the lancathropes the lantern city the world the state of humanity the relationship no all of this random shit to tell us he takes pride in his student, show has no baseline no plot no consistency its shit",3
assassins-pride,"The premise of an assassin and a somewhat neglected noble daughter teaming up together is quite an interesting one. The ideas for this show are, in my own humble opinion, very intriguing and quite sophisticated for what you would call a ""typical"" magic girl series. I highlight the typical part because it is actually not that typical, making this show something that had me quite excited when I started it.The show's setting makes for a very gritty approach, so I felt that some of the inclusions such as the infamous ""girl gets jealous and grabs breast of another girl"" scenes were out of place in this anime, despite the cute moments that were definitely there.For anyone thinking about this anime: do give it a go. The story and setting is ingenious enough to get one warm for a nice show and I did feel like it was one, up untill episode 8-9.To expand on this: (this part will have light spoilers)I felt like the story in the first few episodes, right untill the end of the ""tournament arch"" couldve made a good season by itself. by expanding the details and becoming attached to the progress of this MC package, as well as adding a little bit of backstory.the ""village arch"" right afterwards was an arch that i felt couldve even be included in that season possibly. a great story where you could really get to the heart of characters other than the MC package and with a bit more actual showing of the scheming behind the scenes etc it couldve been amazing. to be completely honest the last ""arch"" was a complete mess of things and felt so out of place that my heart completely lost the feel of the world I was sensing before. i cant help but feel like if they had taken an approach to this anime similar to the anime ""overlord"", it could have been so much better. for example, imagine a bit more care for just the tournament and village parts in the first season and then slamming people with a second season all about doing whatever the third part was supposed to be right, showing the story from multiple sides and really getting in tune with the surroundings of the world. if they had done that, maybe in next years winter collection, I feel like it could have been a lot easier to process. such a shame, but nonetheless I did enjoy the first 2 parts of the show for what they were.",1
assassins-pride,"*edit* after watching the last couple of episodes it's been lack luster. still an interesting story but the pacing of the show is really off, and has been off since the beginning I've retracted a star. **It's certainly a flawed show, but a lot of the things about the show that are good often are missed. I believe the primary flaw is the title. It seems that the developers wanted to have a cool English name which appeals to the Japanese but because the Title doesn't give due justice to what the show is about it falls short for most American viewers expectations. It is definitely a ""vampire romance story""(twilighters delight) with action and magical girls. and the story is not fantastic or well paced. HOWEVER, The animation/visuals, the music, and the sound are some of the most well done I think I've found in an anime to date. whoever mastered their audio I want to shake their hand. voices give proper reverb based on location, the exact expected footstep sounds added in for location, and so much more blew me away. additionally I don't know of an OP/ED I've enjoyed more in the last year or so. I've watched it every time so far (especially the ending credits; the vocals are F****** ON POINT, absolutely beautiful). Also, the colors and visual art style is superb. Honestly I believe if the title were different then it may have attracted a different audience and wouldn't have had such harsh reviews. It's definitely a beautiful and well done show. Hell, even the world it's based in is interesting if you pay attention to subtleties. The story is simply lacking luster, partially due to expectations. If you want to watch it. don't go into the show expecting a very dark menacing show, expect an action-drama-romance. You'll likely enjoy it more that way. Thanks for reading!",1
assassins-pride,"Pros: This anime is something that I personally believe anyone could sit down and watch all the way through. The soundtrack for this series is amazing, and the animation style is bearable (barring a few select scenes). The characters (for the most part) aren't completely fluff and have some backstory and development as the anime progresses. The anime comes from a strong pedigree of light novel volumes and a good manga (meaning anything you can't understand in the show, or want to know more of can be further researched in the other mediums.) Cons:There is a lot that the producers left out in terms of core lore and content. It is unsure if this was the way that the production team intended the anime to come out (due to budget or otherwise), however, from my perspective this anime will likely fall short of anything but a brief and unmemorable seasonal anime.",3
assassins-pride,"Everything in this, from the dialogue to the basic setting, reads like a parody of trash anime. The characters don't act like people, the writing is atrocious, and it takes every creepy anime trope and dumb powerfantasy idea and dials them up to eleven.This would all be fine if that was the intention. Instead we have an anime so bad and absurd that it should be funny, but instead it's just sad how bad it is.",3
assassins-pride,"you know i tend to watch one trashy anime per season just to keep my senses fresh for when i go to watch and judge other more well known titles, and for starters this one looked cool from the cover art and the first three episodes where good on a level of average nothing crazy although ep 3 was hype af and the sound tracks are actually awesome, animation solid and quite pleasing to look at the highlighted characters when using mana has a really cool effect.which then brings me to the biggest problem.... the direction, plot, and tone...its EVERYWHERE after 9! ep i can tell you little to nothing about this show not because they don't tell you because they place it right in front of you, say ""here"" and then almost as soon as you pick it up they are on something completely different... there is ABSOLUTELY no emotional connections with this. As a casual viewer of this show i feel nothing about when people in it get hurt upset happy mad... i mean its just empty, combine that with a plot that rushing faster than Usain Bolt its almost like it doesn't want you to enjoy what it's presenting... it might as well be a slide show passing through key frames. Lastly i hope this doesn't go the UQ Holder route where the first like 3-4 ep where it is really good pacing and has awesome action and then it just does a complete 180 to rush everything and focuses on nothing but alive and ghost harem and goes full moe trash.... now the action doesn't have to be demon slayer levels but it is important when making a action anime to include actual fighting... and to keep viewers in you need to at least keep a pace and give us time to get invested rather than just assume we are.would give one stars but ost and animation keeps it at 2",1
assassins-pride,"I will say the only reason I watched up until episode 9 was one, opening is good and two Rosetti. Literally watched the most recent episodes because I really wanted to give it a shot, first episode not that great, but I was like hey it probably gets better. Fights could be better and longer, but hey it gets better right? But you get to episode 9 and you are like really? They are really over forcing them together. I just can't stand it. Its so cringe. Could have had something good with someone else, but no lets have the 18 year old dude go for the 12 year old. No thanks. I really don't know how this could get over 3 stars. It's a hard pass for me. Not worth a watch anymore.",1
assassins-pride,"I've never read the manga and as such can't be disappointed by things being cut, like a lot of reviews I've read. The story is fantastic, the character building not so much. You get a lot of details about one or two characters and not so much about the others who seem important to the story line. Now that may change in future episodes and I do hope so. It's definitely worth a watch of you're into action anime.",1
assassins-pride,"I have not read the source manga, and the first episode makes me not want to continue the show.Most of the story in the first episode is told through bland exposition dumps. The episode is extremely front-loaded with concepts, plot details and characters that have no relevance to the episode itself. It's all told through stilted dialogue, and the melodramatic dialogue has some real corny bangers.The main character, Kufa Vampir, is presented as a brooding, cool, dark-haired gentleman overpowered hero that we see too often these days. There will be Kirito comparisons. The first episode gives the sense that the hero will do all the saving and the girls only exist to be saved. I don't know if this will end up being subverted later, but it's what the first episode hinted toward.The world looks interesting, but all the background artwork is static and flat. It appears the budget was blown on the early fight scene, because every other shot afterward has off-model drawings. There's an animation of Kufa's feet like 12-inches apart as he walks away from the camera, and all I can think is, ""that's not how legs work.""Character designs are pretty bland: Innocent long-haired blonde, bold and fiery red-head, stoic girl with short silver hair, haughty twin-drill princess, etc. You've seen them all already. I didn't see anything this episode that made me want to continue.",1
assassins-pride,"I haven't read the manga, so I have no idea how the story will progress, but I like what I see so far after viewing the 1st episode. The opening scene had a very ""Sword Art Online"" feel to it, and definitely sparked my interest to continue watching. I think this first episode was quite well done, decent artwork, and interesting concept for the begining of the story arc. I look forward to seeing how the characters of of Kufa and  Melida develop, along with a couple of other characters that were introduced earlier in the episode (which I have no doubt earmarks their return at a later stage).Overall,  I enjoyed this first episode and I hope they keep up the good work in the subsequent ones.",1
assassins-pride,"This feels like a true wrap-up of the 2010's. The final bow out of what too many shows in this decade were, short-handed, quickly put together, commercials for LN sales. We've all been victim to it, something promising, a cool design, an intriguing story, or likable characters. But, it always ends up the same, a letdown of a 12 episode season that is best described as ""just good enough"". The concept of Assassins Pride was fascinating to me, but a lack of effort from the animation department (and likely due to budget issues) turns this potentially hot series into another forgettable seasonal flop. With the right animation and time this could have been something much better than it was.",2
assassins-pride,"Assassin's Pride actually has a lot of good things going for it.  The OP has some nice animation and it's timed to match the beats in the music to the beats in animation.  The animation starts out pretty decent (though it suffers as the series progresses).  The world-building is very cool!  Most of the characters are kind of interesting.  But the main character, Kufu Vampyr turns this show into a dumpster fire.  His main purpose is to be a power/chivalry fantasy stand-in for the target audience.  Almost everything he does and says is pure cringe.  It's fantastic!  I kept thinking about how much better it would be if he just wasn't in the show.  The story could be reworked in minor ways to remove him.I see a lot of complaints about this show being pedo-bait, but if I'm being honest, Kufu is probably like 15, and the girls are 13.  Also, why does this show get trashed, but Shield Hero is beloved?  I don't have a good answer for that.",5
assassins-pride,"There is a lot of plot missing in the anime. The character starts off super weak then all of a sudden is super strong with this training she never shuts up about that we see none of. A lot of times there's no build up to something and it happens out of nowhere with little to no explanation of how it came to be, or the explanation is super rushed. And all the  Children that should be seen as  children",1
assassins-pride,"Well how can we talk about Assassins Pride ? This is the kinda of anime that moves too much fast, in the way that you cannot understand. People are watching this just because of him, to try to understand his history and how he get's there, but still the way that the history goes are really trash. I'm keep seeing because i like the style but it's not good if you wanna risk take you chance but just if you like the style.",3
assassins-pride,"the first 3 episodes of this anime were not horrible. The show showed some promise here and there, and the animation, as well as story, were not the worst i have ever seen at all. The real issue came after these first episodes and it just went from a loose 6/10 for me to a shaky 4/10 by the end of it. The animation quality getting worse and worse, reaching a really low level, especially in the last episode, but also just the story becoming incoherent, nonsensical, as well as simply dumbfounding. It is a shame since i kind of like the concept and all of this show, but how they chose to execute it in this anime is riddled with flaws to say the least. The pacing and skipping in this anime is also one of its major flaws.This is one of the few animes i've watched this year where i would just simply recommend you to not watch it, no matter your likes or preferences. It is just so lacking, that is all.",1
assassins-pride,"Continuing the trend of ""Whatever anime Crunchyroll recommends to me via ads will be terrible,"" I am greeted with an interesting concept that consistently fails in execution. I don't know if they're rushing to finish up a certain amount of the source material or what, but it's incredibly obvious that this show doesn't care about explaining things to the viewer and would rather someone give a one-line explanation in the middle of a fight instead of actually build up to things.They tell the audience that the MC is going to be training the heroine for a week, but they skip all of that time to get straight to the tournament so they can avoid building up any dramatic tension. Then after the big reveal of her skills, she gets in a bad situation so that the writers can flashback to show her training on her own as an attempt to explain why she was able to do a move that even her instructor was surprised by (even though the training showed her practicing it in a different way than was actually pulled off in the fight).They neglect to tell the audience anything about classes when they are obviously a big deal. Different classes have different mana, obviously, but apparently it makes it so that they are only able to wield one type of weapon. This means that the MCs plan to hide the heroine's class is basically impossible from the get-go since he gives her a samurai blade instead of trying to make her use samurai moves with a paladin sword or something. But then the show introduces a class that can copy other classes and we're supposed to act like this is a big surprise even though we know nothing about what a class means at this point. As a matter of fact, that scene tells us more about the Clown class than we've ever learned about Samurai, Paladin, or anyone else we've seen. Not only that, but the writers then assume the audience knows that this Clown class can also perfectly disguise themselves as someone else even though that has nothing to do with using weapons from all the basic classes.Even when the show isn't throwing bad world-building at you, you will still be stuck with confusing character moments. We know nothing about the samurai class except that it seems to be good at battou drawing techniques and phantom weaponry made out of raw aura, but the MC is weirdly able to perform perfect combo moves with people he's never met before and they just gloss over it. Nobody questions it either since I guess we're supposed to have forgotten about it because of the big reveal that happened in the next fight in the museum...wait, why was the MC fighting solo in that next fight anyway? His ally was clearly unharmed since they pulled off that perfect assault, but they don't even give a brief ""I'm going to go check for enemies this way"" line to explain why they split up.I think the biggest punch in the gut though is that even though it feels like they are cutting out all of this worldbuilding to just give us spectacle, they skimp out on the spectacle too. Someone infiltrates a match in a sealed room in order to kill the contestants, the targets barely manage to get to the door at which point the assassin destroys the lock. Suddenly, the MC appears through the unlocked door! (couldn't he have just opened it himself since he has a more powerful class than the assassin?) Time to see the protagonist utterly wipe the floor with this foolish assassin who made him mad! This is going to be awesome! WHAT DO YOU MEAN THE SCENE INSTANTLY CUTS TO A SHOT OF THE ASSASSIN KNOCKED ON THE GROUND A MILE OUTSIDE OF THE TOURNAMENT GROUNDS STRIPPED OF ALL HER WEAPONS!? They literally skipped over the ENTIRE fight!I wanted to like this one. I really did. But it's quite clear to me that either the source material had a terrible writer, or the people who adapted it into an anime simply had zero respect for anything the original did. I may end up looking into the original source material, but right now my expectations have been so betrayed that I don't think I want anything to do with this series right now.",3
assassins-pride,"When you are writing a story that takes place in an entirely fictional world, that world requires a degree of explanation. Assassins Pride totally lacks that. This show is overflowing with the fantasy version of ""technobabble"" that we have no real context of. We are only ever given the vaguest explanations of things are are key points of the show - like why it is so important that the main heroine is or is not the daughter of the duke. We don't know what the monsters are or what threat they pose. We don't know that these people are the ruling class because we never see anyone outside of that class. We don't know what the rules are for mana and how it's apparently different from magic.There's far too much missing context!The age of the girls in this show is also very unclear as is the age of the ""assassin"" and the other teacher. No one looks like they are the age they are claimed to be. I feel like the groundwork is here for a really really cool story and world and characters. But so much detail is missing that we really are left just filling in the blanks ourselves and trying to guess why such and such is important, if at all. On the positive side though, the opening theme is great!Pros:Good musicCool ideas and conceptsCons:Unforgivably bad world buildingBad pacingPlot hole city",3
assassins-pride,"I just watched this entire anime in one day, and I've already forgotten the majority that happened. Now, keep in mind I have only watched the anime, I have no other exposure to this. To me, the plot is essentially an assassin is supposed to get close to a girl, decides to kill her after spending an hour with her. He sees her getting beat up by a gang of pumpkins, pops a boner, then decides to completely forget being an assassin for the chance to have sex with her. As for the three stars, all I can say is that this anime is incredibly average. The OP is a banger, the art style is interesting, but the story is boring and has so many plot holes that I thought I was driving over swiss cheese. Much of what happens is forgettable. If you are looking for something to kill six hours with, then choose this anime. Its fun, just proceed to question your morals at the end after watching a grown man flirt with a 10-year-old for twelve episodes (surprise incest included).",2

assassins-pride,"This series is something id like to call ""stuff you shouldn't watch when the good anime is out of season"". Better yet, just go back and re-watch Dr. Stone,  Demon Slayer or a classic, like Mongolian Chop Squad. Every climactic event in the show goes like this Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hidemelida is in danger, instructor swoops in and saves the day, weird pedo-esque scene ensues between the two, everything is better now.  . Don't waste your time like I did unless you have a skin condition that prevents you from going outside and are completely out of stuff to watch.",3
assassins-pride,"After watching the anime as a whole, at times I find myself forgetting the main story, with so many story arcs covered in such a short amount of time confuses me as to what the point is. Speaking of time, the story paced itself quite poorly with covering i assume a single year within 12 episodes, not to mention there is a filler in a 12 episode season! Some story arcs were interesting but I was more invested in the main story and they only really covered it in a few episodes. With many time jumps out of nowhere by episode 12 the once ""incompetent talented girl"" is now able to fight along her half-human half-vampire lancanthrope (the strongest lancanthrope class) sensei against some guy that only ever had 3 appearances. There isn't even a consistent antagonist that lasts for 3 episodes.This anime should've been at least 24 episodes, if you don't want to show backstory for the other characters thats fine but the main characters only got like 30m worth of time to explain their origin. The art was fine till halfway, then the quality dropped from better than good to rushed works.Also saying ""Milady"" (Ojō-sama) is really weird and creeps me out, and i don't think it's just meWhat this anime need is more detail and more episodes.Heres a video on it: https://youtu.be/-EbH6DYnvaM",4
assassins-pride,"Yeah, it may not hold up to most anime, pacing could be better and more could be explained. Though the slow pacing and quality dipped for me here and there, It kept me wanting more regardless. It starts off with a bang and ends quite nicely leaving a good entry for a second season if it gets one.  I can see why this wouldn't be for everyone, but honestly I think people nit pick a lot of things these days and it ends up ruining a lot of decent anime and leaving them to roam only with one season. If you can just relax and enjoy whats there I think most people would rather enjoy more and more. Shows would get more into something great, sometimes they just don't get the chance to find their footing in the first season and possibly could be incredible in the second. Usually just do to people being not found of what they are doing.",1
assassins-pride,"Their was obviously budget issues but it was a decent watch.Lot of you watched it and just complained, but why watch it which supports it?I thought it was pretty good, in no way does that mean its perfect, or a must watch. Just, pretty good. I liked the characters, the color choices were pretty and the plot was pretty nice. Sure maybe sometimes cliche, or to those who didn't as  ALWAYS read the manga, is confusing. Overall 4/5 season 2 pls",2
assassins-pride,"I actually enjoyed this anime, even with its peculiarities. The art is amazing and the music is really nice on the ears. The premise is interesting and the plot reminds me of a Brazilian soap opera. I need a season 2 of this mess ASAP!The final episodes are somewhat too fast-paced but in the end almost everything ties together, with the exception of some open ends for season 2.Overall I'd give this an 8.5/10",1
assassins-pride,"With the bad story writing, and boring world building, the only thing it has to fall back on is the depth of the characters. But that's not very good either, the characters are one dimensional and boring. They have no growth either, each one of them is the same from start to finish. Its not that this is the worst anime or anything, it just has nothing good about it. Except maybe the opening song, its pretty catchy.",5
assassins-pride,"I saw an ad for this show on youtube, and I was looking for a new anime to watch. The first episode intrigued me, but I was very confused. I looked up the manga, which helped me to understand a lot more. I agree with many other reviews that the manga goes into more depth with character and world development, which does help make for a more cohesive anime show, BUT I still like the show! I have to say that this anime is very ""forward"" with the sexual nuances, but it doesn't really bother me (does that make me a perv??? lol). I'm hoping that with future episodes it will show more character development and not skim over some key details (The manga really does have a lot of stuff that isn't covered in the anime), because that will make for a better anime show!",2
assassins-pride,I'm an anime-only watcher and have seen the numerous comments about how the pacing is terrible and doesn't really line up with the manga. I will agree that there are some rough spots and it can be very cliche but I like the MC and find the setting interesting. It does have a lot of wasted potential but I still found myself watching every episode and wondering how it will end. The animation is not the best but it isn't bad and the opening is very catchy and I never skip it. The relationship between the two characters can be kinda cringe because of their age but if you try not to think about it and think about the setting of the story and how they see age you'll be able to get through it.,5
assassins-pride,"First, Pretty decent OPSecond, gorgeous atmosphere and settingThird, the animation is inconsistently great or terrible but the art is usually on pointbut.... WTFlike, its watchable enough that, well, i watched it but it has some serious issues... some of which may be its saving grace?Honestly nothing I can say about this show really covers it.  Its like a crazy fan fic that kept getting close to cool ideas and decided to immediately turn 90 degrees every time it happened.  One character uses magic fire for fricking subtitles and instead of making that an interesting bit of representation for a deaf or mute character, she just turned out to be doing it to be edgy...and that's before we cover the creepy pedo vibe the main... ""couple"" gives off.Should you watch the show?absolutelylook up Mother's Basement's roast of it and you'll understand why.",3
assassins-pride,"When I saw this series, I was rather hyped for it. I thought the animation was great and the story was developing into something more.Now, that the series it out (being at the 9 episode mark) I can understand why people hate this and people like this. On one end of the conversation people hate the loli thing going on, the terrible plot, and the generic, apathetic, and ""black haired"" MC. On the other end people say that their age is of a 4 year difference (will get to this later), and they do admit that some arcs may be a little shabby but the story line itself is nothing to frown at, and how the MC is actually not a generic character but a lot different.And I for one can tell that they put a lot more work than other animes into the characters.Now heres my opinion on the loli part: I honestly don't mind, just like I hate harems I can still find a way to actually see why the series is good. For me a 13 year old and a 17 year old SHOULD NOT BE DATING, but I do think that at the point of legal age its ok, like seriously whats the fret?Im keeping this review at a 3 star because I can see why people hate this and people like this, so if your thinking about watching this anime keep that in mind.",3
assassins-pride,"Putting aside that this anime has massive pacing issues, they don't bother developing the characters or the story at all, and there are massive plot holes— I just can't this show. I can't. Nine episodes of watching an older man take advantage of his position of power to practically groom this teenager to be his romantic interest. They play up how helpless and tiny and innocent she is, shove her into a corset, then fling her into a situation that just has me cringing and reminding myself that it's an anime and he's not a real pedophile. Nope. Nope nope nope.",4
assassins-pride,"I went into this show knowing it would be kind of bad but after episode 9 I just can’t watch anymore. I’m really over the sexualization of kids and no one batting an eye at what she said in ep.9. Also at this point in the show, I’m just like.. what?? Like the other reviews have said, the pacing really does throw it off. A lot happened in one episode yet it feels like they just threw the information out there just to get it out the way. They’re also really trying to make the two main characters a thing but it’s awkward and extremely cringe worthy. Maybe because she’s like 12 and he’s grown lol.. it doesn’t explain very well why he saved her in the first place, he just suddenly had a change of heart and gets super attached in one episode?? This show could’ve been great but it just missed the mark for me. The main guy is the only one I even slightly care about and the fight scenes are decent, but the characters need more development.",2
assassins-pride,"Animation: 8/10OP: 9/10Plot Potential: 9/10Plot Execution: -2,000,000/10Thus ends my review.In all seriousness: its pretty, and there is potential, but the main story seems to be taking a backseat to the side content. This review is posted as of episode seven. It is ridiculous how much of the main story is just not there at all, even as somebody who has not read the source, it is pretty obvious. Extremely hard to follow after 2 rewatches.",1
assassins-pride,"This show really seemed like it was going to grab me with some of the weird and interesting visuals that it was showing me in that first episode, but unfortunately it's all flash and no substance. Visually this show is fine. There are some neat battle sequences. The first time this show had some spooky jack-o-lantern headed monsters I felt like it was really pitching itself to me as a guy who likes halloween. Unfortunately, I should have seen those jack-o-lantern headed monsters for the big ol' red flags that they ended up being.Assassin's pride is a story about your standard edge-lord anime sad-boy protagonist. His character traits appear to be that he is an assassin, is the strongest sword-user possible, and is too cool to actually have any personality. He's been tasked with killing an incredibly depressed girl who doesn't have the magic combat buff abilities that everyone else in the show has. She's been being bullied by the kids at her magical battle school for not being super strong, but it's okay because she works really hard. Instead of killing he sees her being attacked by the jack-o-lantern monsters, who the show informs us are ""lycanthropes"" and he decides to save her and gift her with magic powers somehow. If you think about all of that for any amount of time, the big ""turn"" in episode 3 will come as no shock to you.It reminds me a lot of WorldEnd, where the world was beautiful but then I hated everyone in it, and I hated everything that was happening. While I wasn't filled with joy, I also didn't hate this show. It's just kind of middle of the road. Nothing it does is surprising or exciting. Three episodes in, it feels like the kind of show I would watch all of if I ended up staying home from work one day because I was sick.",3
assassins-pride,"The title really says it all. If you've been watching anime for the past 3-4 years you know exactly what a standard fantasy light novel looks like. This one is a bit unique in some ways, but overall it's all pretty hackneyed at this point.I'll spare you the story synopsis thus far, you can read that on your own. I guarantee you that none of it will fall terribly far from other ""magic school with a bunch of girls"" light novels. Not necessarily an issue if it's done decently, but there's an issue with ""decently"" already. One of my main issues at the moment is that, outside of how hackneyed it is, the main character just seems to do a 180 on his job and ENTIRE PERSONALITY. It's also difficult to tell who the protagonist is vs the deuteragonist, but that's not necessarily an issue.The title is also hilariously off because for being about an ""assassin's pride"", he sure as hell throws that away very quickly when he abandons his job...Many of the resolutions also feel a bit hollow, but you know that's pretty much standard fare at this point.So why am I giving this a 3/5 instead of like 2/5 or below? The presentation isn't bad, from some artistic standpoints. It's difficult to explain. It's mostly crap, but it's somehow presented decently. The opening is interesting in the way it meshes some of its effects. That's about it, really. It's one of those presents you're not terribly happy about receiving, but in a pretty box.",2
assassins-pride,"I can't really say that I am seeing a whole lot new or different with Assassins Pride. In many ways this is following most of the old tropes regarding some underdog character who works hard and pulls ahead - we've seen this before. However, I suppose it does serve as a good illustration when it comes to depicting the many examples in Japanese Power Fantasy Novels - both for men and for woman; extremely blatantly at that. The anime isn't trying to hide this and pretty well shows a lot of the highlights of what this genre of anime has become.IE, you shouldn't be looking at this anime other then for educative purposes.",4
assassins-pride,"Two words sum this entire show up fairly well.Butchered adaptation.Significant chunks of the source material were removed, most of which helped to increase the depth of the characters.  Moments that solidified their feelings or who they are as people? Skipped over entirely.The fight scenes are also merely OK.  If you've never read the source material you can get some minor enjoyment out of this series.  If you read the source material avoid this at all costs.",1
assassins-pride,"It's set in an alternate realty where a chosen few of the total populace are, simply put,  "" Born "" with a power that enhances their strength. TBH, It reminds me of the old TV show Dark Shadows. I know, its an old reference, but the point is that the atmosphere is bleak and kind of creepy, and the male lead is dark and mysterious. The show has a way of telling the story w/o needing to resort to over the top action, romance, or fan service. If I have a complaint, it would be it a little too melodramatic. Still, I think it's a great anime well worth watching.",4
assassins-pride,"https://imgur.com/a/I5slv07Episode 1 set expectations high. Some really stellar animation, great musical composition, interesting characters. Episode 2 was a little lower on quality, but to be expected. Most anime use majority of their animation budget on the first episode and the last few, come in and go out with a bang.Then episode 3 came. Episode 3 is absolutely disgusting. They colored the manga and put it into Microsoft Word and recorded it with bandicam circa 2006. Oh boy what wasted efforts.",2
assassins-pride,"The cover art caught my eye in the first couple of seconds which is exacty what an anime series needs, a good art style that is pleasing, Assassins Pride conveys this same principle in many ways, the first being obvious, the cover. However, the first episode was lacking in content, it ubruptly ending left people wanting more, which may seem bad, but its a double edged sword in this case. When SAO's first season ended, many people wanted more, however what we got was worse. Think of that, but in this case got better! They surprised me in the second episode, and now i cant wait for the fourth to release and so on. If you havent watched this, i recomend it, and i cant wait till they bring more to the table, especially with the great world, and lore, behind the characters.",1
assassins-pride,"In a post-apoc steampunk fantasy world...no, not Attack on Titan, the remnants of humanity live in what amounts to a giant chandelier (which looks like jolly old England on the inside.) Monsters dwell in the dark, beyond the reach of lanterns, threatening our existence. Anddddddddddddd, that's not the focus here. Instead, a professional assassin is hired to tutor the ""incompetent talented girl"" of a noble family who has yet to awaken her magical powers. If she doesn't manifest the abilities of her house, he has orders to kill her. And yet, upon seeing her spirit, he takes it upon himself to foster her growth and protect her, even at the risk to his own life. Chivarly, sword fighting, and familial intrigue abound in this victorian-style (love story?)",3
assassins-pride,"This is just me but im not the nit picking type and i dont like reading manga cause it spoils. but i like the main characters personality towards melida and how he splits his life up so perfectly between being a mentor, and his work life I know it has to be reassuring for melida since she has no doubts about him. I also cant wait to see how melida is when she grows more skilled and what her future is like.",3
assassins-pride,"What's this? Not an isekai?What's this? Plot?What's this? Not a free upskirt, a wholesome show?Actual character development and pacing in the first and second episode???Jokes aside, I do feel this is better than the rest of the anime's this season storytelling-wise, mind you I haven't seen many so take this with a grain of salt. After all these seasons of isekai, isekai, and more isekai, it's nice to have a simple fantasy setting to keep yourself from losing your sanity. I enjoyed the first two episodes enough to say this is a decent show to continue watching and would much rather read it's light novel (11 novels completed according to novel updates but not licensed yet so there's hope with this anime, also it's very well rated as a novel too). Supposedly they cut a lot of content between the manga and definitely the LN (I haven't read the manga because I would rather wait for the LN translation), but anime being anime, pacing is forgiven sometimes since they want to cram later story content as soon as possible. This isn't a masterpiece of a show but has enough good points to warrant watching the season.PS: Is that you kirito?... (⊙_⊙)",3
assassins-pride,"Not sure why but this show got a lot of mixed reviews based on the first episode. So far there is only 2 episodes out at the time of this review which is less than the 3 episode rule but we do have a clear direction of where the series is headed by the end of episode 2. The characters have not been fully developed but so far, the relationship between Melida and Nerva is an interesting one. In the first episode we see Nerva come off as a bully who does not care about Melida and only uses her to torment her and feel superior in a way. However, in the second episode during their fight and after we see a bond between them form when Nerva was the only one to reach out to Melida as her first friend even though she bullies her. After the fight in episode 2, Nerva also apologizes to Melida and basically acknowledges her as an equal after Melida beats her.Another interesting relationship is between Melida and her mentor, Kufa. Kufa has a hard time showing any emotion as he frequently tries to hide it (supposedly to be professional). But, he seems to actually care for Melida despite being all about his mission and ordered to assassinate her if she cannot use mana. He even reveals that if his plan fails then not only she will be killed, but he will as well for not killing her as ordered of him. Overall, there isn't much substance only there being two episodes but compared to other series' first two episodes, I am amazed at how interesting the characters are already and the plot seems good and very enjoyable to watch. I found the time to be flying by while watching the two episodes. I am interested to see how the relationships between Melida and her father and cousin turn out as those are also interesting to find out how they turn out.P.S. I may be a little biased because the plot is somewhat relatable to an anime called the Irregular at Magic High School of which I enjoyed and still wish for a season 2. However, Assassin's Pride, without the cliché high school aspect found in many anime, might make this anime even more unique and better than that anime (although I recommend you go see it if you like this anime so far).",1
assassins-pride,"This is sort of disappointing but then again, the plot was nothing to write home about to begin with. Good animation, good music, good voice acting, but absolute trash plot, which is why I'm dropping it. I don't blame the studio for the product they have offered, they made an effort to provide a quality product, I blame them for taking on this project. You can't make a filet-Mignon, when your base product is only suitable for dog meat.EDIT: If you think you need a 3 episode rule, that's fine. If I know something is trash after 1 episode, I don't then decide to follow it up with 2 more. Once I know it is bad I won't add more pain and suffering in my life, to suit your imaginary ""3 episode rule.""In case you need more info. You are watching a Harem Anime, and anime in which the main character is Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hidea vampire-ninja-samurai if you are not a lonely 14 year old boy, this is pretty much trash.",4
assassins-pride,"Assassin's Pride is a lushly romantic anime, set in a strange bottle world of darkness and lamplight. An assassin must either kill or cure a failing scion of a noble family, and helps her by sharing his magic with her. She must now become an all-conquering warrior in a world of intrigue, shadows and cloak-and-dagger. I'm surprised by how much I'm enjoying it. The heroine Melida Angel is surprisingly tough, and her tutor Kufa Vampir a true gent. It has an odd feel to it, rather like the desolate worlds of a Fumito Ueda game. Though I warn you the director spends a lot of time staring at girls' legs.",2
assassins-pride,"I came home from a standup comedy to this. I was in a good mood, then an art student's undergrad project ruined 25 minutes of my perfect night. The animation is CGI, all of it, even the 2D bits. I like it, it's nice, but the direction, oh God, no. The director wants to use silence for meaning and add drama, it's not working! It's silence, nothing happening, it's not dramatic, it is boring. The premise is stupid, ""if the girl doesn't have MANA her mom's a cheating ... So kill the girl."" Why? Just remove Melida from the will or disown her. Or is this a world where cops don't do work? Why risk going to jail over a cheating person WHO'S ALREADY DEAD? Also these monsters which she goes out to fight, allegedly by the Duke's request, can't kill her? In the episode it is implied she fights monsters on regular basis, ""the Duke pushes her,"" to force a manifestation of her mama. But then she needs statutory rapist to save her? Her tutor is a child molester, it's what we call adults who kiss middle school children on the mouth.So, let's summarize: Average CGI art, some music, lots of silent pauses because ""drama"", lolicon molesting kids, unrealistic premise, inconsistent plot, and no action so far. Nothing that happened is what I would call eye candy, or intriguing, the story has no flavor. And I like my romance legal. I'm not gonna say what should and shouldn't exist in art, but I can choose to critique it. I'm not even taking off a star for it, just a heads up. Two stars for the art and it had a cool setup for the world, but it has no meat on them bones!",3
assassins-pride,"So far so good. The show seems interesting and there is a ton of potential with the plot so far. Though I really don't understand why the kiss was even remotely needed. It seems very weird.The combat does look good though, but there doesn't appear to be any set rules, so I imagine it is going to be shonen esc. Please let there be no more sexualization of a little girl. I would appreciate it if that was left out.",5
assassins-pride,"(Potential Spoilers, but nothing that would ruin any ""plot twists"" that there may be.)I make it a point that if I start a show I finish it. This show was very poorly written and had terrible pacing. No, I didn't read any manga or the LN, and don't plan on it because I'm sure it will be just as bad at this, but with  you guessed it more stuff left in that's bad! As others have already pointed out, there is some serious issues with sexualizing children. Even without that  glaring issue the show somehow manages to make me nauseous. Interestingly enough, the fight scenes are either omitted ( See episode 5, around the end ) or just so poorly animated and awful,  but some scenes like Kufa turning around in the.. dramatic way he does, are actually animated pretty decently. If they had the care to actually animate it consistently throughout the show might just be average, or slightly below.This show is less about the story and more for the disgusting people who think children and fan service go together. It's not cute. It's not remotely appropriate. Some nasty dude probably had a good wank while writing up this train wreck of a story.",4
assassins-pride,"If you are not a pedo you will find this anime disgusting, if you are a pedo you will love all the little girls that are ""13"" no they arent they are 8-12 at best most of them ranging 8-10, and the MC being ""17"" no he isnt he is a 20-30 year old white knight....A lot of sex hinting, grooming of little girls, and perverted/nude scenes with little girls, watched a few episodes cuz i was extremely bored, but once they started the non stop hentai of little girls i almost puked and never touched this again, and recommend anyone that is a normal human being to shun this anime, and if u like it check yourself at a hospital.PS.The anime itself is also pretty fucking bad, altho their opening scene about their bubble like city is pretty cool",4
assassins-pride,"I tend not to give a review at all until a show has ended; however, I made an exception here due to the wave of poor reviews uploaded so early in the show's run.  First off, I loved this series as a manga/LN first and then the anime.  Love the setting (reminiscent of Big-O in some ways), and the heartwarming music and relationships are just magical (similar to Spice and Wolf).  While there are certainly things that were skipped from the source material, the overall ethereal feel of the music and visuals really made the transition to anime worth it for me.  For a couple decades now, I have seen shows that came from manga, Light Novels and (for the past decade) webnovels.  In that time I came to appreciate each medium's own unique characteristics.  Anime, while usually the final product in the group, also needs to sacrifice the most (usually Plot) in order to be fit within a 13-24 episode season and be marketable to a wider audience.  In return, the person who read the source material is blessed with a version of their beloved story with the added dimensions of animation, voice and musical accompaniment.  My advice to those readers who are disappointed: 1. Realize that anime is likely going to be the medium that is most different from the other three and therefore, requires the most sacrifice from the others.2. Understand that the author you so adore put years of work into getting to the point that an anime producer offers them a small window of 13-24 episodes to tell a tiny portion of their story to a wider audience -- an opportunity few receive and even fewer get a chance to repeat.  3. The author's publisher looks to the success of the anime as a barometer for the author's upward potential.  Therefore, publishers tend to give more support to authors whose anime enjoyed greater critical/commercial success (i.e. if you want to see more from an author, it is in your best interest to support anime based on their work).As for the poor reviews, the main reason given for many of them was that the anime cut out story elements that were in the Manga/LN.  Those reviewers predominantly gave 1-2 stars followed by a review that recommends the reader to check out the Manga/LN instead.  If your intention is truly to get someone to support the author/read the original works, the best strategy for that is to give a higher Star Rating and put the critique in your comments.  By tanking the Star Rating (the only thing most people will take the time to look at), you are more likely to keep someone from ever seeking out the source materiel in the first place -- they may even avoid it if they find it.  Hoping that they will wade through the sea of comments to read your detailed explanation/recommendation is woefully optimistic.  And yes, I am aware of the irony of me wading into the same sea with my soapbox...it was just getting too painful to watch.Regarding any claims that this is dishonest/inflating the Rating, I would ask which is worse: being overly positive about a show to get more people who may enjoy it to watch it or being overly negative and preventing people who might otherwise like the show from watching?  I love anime/manga/LN/webnovels far too much to watch them stay mired in the same vitriol, trolling and ""Likes""-hunting that consumes the discourse elsewhere on the internet.  Well that's two strikes against me...I better stop before the internet Dementors come find me and send me to Azkaban to drain me of my excess ""woeful optimism"", lol.",2
assassins-pride,"The anime's whole idea with the main character being a teacher but also an assassin is good.  But the way that they tell and show everything is horrible, don't get me wrong here, the animation is really good, but they seem to lazy when writing their storyline.  In one of the episodes they just skip right over one of the scenes not even bothering to show a little bit which is a very horrible thing for an ACTION anime to do, so I feel if they took a little more time caring about the anime, it would be a 5/5.",3

high-school-prodigies-have-it-easy-even-in-another-world,"When the protagonists are more fantasy than the fantasy world they enter, the only way the show works is as a parody. Sadly, the show has no real humor to it. I've criticized Slime for not having enough humor, but Slime is a laugh-fest compared to Prodigies. There is no suspense and no challenge here, because the protagonists are overpowered and can easily handle any problems they face. The fantasy elements are weak. No explanations are given for the protagonists' superhuman skills, beyond being prodigies. We haven't seen a reason that they ended up in that world. There's no real plot in sight. The show is only good for wish fulfillment, spamming tropes, and a little fanservice here and there.Like Isekai Cheat Magician, this show only exists to cash in on the isekai popularity. There's no real effort put into the writing. Even the main characters are intentionally generic, and don't even use names. Generic merchant, generic magician, generic genius inventor, etc. They're hollow characters in a hollow setting, following the standard tropes aimlessly. But on the bright side, the show doesn't actively annoy me, so it's better than Conception.",2

I understand anime is a wonderful art form, one that means a lot to many. I don't understand why that means everything has to be super serious. All the negative reviews are missing out  on a ton of enjoyment by taking it too serious. It's an absurd story, with seriously OP characters, silly circumstances, and great humor that is derived from those things. I was smiling ear to ear after watching the first episode. Not every movie has to be The Scarlet Letter, and not every anime has to be Baccano! Just like a stupid funny movie like Ace Ventura has a place, so does this show. I love the beautiful animation, the absurdity, the cool powers, and the interesting characters.

high-school-prodigies-have-it-easy-even-in-another-world,"Usually, I can sit through the entirety of a first episode - no matter how cringey the anime may be, however this anime has set a new low. You can tell this anime is a complete cringefest when it features a character with hetrochromia but I could not believe how bad this anime was. All the characters are incredibly overpowered, not even a fun way, with one of the ""prodigies"" being a reporter is able to take out two armed guards in a single blow. That is, in no way resembling her role, and puts Frank West to shame in combat ability (and he's covered wars you know). Also, the characters show little to no concern about being transported to another world with the exception of a magician, who can literally fly - and even then his greatest concern is seeing catgirls. This usually is passable, except the protagonist, is literally the prime minister of Japan. I love the potential of isekai, with many great series such as RE:Zero, and Konosuba existing, but there are so many cheap cash-ins such as this trash that make me wish it could be disposed off for good.In review, don't waste your time on this trash, and Crunchyroll, stop wasting money on cannon fouder shows like this and get some actual good shows.",5

I want to say ""Sure, it's only the first episode."" but I don't think it will be able to come back from this.Romantic baby bird feeding, and sped up acceptance of incredible other worldly concepts by the locals was just too much for me. Like some other reviewers mentioned, the protagonists would probably be decent in some sort of political near-real-world story, perhaps reminiscent of Lelouch of the Rebellion, but they're just boring here.

high-school-prodigies-have-it-easy-even-in-another-world,"This is a very disappointing anime series. As always, many Isekai series come out every year now; most are ""eh,"" while about two are incredible, and the rest are awful. High School Prodigies Have It Easy Even In Another World falls in the last category. As other reviewers have pointed out, the art is the only thing this series has going for it. But every other aspect of this anime is terrible. My chief complaint is that this series is just lazy story telling.There is no character development; all the main characters (MCs) have no reservations about who they are, and their respective relationships/roles in the fantasy world they find themselves in. They don't develop, and show no sign of growth. Instead, they come off as smug and privileged, while believing that they are always in the right.If you want to watch Isekai anime that has great stories, good art, and amazing character development I recommend the following:1. A Vision of Escaflowne2. Re:Zero: Starting Life In Another World3: Overlord4. Saga of Tonya The Evil5. Drifters6. No Game, No Life7. Problem Children are Coming from Another World, aren't they?Not all of these are available on Crunchy Roll, but you should be able to find them out their.If asked, I would say ""don't waste your time on High School Prodigies Have It Easy Even In Another World.Thank you for reading this review!",1

They'll say or do something that couldn't possibly lead to the desired outcome in reality, but the desired outcome just kind of happens because it's supposed to.The problem with creating 7 genius characters in different fields is that at the very least there will be 6 characters whose actions do not match the consequences of those actions.However, as long as you don't think too much about what the characters say or do, the story can be fun at times. I kinda like the premise at least, but then again I just can't get enough of another world anime, so perhaps I'm biased.",1

It would have been more interesting to see the 7 prodigies take over the current world. Am I supposed to be convinced the supposedly OP main characters just sat around for a whole month before they decided to jump on this new world bandwagon? What was the point of making this an isekai and then on top of that, also skipping a month into the story? I don't think I've ever been so unconvinced by an anime before... Maybe if the characters were at least sort of living up to their prodigy expectations, I would be somewhat convinced the story makes some reasonable sense, but now I'm questioning this more than I should for me to enjoy the story for what it is.",1

It knows exactly what it is, bottom of the barrel clearance aisle potato chips. The characters are entirely throw away and even the show itself doesn't bother using their actual names. Refering to them more often by their ""job"". Everyone is purely one dimensional and clearly no effort was made to make them anything else. The author may have intended the story to be a parody of isekai, but I doubt it, it feels much more like a high school fan fiction where they went back and changed the names of the characters so you ""don't know"" which actually good original content they're badly impersonating. Despite that, this show is indeed cheap junk food of anime - and even cheap junk food can be enjoyed at times. It's got fan service, occasionally good, if unintended humor and lots of terrible but fun to laugh at cliches. If you have nothing better to do, you can do worse than waste a few hours watching this.

high-school-prodigies-have-it-easy-even-in-another-world,"This show is not very good.World: The world is your very standard fantasy isekai world. Our heroes end up in a little nowhere village filled with beast people who are being oppressed because they're beast people. Because racism is bad, our heroes decide to help the beast people out. The villainous empire that is oppressing them starts out seeming like your regular fantasy noble evil, and then turns the dial up to 11 to achieve comically evil status by the end.The Story: Is also very standard and very average. Our heroes were all friends, and all masters of their craft, and now they've been pulled into a magical world. Our main guy is a politician, and if you don't enjoy his character you will most definitely not enjoy this show. They run into fantasy society problems that come up when the nobles are the kind of evil you see in fantasy settings, and then they correct them by not being terrible human beings. It's super good that they are there because apparently none of the residents of this magical world ever try to stand up for themselves. I guess revolutions of the populace is just a human world thing.Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideIt does take an unexpected turn when our heroes decide that the way to free the people is by forming a religion. Normally in a fantasy shows, we aren't shy about taking the stance that religions are bad, so it was interesting to see the heroes decide to make their own.In the end though, the story seems to get in a rush to get things done. They had a reveal in the last episode that a villain was still alive, and this shocked the heroes. I couldn't recall that character having died so I was genuinely confused. It felt like maybe something was supposed to have happened there and either I missed it because this show failed to hold my attention, or they had just forgotten to show me the thing that made it make sense. The Characters: This is where this show should do amazingly, but instead it falls flat. All of those characters look interesting, but that is all they are. The characters are papier-mâché effigies, they may look pretty, but it's all on the surface because they're hollow and empty. Maybe if this show hadn't had 7 main characters, or had more than a 12 episode run I would have felt differently, but without the names being written on that poster I would have been able to tell you the name of exactly one character in the show (and it's likely not who you think it is).They try to dig into the politician character when they realize that they need to try and focus on something, but he is exactly what he looks like, an anime sad boy with white hair and a dark past. It's a real shame because the glimpses we get into the lives of all of the other characters are so much more interesting than blandy-man politician. Ringo (The character who's name was the one I remembered) actually does have an episode that explores her past, but once you look at it and what we learn about blandy-man it seems like the writer only writes one kind of origin story. Based on that, I probably wouldn't have been sucked in by any of the other characters had we actually explored their origins more completely.Final Thoughts: I picked up the localized manga when it came out, because my comic-book store clerk knows that I enjoy reading a lot of dumb isekai plot lines. I got about 6 pages in to that book before putting it down and accepting that it was not for me. When I saw the anime I figured I'd give it another shot. I was able to get through all 12 episodes, but it still had all the same problems that those first 6 pages did.Because there are so many characters in this show, it makes it feel like there is too much going on to keep track of. Unfortunately a lot of what is going on doesn't really have much weight. Things ramp up at the end and some crazy stuff happens, but it just feels like stuff is happening and not for any real reason. The villains seem to be evil for the sake of being evil.For a more manageable version of this kind of story I would suggest  Problem Children Are Coming From Another World. It may be two episodes shorter, but it also has less than half of this bloated main cast.",1
high-school-prodigies-have-it-easy-even-in-another-world,"So, I’ve been watching this pretty much all season, and I have some thoughts. This anime is more or less your average isekai with overpowered characters (seven of them in this case) that trivialize any threat or challenge that comes their way. If you don’t  like that in an anime or can’t tolerate it to some extent, then this isn’t your anime. Straight up. This isn’t a good isekai anime. Go off and look up some good ones like Log Horizon and Overlord or something. However, if you can tolerate the mediocrity of the premise, then you’re in for a kind of weird and wild ride. I say this because this show tackles some really dark subject matter, and I’m not sure if they intended it to come across as serious or if it was meant for shock value, but it definitely comes across as shock value. Below, I’m going to go into some detail about what the dark subject matter IS so if you don’t want spoilers, avoid this section. Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideSo, there’s some lobotomy in the most recent episode that I’ve watched, and one of the main characters did it. There’s also cannibalism, fire zombies, murder, sexual assault, and a nuke that I imagine the main characters will use at some point. There’s some really strange stuff here. It’s fascinating in a sort of macabre way. The dark subject matter doesn’t make this anime really worth watching in my opinion, but it’s one of the few things keeping my attention if only for the macabre nature of it.",1
high-school-prodigies-have-it-easy-even-in-another-world,"Let me start with saying, I am absolutely isekai trash and am totally going to finish this. This series likely does exactly what you want if you were drawn by the ridiculous light novel title. Especially if you like power-fantasies with OP MCs bringing modern tech into fantasy worlds like GATE. However, it was at about episode 8 that I started having a harder time entertaining this. If you get that far, you'll know why. Sometimes it doesn't even make sense how OP these ""prodigies"" are. At some point I can't tell if it's a parody like Cautious Hero or Konosuba, or if it's just really that bad and contrived. Either way it's mildly entertaining. Not something I'd go and recommend to any one ever, but if you're interested and have nothing better to watch go right on ahead, just don't expect any level of depth.",1

I wonder if Yanagi simply realized that the show he was tasked with making would be trash, so he tried to give it a soundtrack that wouldn't be similarly trash.I'm sorry, Yanagi.  You did the best you could with this dumpster fire.  All of the humor that is attempted falls flat, the music score sounds like it was taken from a pile of stock mp3s that the producer forced on the director, and the way each ""conflict"" is handled is wildly melodramatic.Every part of this show, from the visual design to the storyboarding indicates that a whole hell of alot of money was spent, yet compromises were made around every corner.",1
high-school-prodigies-have-it-easy-even-in-another-world,"This is seriously terrible.I honestly can't stomach to watch more than an episode, let alone the entire series. I have a few reasons as to why it's really bad, even though I don't think people would care about my opinion or even care to watch more than five minutes.The story is absolutely tragic. These seven young prodigies are thrust into another world after a plane crash in which all seven of the high schoolers survived the horrific crash. No word on the pilots though. When the main character wakes up to find himself in a bed with a bandage on his head, he suddenly remembers that he shouldn't be alive right now and immediately shows us a flashback. As the scene goes on, a girl who clearly has elongated ears walks into the room wearing fantasy style clothing, he is completely unaware of his surroundings. Absolutely does not question it one bit. That is - until the woman with the tail and ears walks into the room after a extremely weird fan service moment in which the elf girl chews up a bit of meat and feeds the main character like a bird.The characters are awful. One is a ninja journalist, an old-style female samurai, a entrepreneur that somehow has a hand in 30% of all trades in the world (Or Japan, can't remember) - a loli who is a great inventor, the main character is somehow the prime minister of Japan while still being in high school. The rest are extremely forgettable apparently.Honestly this show is a clear case of a corporation making an anime just to make a quick buck. I looked up this anime to find the author, I don't know who Riku Misora is nor do I care, if this anime is true to the manga, he needs to find another job.Really feels like Happinet told the author to email over a page loosely explaining the plot and manga style, then outsourcing it to an animation studio, allowing them to flex their animation skills despite the garbage story.I will also complain about the main characters eyes. I can't stand characters that look like that.There is a silver lining though. I found out what Isekai was because of this anime, and the animation is very beautiful. A pity.",1

This is another Isekai designed to be a cash cow, the art (as most other reviewers are saying) is the only good thing/ok thing about it. 0 character development, a generic cast that allows them to destroy any problem presented, which makes it so there is 0 risk to whatever they want to do.

No highschoolers would be as smart/great/strong as these kids are.And really? sword beats gun? maybe in 1 or 2 vs1, but 100 guns, unless all of them have storm-trooper like accuracy in shooting, that sword girl would have died in less than 1sec.A high schooler controlling 30% of global trades? even billionaires like Bill Gates don't control that much. It's 30% of all global trades, finances, commodities (foods, oil, raw ingredients), precious metal, etc2), this reeks of being written by a middle or high schoolers who doesn't understand how the world economy works...The others are also just so wrong. Completely and utterly wrong on so many levels.TLDR: don't bother with this trash and go for other anime that have values and good character development. (Kono oto tomare comes to mind this season, and kanata no Astra comes to mind from last season)",2
high-school-prodigies-have-it-easy-even-in-another-world,"This is the perfect example of a Chunibyo self-insert power fantasy. Zero sense whatsoever in the character creation, they simply are PERFECT in their respective trade (well pretty much everything actually). High-schoolers from Japan being the best in the world, one even somehow becoming Prime Minister of Japan? Like come on, even magic and fantasy is more believable than this. Also as a manga reader of this series, I must inform you that the characters never make any mistakes and flawlessly conquer the world. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WATCHING THIS.",2
high-school-prodigies-have-it-easy-even-in-another-world,"let's take not just one impossibly smart person who could never exist, but like seven of them. Then let's throw them in another world where they have magically brought everything they need with them. How does this even sound interesting enough for a studio to make it? This is the worst Isekai concept I've heard of and the first episode was pretty boring. Not only is this the worst Isekai this season, It's the worst Isekai I've watched. I'd much rather watch Konosuba's band of idiots fumble around than a group of uber-geniuses cakewalk all over the world.",1
high-school-prodigies-have-it-easy-even-in-another-world,"When I first saw this anime on MAL's Fall previews, I saw a PV of this anime. When I watched it, it wasn't really that good, yet I still had a hope for this anime.First episode comes around, oh no. I am left feeling utterly disappointed at this anime. I'll admit, I came in with low expectations. So anyways, I guess we have Danganronpa in an Isekai. You have ultimate doctor, ultimate magician, ultimate journalist, ultimate engineer, ultimate economist, ultimate swordsman, and the ultimate... prime minister? Anyways, each of these characters lack any personality at all and are all bland. I can't help but absolutely just want to sit in a corner over watching this. I am extremely hoping this gets better in the next few episodes.",2
high-school-prodigies-have-it-easy-even-in-another-world,"I've been interested since episode one! They piled on character arcs effectively each episode leading to an important event which made it easier for the audience to relate to and form a connection with each character. The anime definitely has its quirks but I think that adds to the fun and entertainment value of the show, i'm not a fan of harem anime but I think because of how painfully obvious it is whenever there's a fan-service setting they don't lose too many points in my book since you know what to expect and it's not an Extremely constant thing throughout the show like it is for others. I suppose the reason I didn't give it 5 stars was on two not so major points, Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideone being that they made it a point to use biodegradable and Eco-friendly methods (the bottles in episode 12 for example) yet they chose to go down a path of burning fossil fuels in early episodes and the use of the nuke wouldn't have been my go-to concept for attempting to obliterate a singular enemy where there could've been innocent villages nearby it was a slightly ironic approach in my opinion, the enemy could use that Intel and nuke event against them in the futureSpoiler Alert! Click to show or hideSuppose there's the earlier scene where running next to a missile got quite ridiculous to handle but I found it quite humorous so I didn't mind too much, I suppose it follows a similar style throughout most of the 'boss battles' though, so it's expected by now12/12 episodes watched, keep it up looking forward to watching the rest~",2
high-school-prodigies-have-it-easy-even-in-another-world,"Most would probably give this series a hard time due to how our main characters are mary sues from the get-go; in fact, quite a few people already have.  True, that does make for a rather uninteresting series when it relies on narrative tension and external conflict to draw in its viewers, however, there exists multiple series that prove that this isn't an inherently bad thing.  While I haven't watched it, One-Punch Man has gone on to critical acclaim, for example.  While I haven't heard of them, I'm sure there are numerous other series proving this as well.  A show's quality is dependent on its execution, not its premise.A shame, then, because the execution is lacking at best.  I don’t want to be too harsh on this show, because it does get better after episode 4, but that’s past the point most would have dropped it.  That said, I can still find traces of its initial problems in the later episodes.If the show wasn't going to build itself on external conflict, it should have built itself on internal conflict.  It should have focused on the dynamics between these characters, their reactions to getting thrust into another world, their feelings towards each other.  For instance, Akatsuki is the world's greatest magician (Read, illusionist), and Shinobu is the world's greatest journalist and ninja.  There could have been a bit of a rivalry between these two because she keeps seeing through his illusions.  It would have led to an interesting character dynamic.  Outside of accomplishing a goal, however, they hardly even acknowledge each other’s existence.  I don’t even think they’ve spoken one word to each other.  Instead, the only two characters who have a more complicated dynamic then ‘we’re in this together’ are Ringo and Tsukasa, which we’ll get to later.They also could have done a thing where, after defeating a giant monster, Aoi's sword breaks.  It would have served to remind them - and by extension us - that despite this girl being an extraordinary swordswoman, her sword is extra ordinary.  Or at least it is until Ringo makes a better one.They bring up the fact that the plane they arrived in had an experimental nuclear core powering it; with this, I have two ideas.  The first idea is that the more hot-headed and confrontational members of the group assume Ringo is responsible for them being trapped in the new world, which could lead to an interesting internal conflict until Tsukasa finally convinces them they were summoned by that world's god.  The second idea is to have the reactor threaten to melt-down occasionally, forcing Ringo to manually fix it, slowing her progress until she can find a more permanent solution.  Once again, she might be extraordinary, but her materials and tools aren't.  She’s also just relegated to building stuff offscreen for the group, which is a shame because the writer could have had her MacGyver her way out of most situations.Going back to Akatsuki for a minute, the idea of an illusionist getting trapped in a world with actual magic is nothing new, and it can be used for great effect.  Just look at Oz: The Great and Powerful.  However, they never explain how he does his tricks, and they make them over the top impossible and expecting you to believe it because 'He's the world's best magician.' Yeah, sorry, but they're called 'magic tricks' because they trick people into thinking their magic when they're really just sleight of hand and misdirection.  Masato managed to conquer an entire monopoly with a basic revenue-sharing model, so you have to wonder why this show wouldn’t include at least one scene of a smoke machine.Speaking of Masato, in the third episode, the show tries to establish Masato is a really kind and stand-up guy when he helps a girl get out of slavery and takes her on as his apprentice.  But it unironically undercuts it by not only having him pay the slavers in full, but also by paying them a hundred times what she's worth, ensuring that not only can that business continue, but thrive.  If anyone listened to what people said about Master of Ragnarok, they clearly took the wrong message.  A scene that establishes what they wanted better is when he managed to crush a monopoly, only to let the company continue to exist as he thought a monopoly, no matter who ran it, was a bad thing.  While I agree with that mentality, I don’t think it’s going to last long.  After he so thoroughly destroyed the other company’s revenue and trust, I highly doubt it’s going to last long now that Masato’s in town whether he likes it or not.  That would have been interesting to explore, the idea that he’s too good for his own good and can’t keep any competition around because of it, but if the show did that, I wouldn’t be suggesting it, now would I?Also, I don’t care how smart the guy is, a bog-standard revenue sharing plan should not have allowed him to topple a monopoly.  His competition should have been putting him through hell.  Just look at how Big Oil sabotaged their competition before we decided monopolies were bad things.  Masato didn’t succeed because he was competent, he succeeded because his competition was incompetent.The biggest crime here, however, is that these characters have no character.  As previously stated, there are seven prodigies, however there only seems to be enough personally for one, so they kinda have to share.  They're just a specialization meant to help move the plot along.  They're plot devices at best.  That would be acceptable if they were side-characters, but this is the main group we're talking about here.  While I haven't watched it, One-Punch Man most likely worked because it focused on the character, not the struggle.  Here though, not only is there no struggle, but there also isn’t character.  Akatsuki seems to have the most personality of the group, but it isn’t much.  There’s a brief moment in episode 4 where Akatsuki was taken aback by all the bloodshed his group was causing and froze up for a minute, but like I said, it’s a brief moment.  He’s also the most shaken by waking up in another world, but for the wrong reason.  He’s more afraid of how everyone has anime tails and ears than anything else.  This would have been funny if they pointed out how stupid he was, but they don’t.    Even if he was the best character, 1/7 is still a failing grade.Actually, I tell a lie, Keine also has a noteworthy personality, but only in the sense that it’s utterly abhorrent.  Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideShe’s a complete psychopath who’s willing to lobotomize her enemies at a moment’s notice and suggestions that Rinko rapes Tsukasa to ‘get closer to him.’  I get that Comedic Sociopath is a common thing that can be done very well, but the problem is that she’s exceptionally good at hiding it.  There are never any moments where people call her out for how morally bankrupt she is, and she only suggests something immoral when it’s a bridge too far once.  Ironically, despite hating god for making humans so frail, she’s the type of person who proves that there is no god.For the most part, these characters just move from one plot point to the next without any sort of meaningful interaction with pretty much anyone.Having said that, the show doesn’t fair all too well when it focuses on specific characters.  Episode ten reveals why Ringo has a crush on Tsukasa, and boy is it poorly written:  Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideWhen they were still in high school, Tsukasa kept bringing her things to fix.  When she decided she wanted to focus on her own inventions instead of repairing, she discovered he was bringing her those things from some sort of shop or something without telling her.  For some reason, this gets her to fall for him becasue he was always nice to her about it and even took her declining to fix things with a smile.  Maybe it's just my cynical perspective on things, but it looked more like he was taking advantage of her kindness and talents to make a profit.  Given how Ringo’s mother abandoned her due to the girl being too smart and accomplished for her liking, you’d think Ringo would be more offended than she is flattered.Another big problem is that it seems to be taking itself way too seriously.  You have a group of kids who are all the absolute best examples of their profession, not just for their age, but for their world, transported to a fantasy world.  This should be an absurdist comedy of sorts.  Have Ringo create a fully functional recreation of the Iron Man armor in a cave with a paperclip and some soda cans.  Have Aoi fight off a giant monster with a toy sword.  Have Keine cure cancer or even death.  If you’re going to make the story this easy for them, you could at least have fun with it.  Instead, it's trying to weave some grand tale about these kids changing an entire world, and it's trying to do so seriously – or at least as seriously as an anime can get.But like I said, it did get better after episode 4.  When the actual plot got started, I found I had an easier time watching these episodes.  It’s an okay enough show, but that’s all it is.",1
high-school-prodigies-have-it-easy-even-in-another-world,"Don't really know why some people have given 1 star review to the show, personally I found quite interesting and entertaining. The characters are lovable and the plot is quite unique, at times it might feel that the characters are overpowered (at least academically) but it's part of the premise of the story so I didn't really pay no attention to that and instead focused on the story itself so all and all I would say watch it and judge by yourself, I believe you will enjoy it.",1
high-school-prodigies-have-it-easy-even-in-another-world,"This anime is if you started a Civ game on easy and went directly for the Giant Death Robots. These high-schoolers just build god damn rail guns and missiles and they're fighting against soldiers with swords and shields. That doesn't mean its a bad anime. In fact, I find it very entertaining. Just watch it for what it is and don't go into it expecting the next masterpiece.Story 3/5: The premise is a pretty generic isekai with some kind of twist. Basically take Danganronpa but instead of them being locked in a school, they're in an Isekai. You have the leader, the business man, the samurai, the ninja, the doctor, the wizard, the techy and throw in an elf for good measure. They get transported mysteriously into this fantasy world and have to find a way back home. While they're there, they overthrow a local noble and start bringing on the democracy, AMERICA-STYLE. Armed with their rail guns and missile defense systems, they begin a revolution to overthrow the feudal society. The plot is stupid, but the anime embraces the stupidity to make it at least entertaining. Characters 2/5: No character is developed particularly well except for maybe the leader, Mikogami Tsukasa who currently is the only one who has a legitimate backstory as to why he became ""The Politician"". Character tropes are pretty standard and none of them are particularly well refined but they're ok I guess. The issue with the character development though is similar to what happened in the Slime Isekai. There is no challenge for the characters. The lack of challenge makes character development hard to build because there's nothing pushing them to be better. They are already so overpowered that there is no character complexity, or inner turmoil, or drama. Everything goes hunky dory and that leaves the characters relatively 2 dimensional.Art/Animation 3/5: Decent art and animation. Character designs are pretty standard but are animated well enough. The magic is pretty well animated and the battles are done pretty well. There is a bit of clunkiness with the CG, especially for the higher tech weapons they use but it's not that bad.Sound 3/5: Intro song is very skippable. No soundtrack really stood out to me, but it wasn't exactly bad. It fit the situations well but none of them really had that majestic amazing sound like its really building to something amazing. The upbeat opening fits the silliness of the anime. Ending song is pretty nice. Entertainment 4/5: I literally burst into laughter as I was writing this review. It's so stupid, but its so fun also. Like there's nothing wrong with playing Civ on easy mode. It's fun to just roll out giant death robots and wreck everyone. Plus we got a hot elf girl. Minus points for the ugly bastard in episode 4. Like why does this even exist in anime. Who likes watching that? I don't need to see that Pot of Greed face in anything outside of a Yu-Gi-Oh card. Overall 3/5: It's worth the watch if you want to watch something that you don't really have to care about. You don't really need to think when watching this anime. It's just entertainment. Also, don't take it too seriously. At one point the samurai girl manually guides a missile onto a target. They're not making Casablanca.",5
high-school-prodigies-have-it-easy-even-in-another-world,"Could have been more interesting if it wasn't trying to subvert, included, and exceed all existing tropes at once.Too many supposed ""main"" characters prevent adequate for them all even the one that is supposed to be the protagonist among the main characters leaving even less room for the also too large cast of secondary and other supporting characters.Most of the problems with the show overall stem from this single issue. I'd rather a only a couple or even a single super-genius combat trained protagonist as the central focus than trying to play them all up.Could say more but I'm already past beating a dead horse for only one issue I have with it.",3
high-school-prodigies-have-it-easy-even-in-another-world,"TL:DR - OK filler but not for those with high standards.This review is being offered by someone who has only recently gotten back into watching anime after 4-5 years, and has watched up to the expected half-way point of the season.Overall the animation is good, VA is better than some others, and the concept of ""drag a medieval society into the Information Age"" is one that could be done well...but not so much here. Dr Stone is a better example of the concept from a different set of starting conditions which make it hard to truly compare.The world and lore itself has promise, but hard to tell when looking through the lens of the show as it stands.As many of the reviews point out, the characters are the weak point. While there is some development by Ep7, the ""All Teen All l337"" lineup of 7...SEVEN!!! main characters doesn't work that well.Too many things are hand-waved as ""Oh this genius did all this offscreen"" which is not satisfying. And really there is 1 main character slot and 4 true supporting character slots that get filled each episode.If it was me, I'd have one or two people dropped into the world, let things play out, and have others summoned in over the course of the first 6 episodes, with a more age diverse and not so OP cast...but that would defeat the premise of this show.",3

high-school-prodigies-have-it-easy-even-in-another-world,I've only gotten through 2 episodes of this show and I gotta say this show is lame for the same reasons that pretty much everyone else listed. The show has pretty much no substance as it's just people who were already on top of the world are teleported to a different world where they continue to be on top throughout without putting in very much effort at all. It takes away everything that makes a show good. With no real struggle or set goal in mind the show just feels lazy as everyone just does whatever they want and it works out as well as it can get because the show sets it up to be that way.,5
high-school-prodigies-have-it-easy-even-in-another-world,"this isn't the absolute worst but by no means is it any good. it's better than the other isekais available on crunchyroll this year (wise man's grandchild, isekai cheat magician) but still manages to be boring and one note. MCs are all completely OP from the get-go, no power training arc or character development or progression. they dont get powers from a god or anything, they were just already super high-spec before even coming to the new world. also, what's the deal with their obsession with mayonnaise? these medieval peasants act like eating mayo is a near orgasmic experience and after one taste they abandon all previously held beliefs and (literally) convert to the religion that offers them free sandwich spread.",1

The only character whose name I know is not his actual name, unless his parents hated him, (""merchant"" for those wondering). They should have had a few less high school prodigies go to this world, because I feel like all of them are paper cutouts that would shred if the slightest breeze came by.I gave the show a chance, but ep 5 was just too dumb, I would need to lobotomize my self to keep watching this show at this point. I mean did they copy the character model of the elf for Dr. Green-hair? I'm the opposite of religious and even I found this episode reductive and idiotic on the topic. And the more a Japanese prime minister who is a child talks about liberty and freedom for all types of people, the more I choke on things I'm eating and drinking from the irony. Oh and the reaction of the little magician kid about finding out there was real magic in Ep1 was ridiculous, because apparently fake show-magic is stronger and more impressive then REAL magic. It would be different if his character was fleshed out even for a minute or two, like explaining that a bunch of his equipment was in the plane crash or that genius girl created cloaky drones for him to use, anything. At least give us a flipping hand-wave.I'm a doctor, not a miracle worker. This show is not worth the time.",1
high-school-prodigies-have-it-easy-even-in-another-world,"I gave this show 3.5 episodes before I got so bored with it that I dropped it. Any problem the MCs, who are all just superhuman at their respective fields even though they're only high school students, ran in to was resolved so laughably easily that there was no dramatic tension.Even worse than that, it just wasn't interesting. I'll watch a show with a trash plot if it's fun, but this just failed to deliver its premise in a way I found enjoyable or interesting. I think I actually would prefer to watch In Another World with my Smartphone again, and that one had a boringly-OP main character as well.",2
high-school-prodigies-have-it-easy-even-in-another-world,"3⭐️- Watching the first episode it's your usual op isekai but they're actually prodigies from earth which is good because the whole isekai genre was all about powers from no explanation. Seven high school geniuses in an isekai world would be interesting as each of them and their skills will help the world around them to evolve and advance thanks to their  superior intelligence in a certain field.For the least part it's got seven unique characters with completely different abilities however the fact that in episode 1 tech girl has a portable nuclear reactor, it's going a bit too fast.Promising but expect nothing less of your average isekai4⭐️- EDIT1: ok so after watching the second episode i can sense that its not based around op magic power and yes, i know that in ep1 they mentioned people and magic and stuff. Besides if they were to have like a real fight i can just see the ninja girl being a fighter, the tech girl makes like weapons and stuff, journalist girl gathers intel or something, etc. They all are experts in their own field and I'm surprised seeing an isekai where they haven't go all out on the magic ) in ep2. Looks like they tried to create a isekai that isn't solely power-magic-orientated, and by filling that hole with intelligence is a good approachNice work",1

But its actually kind of funny, even with how typical it is. second episode picks it up and we get into money making, which i really enjoyed and hope they capitalize on actually going into forming a capitalist economy. if they focus on politics mostly i think it will be interesting and kind of fresh.Only 2 episodes out so far. IMO finish the second ep, if you dont like it you wont like it later either is my guess.",1
high-school-prodigies-have-it-easy-even-in-another-world,"The opening of the 1st episode was kinda weird for me. I didn’t like how they introduced all of the characters in one go.

It shows a bit of the merchants character but not too much (he’s cool as well). This genre was quite overused for me but the concept is really good. Can’t wait for the next episodes.",1

It's not gold, for sure, but it's OK. Worth watching if you have nothing better to do. The characters are overpowered but they aren't mary sues (they are just really good at one particular thing and OK at everything else, at least in concept). It's entertaining if not very deep.",1
high-school-prodigies-have-it-easy-even-in-another-world,"Edit: Two episodes in I think they may have a decent pace going on. I won't drop it because I know some of what happens, but I fear that many will. The isekai market is saturated and this series is definitely peak OP isekai. The animation and the vosice cast do a great job though.I was reading this manga for a while and I might go back to it. It's basically peak OP isekai. All of the characters are amazing at their specialty. When they go to the other world, they maintain their abilities and have the added bonus of having access to OP tech, because of how they enter the world. They don't do the standard ""learn to use our powers"" thing, because there is no need. If you want that sorry, it's not for you.If this follows the manga, you can look forward to character building in the form of interpersonal relationships and intrapersonal conflicts. The politician has some quirks I found interesting and I saw them becoming major issues and drivers of plot. Add in what seems like it might become a pretty messy love polygon and it could make for something interesting. The one thing that will definitely hurt this series, though, is if they take it at the same pace as the source material. The reason I stopped reading was to let it continue out some more, because the chapters could draaaaaaag. These are initial thoughts. I will amend after I watch the first episode.",3

high-school-prodigies-have-it-easy-even-in-another-world,"EDIT My initial impressions after episode 1 were spot on. And the guess that they'll need an army by the end of the month was true. At least the master merchant is throwing every FTC violation in the book at the locals. Meanwhile miss Master surgeon ""repairs organs"" and restarts a heart before brain death. That's less than 5 minutes by the way. The victim had a pierced colon too, treated without any antibiotics! Amazing! Look, if you don't know anything about the real world, maybe you can make it through an episode, I could barely contain myself after the aluminum shovels. You know those crappy snow shovels which bend on packed snow? That's what the master engineer made for the villagers to dig dirt with. ""But dhristo! They are aluminum alloy!"" Yes, so are those cheap ones, aluminum sucks for shovels! As the master diplomat asks her, ""you are refining aluminum already?"" YOU HAVE A 737 WORTH OF ALUMINUM AND OTHER EXOTIC METALS ALREADY! Why does she need to refine ANY, just melt it down and forge? She should be forging guns by now... But I guess you don't need them since samurai lady can carry 4 ton boulders above her head bare handed. She can simply shot put like a cannon, grape shot will be a challenge, but I think she'll manage. This writer has done no research, doesn't care if anything is even close to realistic, and this makes the characters seem stupid while simultaneously succeeding at Herculean tasks. Master diplomat has already let everyone create political gaffes all over the place. Master surgeon is literally a goddess who doesn't need sanitary conditions or antibiotics to cure. Master scientist doesn't know how to reforge or recycle aluminum from a jetliner, and made shovels out of aluminum not steel. Master businessman is committing fraud. And the intelligence ninja didn't know an elite armored battalion was moving on the village. Who is the prodigy? It seems the writer simply writes in the cool stuff and then a bad thing for ""drama"". I'm kind of invested now, but if you aren't, better give this a pass. I'm taking back my mercy star. This is trash.Initial impressions bellow--------------------------------------------------------------------------This is an episode one review, so the show is given leniency the other reviews have shrugged away from. I like the ""isekai"" format more than the pure fantasy or alternate history formats. It usually has more expansive answer to ""what if...?"" Like in Overlord, ""what if you were stranded in a world full of NPCs (the humans) you cared little for?"" Pretty lonely existence for Ains, isn't it? Or in How not to Summon a Demon Lord, ""what if you were in another world without any social skills?"" Yeah, Diablo gets to do some pretty pervy things, but he's constantly under huge pressure. If you were even a little socially awkward, you do feel for the guy. In Tanya the Evil we get an office worker to not only fight a war, but also an entity with near limitless power. Can't be a fun time, even with Tanya's extra oomph. So, what does this anime offer? It's a group of 7, so they're not lonely. They are all exceptionally outgoing, so they aren't socially awkward. There is no war that they have to fight, there may be a war, but they aren't forced into it. There isn't a God pestering them, and they weren't summoned by some king to fight some sort of wave. There is a bad dragon, but that can't be too bad of an enemy if the story teller got laughed at.Oh, there's a nuclear reactor at their disposal. You get me one of those and dirt, I'll give you guns in a week, m777 howitzers without the electronics in a month, with the electronics in 6-7 months, and I'm just an engineer who hasn't built his own space lab. I'd be building main battle tanks in a year, tops. Who's gonna stop me? Oh, they do have the engineer in the pink dress on the cover. She better build a furnace and a lathe within the week or I'm calling Dr. Stone to ridicule her back into orbit.They had the master politician create a national incident and attempt to cover it up, poorly, on his very first encounter with a corrupt soldier. Something tells me he's not gonna do well unless engineer girl manages to procure him the equivalent of the USA armed forces by next month. So he better get to recruiting, I hope the master merchant can get him the budget he'd need for salaries, or the master magician Prince will have to pull them out of his...hat? What's an illusionist doing here? They couldn't fit in a physicist? Does the science girl do everything? Math, physics, engineering, biology, chemistry...? OK, I get it, prodigy, Dr. Stone does it, so why not? I don't like Dr. Stone either, arrogant p.... Anyway.This show has no appealing characters. We have overpowered people, who by all accounts were simply born that way, start trouble in another world. I don't know where the other reviewers got, ""we'll take your women, because we're better"" or ""elitism"" from, but I get the dislike of the characters. They are Mary Sues and quite annoying, especially ninja and samurai girls. I get taking out 2 guys each without armor, but four fully armored soldiers going down without a sound of struggle or hits, is too much. I get it, they are OP, but how do you knock out someone in a full helmet without making noise? Come on show! I'm not asking for reality, but at least enough for me to suspend disbelief ? A little bit? 90 pound girls taking down trained veterans, cool, I'll buy it, make the armor ding a bit? Bop? No? Nothing? OK, bye bye silly show.",1
high-school-prodigies-have-it-easy-even-in-another-world,"Could be interesting take on the tad overcrowded Isekai genre, a group of seven prodigies instead of the sole protagonist. Based on first episode it is okay, doesn't seem to take any risks with our super genius High Schoolers thrust into a medieval fantasy world. I'm hoping there will some interesting plot twists and some badly needed characterization (as it stands our Heroes are walking caricatures). It reminds ""Astra Lost in Space"", except this anime give the impression of being a lot more shallow. For what it is, it's fine, a nice way to wile away 24 minutes without much conflict or 'easy' viewing.",1
high-school-prodigies-have-it-easy-even-in-another-world,"Honestly is not bad as many one star people rated as. Though the starting episode actually bland but is well animated and directed. They were able to setup what they needed. Also keep in mind this is a work of fiction and fantasy, so things can be whatever the author write. It seem to me people are disliking this story was because of the absurd profession these kids are at a young age. I agree, however even irl thing like this can still happen; for example, the recent 9 years old electrical engineer graduate! I actually enjoy the story so far and would recommend those who enjoy isekai and management story. 5 stars for now!",2
high-school-prodigies-have-it-easy-even-in-another-world,"We know they're op and prodigies, it literally tells us so, so why is everyone throwing fits? I didn't watch this anime until today because of the reviews, but it's actually pretty good and refreshing. The way they're trying to fix the place up and bring freedom to the people kinda reminds me of 'That Time I Got Reincarnated To A Slime', in that it's nice to watch them start from the beginning, then work their way up to make the town a better place",4
high-school-prodigies-have-it-easy-even-in-another-world,"People getting upset that the characters in the anime having it too easy just makes me laugh. y'all didnt read the title of the anime huh. High school prodigies have it EASY. This is just something to mindlessly enjoy. Kick back and relax your shoulders, relax your jaw, BREATHE. How about you all take it easy?Despite all that, as I said, if you're looking for some easy going, reformative and op characters, then you're at the right place.If you're looking for some painstakingly serious, end of the world threats, then look elsewhere. It's all in the title.",3
high-school-prodigies-have-it-easy-even-in-another-world,"Unlike other isekai anime out there who has whiny, woe-is-me, weak, dumb, goody-two-shoes protagonists, the main characters in this anime are strong-willed, can adopt to new environment, talented and can make decisions quickly (living up to their prodigy title, of course) also kind-hearted but bad-asses. Each of the characters might have sad pasts but i like how they choose to either set it aside or learn from it instead of living in constant self-pity like most anime characters do. They try their best to help the inhabitants; sharing their knowledge and showing them ways to make their lives better and daily lives easier whilst teaching them how not to be pushed around by the wealthy and powerful. This is how it should be. Please don't change it. Don't mind the haters.",3
high-school-prodigies-have-it-easy-even-in-another-world,"None of the characters have any real development or introduction, nor any given motivation for their goals. I can deal with powerfantasy isekai, as overdone as it is, but 7 cardboard cutouts going around being the supergreatest at everything forever isn't a fun watch. What exceptionally little personality the characters display is nothing but grating and annoying. There's zero explanation for how or why they're the best at their given field, it just is. One kid can fly and levitate his decapitated head. This is never explained, even slightly. That's actually sumarized the anime pretty well. It's never explained, even slightly. Why do they want to return to earth? No explanation. Why can a highschooler do complicated surgeries? No reason. And to top it off, they put gratuitous fanservice directly next to the fattest most disgusting slob in the show. I don't even mind elf jiggles, but to cut between an elfs breasts and a fat pigs face is just an extreme display of bad taste, and entirely out of place in an anime about highschool kids.",3
high-school-prodigies-have-it-easy-even-in-another-world,"I think this show makes up for the typical genre tropes with the abundance of humor. Not every isekai show is supposed to be The Rising of the Shield Hero or Saga of Tanya the Evil, sometimes a show just has to go off the deep end and be almost a parody of a genre, and this show delivers the goods. If you desire a good natured funny isekai show, then this is it. It is absurdly humorous in a parody kinda way and good natured.",5
high-school-prodigies-have-it-easy-even-in-another-world,"Many of the bad reviews here are after 1-2 episodes. The first episode did itself no favors with some pretty eye rollingly blatant fan service right away. I was also really tempted not to continue.However, by the third episode, it began to take on a very Log Horizon feel. Of course the main characters seem to easily overcome everything, but then we all love One Punch Man, and he literally doesn’t even try, so I think we can cut these guys some slack. Each character has their own unique talents, and by the most current episode, we start to see those talents DO have their own burdens. It takes several episodes, but you begin to see the other dimensions of several of the characters.Their overall mission also reminds me a bit of Shield Hero, in that they are ultimately poised to be saviors. I find it really interesting how they decide to go about it, and again it reminds me of Log Horizon, which I really enjoyed.In short, some people judged harshly very fast, and I think the anime needs a second look. Some anime are slow to build. They can’t all be strong out of the gate like Sword Art Online... then again most will remember how hard that one crashed and burned about 12 episodes in. This one may also shape up poorly, but I’m willing to watch til the end.",3
high-school-prodigies-have-it-easy-even-in-another-world,"Seems like people are over reacting a bit, I understand the genre is getting to saturated with this kind of stuff but it's honestly not that bad. Though I absolutely hate the illusionist character since what he does might as well be magic. I find it stupid to rag on the 1D characters since I wasn't expecting them to be complicated with a lot of good backstory. I do think this anime as a whole could be improved but the idea of this pack of mary sues entering another world is interesting enough for me which is why I'm giving it an average score. Good concept, there's good scenes, but the writing can be a bit too bland.",3
high-school-prodigies-have-it-easy-even-in-another-world,This is definitely somewhat different if compared to other anime. Many say that the missing sense of real danger due to the overpowered main characters renders this show boring and I could agree to that if not for one thing.This show seems not to be build around a plot of danger but one of builiding. In other words this anime´s plot is not about the characters overcoming a certain challenge but them building a new world within this fantasy world. If you like such storys this anime is certainly worth a look. But if you want to see a challenge and powerful villains with complex story´s then you should probably spend your time with something more productive ;).,3
high-school-prodigies-have-it-easy-even-in-another-world,"Isekai anime just keeps getting worse, and High School Prodigies Have It Easy In Another World is proof of that. There are multiple aspects of the story that I have major problems with. First of all, the protagonist is one of the most generic characters I have seen in an anime. Not only is he a politician in his high-school days, he is able to get all the ladies. The females in this show had the potential to easily become top tier waifus, but the show has messed all of them up as new episodes are released. I do not understand why this anime is as popular as it is, nor can I even begin to comprehend why people would actually enjoy this. If it were possible, I would give this show a 0\5.",3
naruto,"I only post reviews for shows I have watched completely to the last episode and I will never recommend an anime to every person because frankly, what I like may not be the same for another person. People who might enjoy this anime are fans of battle-heavy series.Plot development : Right from the beginning we know what the entire series is about: a boy who wants to be the Hokage, or the best ninja in his village. The entire show, therefore, focuses on his development from ""drop out"" status to a ninja worthy of respect. Plot wise, the first few episodes were very slow, but is probably necessary because of the uniqueness of this anime. You are literally brought in to a whole new world and very appropriately, you are slowly introduced to what Konoha is like. Then as Naruto gains experience, he leaves the village and we learn along with him what the world of Naruto is like from his missions and journeys. As a series, Naruto truly is a series about Naruto growing up and gives audiences a glimpse into this amazingly well conceived world. The sequel, Naruto: Shippuuden develops upon the plots in Naruto and like all kids who grow up, they discover that the world isn't as bright as they once thought. This is highly reflected in the higher amounts of bloodshed, pains and sorrow in this sequel. But that's for a different review. On another note, I'm glad there is little fillers compared to Shippuuden.Character development : I would argue that Naruto has one of the best ""child development"" plots I have ever read or seen. I say this because Naruto as a character is very multilayered. He can be smiles and pranks, yet sorrowful and lonely in the next. His determination is simply admirable and I think it's because of these qualities that he is able to relate to and act as a catalyst that changes others. Hyuuga Neji is probably the best example. From fate-obsessed arrogant prodigy, we see an almost 180 degrees change to a more humble self-driven, still somewhat arrogant boy. Frankly, Naruto's actions constantly surprise his peers, teachers, and readers. But what still surprises me about him is his sincerity in his actions and words.Artwork : I personally prefer the artwork in the manga. At times when manga are made into anime, they are ""cleaner"" and lack the gruffness that can only be seen in the manga. Despite this, I still really enjoy the swirl designs that is almost ubiquitous in the world of Naruto. As a fantasy ninja story, all the bright colors is just like a kid's fairy tale, which is very appropriate. I think the clothing designs are ok, but what I truly love in terms of artwork are the designs and layouts of the villages, Konoha especially since it is shown the most often. Music : I like a few opening and ending themes, but I think the in-series music takes the cake here. Very rarely will you have a mainstream show with good in-series music and most have simply unimpressive scores and theme songs, but Naruto is surprisingly refreshing. Not only are the scores pleasant and fit the occasion, but the instruments and percussions used are the instruments I would imagine to exist in Naruto.Originality : In terms of artwork and music, this is as original as it gets. However, in terms of plot and character development, it is sometimes archetypical since the protagonist will and does end up being a praise worthy person through n number of trials. However, the organization and planning that goes into the trials that Naruto has to face is unlike any other protagonist. Other anime treat friendship as if they were made of titanium and gold once forged, but I really like how this series shows how strong, weak and most importantly, how rare friendship truly is. Friends can so easily become acquaintances and then strangers and trying to rekindle a friendship is always harder than making a new one. Score : 5/5 I don't normally give 5 stars and when I do, it's when I truly believe that the anime or manga is simply a masterpiece.",4.5
naruto,"Naruto, is a series about a boy who takes on challenges for himself. He has hopes and dreams of becoming his village's leader. Overall, Naruto has its ups and downs. The story line is deep, with a plot that follows the manga. Naruto also has several filler arcs which lead away from the main plot. The music is great, and matches up with scenes well. The characters of Naruto, are well thought out.. they all have details about them and are interesting to watch. Animation is excellent. Fights are very detailed, you know how far away the characters are, and there are great camera angles.This series has gone on for along time and is really popular, If you don't know what Naruto is your missing out.Naruto is a great anime series that you should defintly consider watching",5
naruto,"Naruto is a great anime.I grew up watching Naruto ever since I was 13 years old and now I'm 23. It was my first anime along with One Piece, both of which brought me to other animes. It is a very special anime that is full of life lessons, one that taught me a lot ever since I started watching it. Naruto is a series full of action, fights, feels, friendship, beliefs, and most importantly, BONDS, and I grew up attached to these points and more to the characters.Ever since it started, it always focused on the power and the importance of believing in one's self. The anime is a great storyteller, from it's darkest backgrounds to it's cool developments until the end. It also has a lot of amazing and interesting characters that feel so realistic.My complaints would be something like some episodes with very low quality animation, and some fillers that were bad or that killed the hype of the canon parts. Other than that, the story, the characters' developments and the characters themselves are great, the original soundtracks are even greater, among the best I've heard.",5
naruto,"To me, Naruto is the most emotional, unpredictable plot their is in the anime universe. Naruto mostly appeals to me because of all its multiple conflicts to be solved in the story, a favorite being how team seven turned out almost exactly like Tsunade, Jiraya, and Orochimaru (Relationship wise). The un-ordinary and original system of fighting styles and clans the characters contain themselves to are another feature that grabs my attention but the thing i like the best is  all the emotion expressed by the characters and the captivation this brings to the viewer. This is mostly achieved by this Anime containing a feature that a lot of old American comics and anime have seemed to avoided: both good people and bad people die. It makes you get emotionally evolved with how every one of the individual characters are thinking instead of just your favorite hero. The story of Naruto is highly unpredictable, making more and more people (especially myself) become attached to the series and the characters that make it up.",5
naruto,"Best stories and characters of any anime I've ever seen. The narrative creates a real emotional connection with the people in the stories. Everything progresses clearly and with continuity. It's embarrassing, but these stories often bring a tear to my eye.Excellent music, too!Fillers are ok at times but frequently pretty lame and hamper the story's smooth progression. A necessary evil, I guess.",5
naruto,"Given the voracity of the backlash against the “not-so-bad” rating that Naruto received upon initial viewing by a fellow reviewer, I am certain that many readers eagerly anticipate a reviewer that, upon broader viewing (or even being of dissimilar gender from the original critic), will vindicate their pristine opinion of this title. Unfortunately you, the reader, are stuck with me. While I don’t think poorly of this title by any stretch of the imagination, the buzz pervading Naruto is plainly more hype than substance.So where does the hype begin you ask? Right off the bat. From the very beginning of episode one this title more or less pronounces itself to be of the cookie-cutter Shonen Jump variety, and only a somewhat above average one at that. The character for which the show is named, Naruto, is quickly introduced, and even before the end of the first episode the viewer is completely aware of the ultimate direction of the plot: Naruto will someday become the strongest ninja of his village and receive the highly coveted title of Hokage. But knowing the end of the plotline isn’t as much of a killjoy as one would expect. It is the ride that counts after all. However, in the case of Naruto the ride is tantamount to that of an old, wooden roller coaster: sometimes thrilling and often nostalgic, yet still quite a bit rickety and easily outdone in terms of excitement and quality.The characters, like the plot, are mostly OK while being admittedly cliched. Uzumaki Naruto, our primary character, is much like the leads of many of the most popular fight-styled anime. Like Goku (of Dragon Ball fame), Naruto is headstrong, motivated (mostly to become stronger), and cares deeply about his comrades. Like Yuusuke (of Yu Yu Hakusho fame), Naruto is rambunctious, brash, and a bit of a slacker. Despite his being particularly formulaic, Naruto at least combines the finer qualities of his predecessors. Such can not be said of his archrival Sasuke, a figure for whom blandness knows no depth. In fact, many of the characters fall somewhere in-between Sasuke’s blandness and Naruto’s charisma and coolness. You will come to care for the cast of Naruto for sure, just not at any deep or meaningful level.The animation, much like the characterization and plotting, is spotty. At times great while at other times shoddy, the quality of the animation here lacks any real consistency. During the arcs in which the animation is still on the minds of the animators, the viewer is treated to a fluid frame-rate and artistic renderings that leave little to be desired on the part of fans of the manga. Nevertheless, when the animation is bad it is painful. At these times the once faithful renderings degrade to craptastic levels. It is as if you can feel the framerates slipping before your very eyes. Like most aspects thus far examined, the animation of Naruto is a mixed bag indeed.It is perhaps a bit unfair though to judge a fight/action anime based upon factors such as characterization and plotting. True to its genre, it is in fight/action scenes that Naruto receives is highest accolades, though that isn’t saying a whole hell of a lot. Despite very wide employment, the fight scenes manage to remain remarkably fresh. With such a large extended cast, invigorating and unique fighting styles/techniques manage to continuously infuse action sets with life. Additionally, the background music manages to add some tension to these scenes quite effectively. There are some negative aspects to the action sets however. One is the overemployment of certain special techniques, particularly Naruto’s Shadow Clone technique, a move in which he creates multiple clones of himself. When a character uses the same move over and over and over and . . . well, things get bland and repetitive. Another detriment is that the sheer number of fights impedes the potency of plotting. Still, the combat stages are pretty intense and there are plenty of scenes for action fans to get pumped about.How one feels about Naruto probably depends, in good part, on their anime viewing mileage. As a person that has been watching anime for a decade and a half, there isn’t too much here that I haven’t seen done better elsewhere. However, it has managed to get better as it progresses. Although uneven in most aspects, this show is a good introductory title that will likely bring many newcomers into the fold of anime fandom.",5
naruto,"I have been watching Naruto since it began airing in CN back in 2005, but at the time, it was on in the dub English version. I liked it, but it was not as good as it turned out to be in the original Japanese version! I love the voice actors, the music, the characters, and the storyline. It is an anime that is not only original and in its own class, but it will make you either cry, laugh, and/or smile when every episode is over. It is really great, and one of the best anime out there. It offers so much if you would give it the opportunity to demonstrate its worth. I love it now, and am currently watching the Naruto Shippuden series, and there are no words to describe it except: sugoi! Arigato, Mr. Masashi Kishimoto. You are the best for bringing my beloved Naruto into my life, as well as in many others. ^.^",5
naruto,"When I first started watching, I wasn't at all impressed.  However, it was interesting enough that I didn't drop it during the introduction arc.  The Land of Waves arc really got me hooked though.  It remains the most interesting part of the entire series (including what I've seen of Shippuden, which I'm up-to-date on).  The Chuunin exam arc kept things going strong.  However, the show goes into a rather steady decline after that.  I'm not even sure how to describe what went wrong.  This is partially because it's been so long since I watched it.  The non-stop filler that takes up the last nearly 100 episodes with was just terrible and why I took away half a star from the Overall, Storyline and Character scores.  Any sane person should completely skip episodes 136+ and go straight to watching Shippuden or drop it entirely.  Personally, I wish I had dropped it after the Chuunin Exam arc but I have this crazy determination to see it through to the end.  I don't really expect to be rewarded for this, I just don't know how to convince myself to stop.I'd easily recommend that anyone watch it at least to the end of the Land of Waves arc(episode 19).  I can even recommend that anyone who enjoyed that much to go as far as episode 80.  However, the further you go beyond that the harder it is to recommend watching.  The plot itself hits a real nose dive around episode 107 that it still hasn't really recovered from(even in the manga up to chapter 497).  I wouldn't even recommend episodes 136-220(the dreaded filler arcs) to my worst enemies.It really makes me sad to think about how much I liked this show back in the early days.The opening and ending themes have been off and on terrible or mediocre.  However, the use of music during the show has been rather effective at times.  As the show drags on, the use of music seems to be getting repetitive though.  This is why I gave it a low score.  It's too bad I can't give a varied score.  Depending on which episodes you talk about, my scores would vary a great deal.",5
naruto,"Naruto is a story about a boy named Naruto who wants to become the most powerful ninja in his village. With the help of new comrades and friends, Naruto begins to learn his way of the ninja. Will he become hokage, or will his fate end in dispear?This Anime is exactly like the Manga. There are fillers add in the Anime, but it helps show the relatonships between the ninjas. There is a second part of Naruto called, Naruto Shippuuden. I love it.As of 9/10/09, there are 463 chapters of Naruto. There are 220 episodes, 4 OVAs, and 3 movies for this first part of Naruto!From wikipedia:The series centers on the adventures of Naruto Uzumaki, a young, excitable ninja of Konohagakure. He is accompanied by fellow ninja Sasuke Uchiha, one of the last members in the Uchiha clan; Sakura Haruno, an intelligent and fiery kunoichi; and Kakashi Hatake, the Jōnin sensei of the three. Throughout the series, Naruto encounters numerous foes, including the Sunagakure ninja Gaara, the S-class criminal Orochimaru, and the mysterious criminal organization Akatsuki.From Onemanga:Twelve years before the events at the focus of the series, the nine-tailed demon fox attacked Konohagakure. It was a powerful demon indeed; a single swing of one of its nine tails would raise tsunamis and flatten mountains. It raised chaos and slaughtered many people, until the leader of the Leaf Village - the Fourth Hokage - defeated it by sacrificing his own life to seal the demon inside a newly-born child, whose origins are as yet unknown. That child's name was Naruto Uzumaki.",5
naruto,"This is a series beloved by many, both rookies and anime veterans. Very justly so. The story, animation, mood, and music of Naruto are of a quality nearly unmatched in modern anime selection. That is of course, when they are actually following the story.As fantastic as the Naruto story is, this series has more filler than literally any other I have personally seen to date, and the filler is, with remarkably few exceptions, terrible. You watch an incredible plot of growth and perseverance culminate in a tear jerking cathartic release one moment, the next, the cast is inexplicably somewhere different, chasing a foulmouthed ninja duck and its irksome hijinks. The brakes on this train of awesome are far too frequently thrown.tl;dr:Naruto is a competent, thought-provoking, and thrilling series, when they actually stick to the story.",5
naruto,"Yep. I know. You see the review title and totally cringe right? You probably want to correct me about it not being about ninjas, but instead shinobis. Yes. You're probably right. Except the fact that ninja = shinobi. :DBut anyway. It's hard to review this anime since it's been a long running one. By the time, you most likely already know if you're a Naruto fan or not.

Has lots of comedy and humor, lots of fighting, and the coolest ninjas you can ever see. This is a must see for all people who are new to anime or just want to watch awesomeness. Watch Naruto first, then Shippuden, then Boruto: Naruto next generations to get the whole idea, its like a sequel so don't skip anything.",5
naruto,"Frankly it's the best show in the genre since Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z. If you feel like embarking on an epic adventure with great story, compelling characters and great action, this is for you !The ninja techniques are great, seeing Naruto learn and evolve is exciting and makes you want to watch episodes after episodes without stoping. Plus there is a whole lot a fantastic characters and background stories.The only drawback is that you will want to have a reference website so you can skip the filler-episodes which to me are really a bother and loss of time.Appart from that, just go and watch it !I'm pretty sure you won't regret it !",5

I love the story plot, the characters, and how they slowly grow throughout the series. You get to learn about many different characters. I'm not one for a lot of action in anime, but this one is unique. I also find the series uplifting, and it shows us that even though we may have had a hard life, you are capable of absolutely anything.",4.5
naruto,"I have to say honestly that if you feel like you hate this show, you probably haven't given it a good enough shot. While Naruto might be a little bit of a pest in the beginning the truth and depth that is revealed is beyond expectations. Of course there is a flow of the seasons and some filler episodes occur, but those season finales almost always have me in tears. Naruto is such a brave and inspiring character, we should all strive to live more like him!",4.5
naruto,"Naruto is the story of battling ninjas, sure, but on the more personal level, it's a story of growing up. At the start, the main three characters, Naruto, Sakura, and Sasuke, are very much children. They go to school, have classes, and are assigned to their very first team as apprentices to a master ninja. Then the story transitions into their learning to be a team and facing conflicts in their local area before moving on to steadily grander threats.Over the course of the approximately five years of the story (some of which are skipped in their entirety), all three struggle to overcome their respective pasts. For Naruto, it is a battle against all that comes with having been a lonely outcast for so long. For Sasuke, it is his inner battle with his need for revenge—to hunt down and kill the one who killed his entire clan. For Sakura, it's dealing with overcoming her feelings of love in order to do what is necessary. It's through facing these internal conflicts—as well as many external ones—that they enter into the realm of adulthood.Better still, their growth toward maturity is always a gradual change and never a light switch. The events and revelations of the manga build on one another to shape the characters—especially when it comes to Sasuke. The main story of Naruto covers everything from life in a ninja school, ninja training, and a ninja tournament to an attack from ninja terrorists, a ninja kidnapping, and a giant ninja war. However, it's outside of the main plot that Naruto does its best work.Free from the constraints of the main story, the side-story flashbacks are dark tales of life before Naruto's generation. The histories of Kakashi, the Fourth Hokage, the First Hokage, the Sannin, and Pain are all excellent little tales that pack more emotional punch than any part of the main plot. These are stories that carry far more in the way of tension and danger as, unlike in the main story, the worst can and often does happen—leaving friendships broken and friends dead.What's even more interesting is how these tales not only flesh out the supporting cast but several also serve as a mirror tale to the lives of Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura. Many deal with a love triangle of ninjas—a team of two boys and a girl. Some then deal with one of the three going down a dark path. Most include a loving mentor character who takes the three under wing to train them. Through these past tales, we are able to see how badly the relationship between Naruto, Sakura, and Sasuke could get without ever having to—necessarily—take it there.Of course, it's not just the characters in the flashbacks that really shine in Naruto—the supporting cast is also full of awesome characters. There are ninjas that can fly, ninjas that can take over other people's bodies, ninjas that can heal grievous wounds, ninjas that can copy other ninjas' skills, ninjas that can raise the dead, ninjas that can turn into paper, ninjas that can control the sand or water or shadows or insects. Hell, there's even a ninja who is basically a superpowered Bruce Lee. With 700 chapters, there’s time for nearly every single character to be given a distinct personality and background—especially the ones that come into direct conflict with Naruto at one point or another.Unfortunately, these characters are often established and then simply forgotten about as the story once again refocuses on Naruto, Sakura, or Sasuke. This is a bit of a double-edged sword as, more often than not, the side characters are more interesting than the main three—especially more so than Naruto himself.Naruto had its ups and downs over its run. However, what is most important when it comes to making a final judgment on a work is to understand what it was trying to be. In this case, I think it's no stretch to say that Naruto strives to be an exciting, action-filled shonen fighting manga. And in that, it succeeds in grand fashion. It builds a colorful world full of ninjas with unique powers and personalities. It has battle after battle where the fate of our heroes (if not the world) seems in question—leaving us enthralled as we wait to see how, exactly, they come out on top. It also does some darn good storytelling in its character backstory arcs.It is not without its faults—mainly those stemming from its pace, length, and reliance on shonen fighting manga tropes—but in end, if you're looking for a meaty manga full of fighting and adventure, Naruto is for you.",4.5
naruto,"Naruto's plot centers around a knuckle-headed, yet moral ninja named Naruto Uzumaki. Naruto lives in the Hidden Leaf Village(Konoha), but there are also many other Hidden Villages as well! The story is very original and has a few very amusing jokes as well! The plot is thoroughly thought out and creative. Naruto is story of hardship and courage. It has many funny, sad, and touching moments. It is certainly one of my favorite anime ever!P.S. There are many fillers as well, but if you truly love the plot, it will be no problem!",4.5
naruto,"Ive never been so addicted to a television show in my lifetime. I immediately was engaged in the story, the characters, the epic fights, and Narutos growth as the series went on. My only problem was the last 90 episodes or so are filler so id recommend just reading a synopsis, watching maybe the last arc [Totally optional] and jumping straight to shippuden. But other than that, this anime has virtually no flaws and i could almost guarantee it'll be someone you'd greatly enjoy.",4.5
naruto,"At first I was turned away by the age of Naruto and his friends. But then was introduced to every other character and it becomes a great village I want to be apart of. I think it's a perfect anime for anyone to jump into if they are into ninjas. I also love how the characters grow, but also age. Naruto is easily one of my favorite anime series of all time. Would recommend to any casual or serious anime fan.",5
naruto,"It's hard to give this show the justice it deserves, so I'll just simply say that it kicks the crud out of anything I've watched! If you're not watching Naruto now, you should definitely start! There's lots to enjoy, and it's guaranteed that you'll get addicted to this show, in fact, you'll get so addicted that if you stop watching it for an extended period of time you will undoubtedly experience severe withdrawal. Get into it, but be warned..... Once you're in, you'll never be able to leave.",5
naruto,naruto is just awesome it was the first anime i watched i suddenly got  insterested in all diffrent animes sasuke he has to be the worst character kakashi is awesome naruto main character whos my brother sakura an annoying girl who is in love with sasuke .  i think many love this anime  ♥ if u are reading this and u don't watch naruto i will make u ♥ next time u pass naruto go up give my first anime a try,5
naruto,"Naruto is one of my ""hall of fame"" series, and a MUST see for everyone.  It is the prelude series to Naruto Shipuden, which is an excellent continuation of the saga founded in Naruto.Three facts that will tempt you to stop watching Naruto, but shouldn't stop you because you will miss out on great content if you do:1.  It starts slow.  I almost lost interest in the series because the opening episodes didn't do it for me.  I'm so glad I stuck it out.  Naruto gets GOOD.  If you find the series slow, I STRONGLY encourage you to stick it out for several episodes.  You will ""get into it"" as the story begins to unwind.2.  It's not amazing graphically.  The series is high production, as well as shippuden is.  They got to roll one out every week and being able to draw it fast and roll out the story takes higher priority than some other animations out there that specialize in ""eye candy"".  Naruto is not where you go for stunning drawings, but the storyline and voice acting is excellent.  The series really delivers.3.  The protagonist, Naruto, you may find unlikeable.  I did.  As the series unfolds, I assure you this won't be a problem.  There are plenty of other characters that get lots of screen time for you to enjoy, even if you're not a fan of Naruto himself.  The type of person Naruto changes into may make him more appealing later on.  If you don't like the brat in the orange jumpsuit, that's OK -- there are plenty of things to enjoy about Naruto.I'm giving it a 5. Like I said at the top of my review, its one of my ""Hall of Fame"" series.  If you can work past the three obstacles I mentioned, I think you will really enjoy Naruto and its amazing story.",4.5
naruto,"This series –all 9 seasons– is the only anime I have watched and read the manga to, it is also the only one that I have watched religiously for many years now, and even at my age of 38 I still love this series.As a professional creative I appreciate the well developed storyline and narrative that gets more solid with each episode, and as the world of Naruto grows within your heart and mind you will find yourself overflowing with admiration for this brat that would be Hokage...which upon viewing all 9 seasons you will naturally gravitate to Naruto Shippuden to quench your thirst.There are great ethical stories and other life lessons within this series, making it a great watch for kids to learn that family and friendship are the most important things one can ever hope to achieve above all in this world.",4.5
naruto,"GREAT character development, especially with Naruto. Naruto has his flaws and past, so he needs to overcome them.Love the concept about trying hard. These ninjas don't always have good genes; they train hard to become the best, even when they fail.Naruto goes through quite an adventure, and he's very likeable, so you just wanna see him do well. There's not much of a focus on antagonists, but the characters have to go through some internal conflicts and ninja battles which show their true colors.BUT:There's a bunch of fillers.",4
naruto,"Naruto is absolutely amazing! I was hesitant when I first started watching it, but did so because my husband liked it, but within a couple episodes you get so unbelievably hooked! I've now watched it through a couple times (some arcs more than others ^_^) The music is amazing (in my mind the music from Naruto is much better than Shippuden) and the characters are so complex and well defined. Every time I have a favorite character, something makes me love another even more. The storyline is also amazing, and so well written, so it can be heartrendingly emotional that I cry and then so comedic I laugh for hours. Sometimes the episode storylines get very redundant (repeating scenes from earlier episodes over and over) but as the series is serial I understand it (it must be very different waiting for a new episode each week rather than watching all at once as I prefer). Overall, it's definitely my favorite anime - I love it!",4
naruto,"This show is awesome and I love everything about it. It is great to see how much Naruto tries and never gives up. He in a way is an inspiration and shows never to give up and always do the right thing no matter what. Doing the right things all the time can be painful and sometimes really scary but always does more than doing the wrong thing. It shows in all the things naruto does. When he actually listens to kakashi sensei, he does better. when he listens he gets better.",4
naruto,"I think over all the story line is great, there were some pretty boring fillers at the end, but in general an amazing series. I learned quite a handful of japanese phrases from this series and that just makes my day. The music is awesome, and the characters are amazing as well. My personal favorite is Kimimaro with his kekkai genkai. The animation was very well done, and I would recommend this title to anyone.",4
naruto,"I honestly love this show. There are all sorts of twists that you wouldn't expect. The whole idea of supernatural ninjas just excites me and i wish i could live in Konaha along with the characters. I can relate to the characters and laugh with them, cry with them and hurt with them. There have been times where i have burst out laughing and times when i really did cry.The story line is well written with flash backs to help you remember stuff that happened in the past.Overall this is my favourite anime show!",4
naruto,"Naruto is a boy who left his previous village and went to a school in a new village in order to get people's respect. He is funny, sweet, and trust worthy. He is always determined to do something when he says he's going to do it, no matter how long it takes him. While going to an Academy for Ninja's, he meets an amibitious girl named Sakura (who he quickly falls in love with) and a mysterious boy named Sasuke (who he quickly begins to hate automatically). Sakura is a young girl who takes really good care of her long flowing pink hair in order to win Sasuke's heart. Every girl is told that Sasuke only likes girls with long hair so everyone including Sakura is wearing their hair long. Sakura is competing with every girl, that is true enough, but her biggest rival is a girl named Ino who also has long hair but it's blonde. They are always fighting, but the secret that they refuse to admit to is that they are still good friends deep inside their hearts. Sakura is deeply in love with Sasuke and is determined to win his love no matter what. She is also determined to understand Sasuke more, but soon finds that it is hard to do. And this is exactly why Naruto hates him. Sasuke is a boy with kind of long jet black hair and shocking black eyes to match. He gets annoyed easily and is just as competetive as Naruto, though he won't dare admite it. Sasuke has a violent past. His parents are killed in a battle and Sasuke blames his self because of it. Sasuke left his village because he wanted to become stronger than he already is so he can return to his village and avenge his family. Sasuke also has a secret demon power deep inside him that he does not know about until later on their journey, he accidentally uses it and is unable to control the demon within him. But Sakura refuses to think of Sasuke as a demon. Each of them not only learn how to be ninja's, but they also learn more about themselves and each other as well. Through their journey, one of them end up missing. And no one know's if it's for good or not. Which one is it?",5
naruto,"naruto is really worth 5 stars anime, this is the best anime to see me, although not yet see all Serj, but really because the finish is worth watch.

Sorry uz lauzyta anlgu kalba pradzioje ...",5
naruto,"I have known about this anime for a long time, and never watched it because i have heard about it from everyone, and I thought "" I am not going to watch it, it is to mainstream, but   my brother was watching an episode, and instantly I got hooked.  Everything about it is amazing, even the filler episodes, and the music, story, characters, just everything in general. I love how you are able to feel several emotions while watching this, whether it be happy, suspense, fear, sad, or any other emotion, it really gets you to feel, and for me, an anime that has that ability to do that, is truly amazing.  I binge watched the entire 9 seasons within 3 months, and as I was on the last episode, i was thinking to myself ""come on just end already"" because I wanted to start Shippuden.  But as it got closer to the end, my attitude towards the end dramatically ""don't end, don't end"" I kept thinking to myself, and I was a little sad when it did end.  But I immediately switched to Shippuden.",5
naruto,"A few people will say Naruto is a childish, slow, and boring anime but the majority and myself included will always love this show. Naruto is a pretty great character and watching the original right here preps you for Shippuden, which is even better. Naruto and Sasuke also make for what is probably the best rivalry in anime history which by itself makes the show amazing. As for the filler, yeah it usually sucks so just look up what is and isn't and skip it.",5
naruto,"I watched all 220 epsiodes and despite the incredible amount of filler, especially towards the end, I very much enjoyed it all. Overall I enjoyed the characters each having their own unique abilities and the pacing worked pretty well regardless of the filler areas. The filler even added some episodes with more supporting cast for more face time which was great seeing as Naruto was not my most favorite character. Anyways I watched it in roughly 10 weeks breaking up each season with a random anime of my choosing. It was well worth it and I look forward to Part 2.",5
naruto,"I use to be a huge fan of this anime and manga, but I've begun to realize different things about this series. It's got a pretty interesting storyline, but it seems to go by much too quickly and there were too many fillers between the first series and Naruto: Shippuden. And typical of a lot of animes, the Characters tend to grow more mature throughout the series, but these characters were much too annoying to begin with and plenty were still a pain in the neck by episode 200. The music wasn't all that impressive, and the anime was average. It was an okay show and it can be somewhat interesting.",4
naruto,"Naruto was born the son of Minato Namikaze, the Fourth Hokage, and Kushina Uzumaki. Before his birth, they had decided to name him after the main character in Jiraiya's first book, hoping their son would be as great a ninja as the character was. This made Jiraiya Naruto's godfather. Soon after his birth, however, the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox attacked Konohagakure. To save the village, Minato engaged the Nine-Tails in mortal combat and sealed it into Naruto's body, believing his son would someday have use for it. Minato died afterwards, leaving Naruto to grow up knowing nothing of his parents. He received his mother's last name since Hiruzen Sarutobi, the Third Hokage, felt that it was best that nobody knew he was related to the Fourth Hokage. Before Minato died, he asked that the villagers of Konoha view Naruto as a hero who had helped to stop the Nine-Tails. Few did as he asked, however, instead openly resenting him for containing the monster that had destroyed their home. In light of this, the Third Hokage decreed that nobody should ever speak of the Nine-Tails sealed within Naruto, hoping that their children would not resent him as they did. The children, however, followed their parents' lead, despite not knowing why. Naruto was forced to live confused over why the villagers hated him so, and strived to win their recognition. Iruka Umino would be one of the few exceptions, who was always compassionate to Naruto's plight. For this, Naruto came to view Iruka as the father-figure he never had. PersonalityBefore graduating from the Academy, Naruto had a craving for acknowledgement. During his days as an academy student, Naruto would play pranks all around the village in an attempt to be recognized by its inhabitants. He would also tell everyone who doubted him on a near-constant basis that he would one day become Hokage. As he told Iruka, he wished to achieve this rank in order to be recognized by those around him, and to have the responsibility of defending them. Even after graduating, Naruto was still determined to be recognized, and became the ""Number One Loudest, Unpredictable, Hyperactive Knuckleheaded Ninja of Konoha"", as described by Kakashi Hatake. As the series progressed, with Naruto making more and more connections with others, his reasons for wanting to become Hokage underwent a change, having less to do with the desire for recognition, and more to do with wanting the strength to protect his home and the people close to him. Naruto's exuberant personality and fiery desire for self-improvement strongly impacts the lives of those around him. At the beginning of the series, Naruto befriended Konohamaru Sarutobi, the grandson of the Third Hokage, and it is through his brief tutelage that Konohamaru learned that the path to success is through plenty of hard work. Kakashi described this as Naruto's ""unique power"", as he seems to change the world views of everyone he meets, and inspires courage for the future within them. This is most prominently shown when Naruto earned the trust of Nagato, the leader of Akatsuki, and one of the main antagonists of the series. As mentioned above, Naruto is characterized as being hyperactive; he is typically exuberant, easily excitable, impulsive, and suffers from a short attention span. This is supported by Asuma Sarutobi in the 'Fire Temple' arc in the anime, describing Naruto as being the type who doesn't think before acting, similar to Sora. Asuma also identifies Naruto's personality type and fighting style, like Sora's, as being a 'power type'--types that are best suited to 'charging straight in'--and are best effective in battle when sent in first, in the front to 'clear a path' through the enemy's defensive line, making a way in after them for the rest of the team. While raw power is one of his strengthes, Naruto has begun to learn in recent chapters that it is something that he needs to temper with focus in order for it to become truely effective. According to Kakashi, Naruto is someone who learns through his body. Naruto is relatively naive, being slow to understand a jutsu's principles, and often requiring a dumbing-down of an already dumbed-down analogy in order to grasp what is being explained to him. This assumes he is able to keep his attention long enough, as he commonly seeks to change the subject in light of his ignorance, outwardly insisting that he already gets the concept. Though he retains this confidence in himself to great degrees, loudly proclaiming that he will master whatever technique he is learning in a fraction of the usual time, Naruto will not hesitate to ask for help if he needs it. As an extension of his naivety, Naruto has a number of childish traits. His pajamas always include a comical black nightcap with eyes and teeth, and he keeps his money in a chubby, green-frog wallet he affectionately calls ""Gama-chan"". He almost exclusively eats ramen, and is a frequent customer at the Ichiraku Ramen Bar. He has a natural affinity for perverted ideas and jutsu, something he tends to be reprimanded for by Sakura, and which is only brought to new levels after meeting Jiraiya. He also smiles near-constantly, which, during his childhood, was to mask the sadness of his lonely life. Those who are closest to him are able to recognize when his smile isn't genuine. However, when the situation calls for it, typically when someone dear to him is in trouble, Naruto can be very serious, and will instantly come to their aid. This is most commonly seen in the series through his interactions with his teammates, Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura Haruno. With Sasuke, Naruto views him as a brother, and throughout Part II strives to bring him back to Konoha, despite his willing defection from the village. With Sakura, Naruto has a long-standing crush on her, and will do all in his power to make her happy, even if it is at the expense of his own happiness. Recently, Hinata Hyuga confessed her love for Naruto. He was greatly angered when she was seemingly fatally wounded afterwards, and was relieved to hear that she had survived, but it is unclear whether he now has feelings for her. After talking with his father, defeating Nagato and having a truce with him and Konan, Naruto came to understand the downside of revenge, and desired to stop Sasuke from it even more. Also, Naruto tried to stop the Kumo-nins from exacting their revenge against Sasuke, for this would only create a cycle of hatred.",5
naruto,"I like the OG Naruto better than Shippuden in many different ways.First, the characters are still in development and its much better to experience them grow up as children. Especially first impressions on their family members that died.Second, naruto isn't the most powerful character in the series between all of their friends.Lastly, The naruto vs sasuke fight tops the one in shippuden because it's over a friendship while the one in shippuden is the title of hokage. Although sasuke actually wanted to kill naruto in shippuden and he was fighting for his life, it doesn't compare to naruto not wanting his best friend to leave forever.Opinons:(fuck orochimaru)(temari is fucking amazing)(gaara is dope as fuck)(sasuke > naruto)(fuck sakura dumb useless bitch)(kakashi, iruka, and jiraya best sensei's)(zabuza is actually amazing)(o m g fuck kabuto)(itachi is the most powerful character thats appeared in OG naruto)(kurama is <3)Love it <3",5
naruto,Naruto was one of those animes that I wish I had seen ages ago. I only finished it last year and I absolutely adored it. (I'm watching it again this year with my family) Great story telling and an amazing protagonist. I completely fell in love with Naruto and cheering on the underdog. There are fillers but searching a simple filler list and skipping those specific episodes is easy enough to do! Worth it for Naruto Shippuden!!! :3,5
naruto,This show is the Naruto of Anime. All other Narutos are just copying this Naruto. That's pretty lame! My favorite Character is Hinata.My favorite jutsu is Sexy no jutsu.I think Naruto is annoying but that is what makes Saske seem bad ass. Otherwise he would just be a skilled ninja.Kakashi should write his own novels. Rock Lee is pretty much everything I wish I was as a person.Watching Naruto got me through some hard times.,5
naruto,"I will keep this review short and accurate. Naruto is one of the best animes ever made, it helped me grow up, and become the person I am today. I stopped watching Naruto about 2 years ago, and suddenly my family told me, that my personality had changed, I didn't know why, I just guessed that it was me growing up, but about a week ago I started watching it again, and I realised why I've changed so much, I forgot about Naruto and his nindo, his ninja way. Which is why Naruto is so amazing, it changes you as a person, makes you view life in a different way, makes you feel sad, makes you feel happy, makes you feel a certain way I've never experienced with any other anime, ever. Naruto is in my opinion the second greatest anime of all time, right behind Dragon Ball (The original series). Thank you Naruto, for making me the person I am today.",5
naruto,"Not sure if this is allowed Edit: Dont know why im reviewing naruto XDThis is a ?video essay? about two of the characters in the 2009 shaft anime adaptation of Nisioisin’s Light novel; Bakemonogatari. Yes, my opinions are objective. And no my grmmar doesnt invalidate my points :pSenjougahara is your typical more tsun than dere bitch who uses and abuses harem guy until she shows just that little bit of dere causing the collective fan base cream themselves so hard that a space time paradox rips threw anime returning tsundere-chan into the defensive bitch she was in episode 1. yeah? NoSenjoubahara has a real backstory, with real trauma and reasons to be a hateful horny hedgehog, until she takes her clothes of in the second episode.... Whuh? So if type 1 tsundere is a developed character with lingering mental trauma giving her in-character reasons to be a bitch. And the type 2 tsundere imitation with no backstory is created for otakus who get off on girls with lingering mental health trauma repackaged into their favorite candy hair colour.. then which is Gahara-san? Well, when we first meet Senjouharuhi she threatens to kill harem guy with stationary because he found out about her weight problem.  After he offers to help she is initially sceptical but plays along and then she takes her clothes off and NO! Goddammit! This franservice is not ok because her clothes are heavy and the plot* makes sense for her to be naked. Thats like saying its not incenst beacuse she isn't technically… That's the dumbest shit I've ever heard. She gets naked infront of chick magnet because she’s sexy and wants to show it! She is a narcissist and it's one of the few things she still has left to brag about. Senjou Joestar used to be the ace of the track team, but that crab took away from her strength and now she struggles to attend school. She doesn't have much pride left in herself.And without her pride, she can't be herself. ….Yeah its a youtube video and I edited it a lothttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcEv5_53U8Q&t=302s&ab_channel=XistentialAnime",5
naruto,"The reason why I stated this title like and a Star Wars quote it is simple.When people talk about ninjas and the magic that comes within the normal ninja genre of TV show you'd think of those black marshal arts clothes with the black tight eye opening hood over the ninja's head and face, but this turns the game in it's head.For you see the way it does that is how it is shown to the viewer, it is not as simple as throwing down a smoke bomb and there is a ninja after the fact but that trope is still there but it not just blindings and mystic tactics as well.This anime is filled with references to dragonball, normal street wear and real world SWAT gear plus games like snake-toad-slug a eastern version of rock–paper–scissors with wichcraft in the forms of the Ninjutsu, Genjutsu & Taijutsu with the allowance of nature elemental forces to be involved as well with fire, water, earth, wind and lighting commonly found in various Chinese and Japanese cultures.I personally enjoy this even with the filler episodes. If it not but the SWAT like gear you know the place they come from by the little strip of material with an engraved metal plate that is either on their head of on different parts of their bodies. Also there is many more things I would love to say but that is for another review.",5
naruto,"Something that has always fascinated me about Naruto is the way it tackles social isolation and the effect it can have on kids' development. Various characters are shown to face difficult emotions due to circumstances they cannot control. However, all three of these characters choose to react to this adversity in different ways. -Naruto becomes the village idiot to use rebelliousness and comedy to mask the pain he feels inside, as the village shuns him for his literal inner demon. -Rock Lee procures insane determination to prove himself to the world to the point where it becomes toxic to his own health, as he cannot use ninjutsu like the other children.-Gaara, facing a similar situation as Naruto, lashes out against the world and refuses to even allow his siblings to reach out to him when they express concern.-Sasuke, despite being beloved by just about everyone for being a cool prodigy, is obsessed with revenge, preventing him from developing bonds with his friends and mentors.-Neji, in a similar vein to Sasuke, obsesses over his lineage, and resents Hinata for the position she was born into.-Hinata, having been entrusted with immense responsibility from birth, lacks the courage and self esteem to be assertive and stand up to Neji.-Sakura, despite being a talented leader, student, and ninja, focuses too much on trivial matters like impressing/surpassing her friend Ino and the distant Sasuke, instead of pursuing her own dreams.As the show progresses, we see how these characters reach out to each other inspire and to overcome their weaknesses. Naruto's greatest strength is his ability to empathize with his peers and rivals. Ultimately, Naruto is about the power of empathy, and how friendship can help almost anyone overcome their deepest of fears.Skip the filler though.",5

naruto,I have been watching this show all the way back when i was trying to kick everyone off the TV so I could watch it on toonami. You will love this show. I promise. I will admit there is a better chance you will like this one rather than shippuden but if you want to give naruto a wall deserved chance this is where to start. I have kept up with the show ever since. I can tell you I have watched literally every single episode and the original series I have watched more than twice. Ill admit shippuden has flaws. Since I have watched every episode seeing all the flashbacks and filler can get kinda agitating but this show has spanned my entire life and keeping up with it as a whole has been a dream come true. I love this show. I hope Boruto doesnt let me down now!!,5
naruto,"Naruto is one of my favorite animes. It may have started off a bit slow but if picked up as it went on and got better and better. Though it may be lengthy, I would recommend Naruto to anyone. It has great characters with great personalities, quirks, and overall characteristics that make you drawn to certain ones, like Kakashi for example, and make you hate others. There are very few bad things I could say about this Anime. My favorite section of the entire show was the fight between Zabuza and Kakashi. It's the first real fight and one of the best, in my opinion. There are some filler episodes. If they weren't placed at the worst possible places in the seasons, they wouldn't be that bad.",5
naruto,"Naruto's got a decent story. It's about love, loss, jealousy, and arrogance. I wouldn't diss it for the world; it's got some strong characters. But the filler really uses those characters for something that isn't so ""end-of-the-world"" stakes, and as a result, many of the best episodes are found in the filler; if you want to have favorite characters in this show, go through the filler, for sure.The sequel is where most of the plot ends up happening.",5
naruto,"At first I thought it was a bit young. But, holy crap! As the characters get older it builds up and blows you away!! TOTALLY, worth watching!!I truly believe this should be mandatory television for American tweens/teenagers. It has ALL the learning lessons and morality that is missing in todays programming!  The depth of the characters and situations go to a level that I've NEVER experienced in American television. As an Adult, I thoroughly enjoyed it! And, you should continue with Shippuden it is EPIC.",5
naruto,"I'll admit, I'd been an anime fan for a while before I finally got around to watching Naruto. My main reason for finally watching it was simply to understand all the memes floating around the internet, and I'm really glad I did. I'm in Season 7, and am totally invested. It is a great series! Hilarious and full of interesting action as well as plot... even the filler episodes aren't too bad. (and there are a TON of filler episodes) I can't wait to see where this series goes! (and am even happier that I don't have to wait for anything to be released since it's all already out!)  If you're a fan of Fairy Tail and Bleach, then I think you'll love this series too. Naruto and Natsu are practically the same person.",5
naruto,"I've seen a lot of anime throughout the years. I've seen what people call the 'good stuff', I've seen the 'bad stuff'. In time, I realized and accepted that not everyone is going to like something, or dislike it. No matter what the anime (or movie, or book, or game, etc.) it boils down to personal preference. So, how do you know if you'd like something you've never seen but heard so much about? When I first started Naruto, I saw the potential in it. From the first episode, they presented a distinct setting with distinct characters. Sure, archetypes were being followed (the boy dreaming of becoming big, the old grandfatherly figure, the teacher, the rival). The first episode showed emotion and depth to its main character and what he will struggle with, along with the dynamics of his interaction with other characters and their quirks.Cut about ten episodes later, the plot arc currently being followed felt to me like it was not going to matter much to the main story. Some episodes had drawn out battles, and I got that feeling that the anime would be the type where they would go from different area to different area, developing their skills and learning moral lessons and such, but there would be no grand plot, no B story, that tied the series together. I also worried it would fall into mediocrity. Without giving anything away, by the end of that arc (about 19 episodes in), my mind was changed.Having seen all of the series up to the current episodes, I can say at least for myself that at its best Naruto is a deeper anime than some give credit to, and can be quite addicting. A strong focus is on its characters as they develop throughout the series and there are moments of real emotion, tragedy, intensity and even just amusement. It's not perfect, as there are slow times in the series (and the cartoon suffers from tricks to get as many episodes out of the original story as they can), and I won't say everyone will end up liking it but I can say it had unexpectedly become one of my favorite anime.",5
ace-of-the-diamond,"But that didn't stop me from absolutely loving this anime. It isn't just about baseball; it's about so much more. That being said, the series has taught me a lot about the game that I never really could understand or appreciate before, and I have a deeper respect for it now. I think that in itself is a great compliment you can give to something; where it changes your opinion on what you previously thought was a boring sport.But besides that, what really makes this show is the character development, story, and execution of that story. The quality of animation, music, and directing really makes this series shine. It feels top notch, you really get into each character and become a fan of the team yourself.In the most recent episodes, the series has really shown itself to go far beyond what I had ever expected; and for that I will say this is now a must watch series. You are going to have a lot of feels watching these characters grow, and you'll never expect where things turn out.I'm excited to see where the series goes, and I can't wait for the new episode each week. It has me totally hooked. I highly recommend checking this out, sports fan or not.",4.5
ace-of-the-diamond,"Fantastic anime, but more importantly one of the most accurate depictions of baseball in any media I've watched.  Having played on a high level American high school baseball team in the past, I'm shocked at how closely Seido's practices (especially all of the running and sprinting) mirror what our team used to do in high school.  Even more importantly, as a former pitcher for many years, I'm incredibly happy with the show's depiction of the pitcher-catcher battery, and the strategic mindset.  The pitcher-catcher battle with the batter is truly what makes baseball one of the most intense sports to play.  Can't wait to the see this show continue to play out!  As of episode 18, it's my favorite sports anime of all time!  Sawamura's gonna need to learn a change-up pretty soon though, haha.",5
ace-of-the-diamond,"Well when I started this anime, which was when it was 8 episodes in, I didn't expect much. Just this baseball anime with cool animation. I have never been so wrong in my life. This anime is thrilling, competitive, and non-stop (baseball) action! Each week I am left with despair, however, as I must wait for the next episode for an ENTIRE WEEK. Pretty painful. Regardless, I recommend this anime to everyone, baseball fan or not, sports anime fan or not. You will definitely enjoy it, or at least get a good laugh at Sawamura's (the main character) stupidity.",5
ace-of-the-diamond,"This series starts off a little slowly and a bit differently from your typical sports anime, but the excitement and competition ramp up like crazy soon enough! What sets ""Daiya no Ace"" apart from other baseball anime is that, usually, the heroes are a small underdog team that takes down the big teams that dominate Koushien. But this time, DnA is about one of those big, elite teams, and the excitement comes from the competition within the team to get one of the 9 spots on the first-string starting team. This allows for an unprecedented level of individual rivalry (which, c'mon, is the best part of sports anime~). Our hero Sawamura is a diamond-in-the-rough pitcher with a lot of promise but no proper training. He is lured away from his close-knit (if bumbling) team out in the countryside to Seido High's elite baseball team by the charismatic prodigy catcher Miyuki, whose insightful strategies and ability to draw out pitchers' potential have made him the starting catcher on the first-string after only one year on the team. Miyuki sees massive potential in Sawamura and it seems a perfect battery is on its way to being formed--until the appearance of another first-year pitcher, Furuya, whose quiet personality belies a monstrous strength. For years, Furuya's pitches have been so powerful that no catcher has been able to catch them (which is why no one had heard of Furuya's insane ability--he was never allowed to play since no one could catch his pitches). He came all the way to Seido from Hokkaido in the hopes that he'd finally meet a catcher who could catch his pitches and Miyuki does not disappoint. As a result, our two talented first-year pitchers are in competition for their catcher, in addition to facing the many challenges (hazing, politics, traditions, etc) of breaking in to such an elite, historied team. That said, the high energy, comedy, rich character drama, and Sawamura's infectious optimism and disarming kindness make this a very watchable journey, with many interesting characters and some very exciting matches even within the first 13 episodes. Definitely worth the watch, whether you're a sports anime fan or general shonen anime fan. Check it out!",5
ace-of-the-diamond,"Watch this anime.It's been since the last season ended and I'm hazy on character names and plot specifics.... But I remember all the emotions and the character's personalities/abilities. The best thing about sports anime is that it can often present grounded human ability. But's it's still anime, so it has creative ways for you to enjoy, through metaphor, how extraordinary these ""for-granted"" human-honed skills are. That, plus the fleshing out of a cast that's worth caring about over time... sunk me. Good anime. It's the reason I'll be continuing to look into and discover more sports anime. Wouldn't have hopped on Hinomaru Sumo immediately(thank God I did) if it weren't for this.",5
ace-of-the-diamond,"I'm an MLB fan and I find this anime a good reflection of Japanese baseball compared to Major. It's more realistic to see an Eijun than Goro in the MLB. Anyway, as I watch the anime in progress, I appreciate how the role of other players are shown. In MLB or baseball in general, pitchers wont be able to do many feats without the support of his fielders. Take for example Yadi Molina (StL) and Buster Posey (SF), the success of their pitchers are based on their game calls and pitch out plays. Miyuki Kazuya sure does a good job drawing out all the pitchers' potentials while on the mound. The superb plays of the seniors in Seidoh is a classic example of paid off hard work. All players entering MLB are outstanding players in the minors yet they had to go through secondary priority, lots of training, losses, injuries and boos before earning their rightful places as starting member. MC Eijun Sawamura had to go through a lot before earning his place and it takes time, especially that he has a formidable rival within his team. Of course, I would understand coach kataoka not making him as starter because his role doesn't fit him currently. Mariano Rivera is one one of Yankees all time best pitchers, not as a starter but a closer. With over 50 episodes and over 390 chapters, it may seem that the mangaka is making Eijun suffer so much. I'm not sure about the author's intention but I would be very surprised if he becomes the ace given the fact that he's still polishing his skills and there are Furuya and Kawakami who can pitch like him. The take for example Adam wainwright, during his minors, he was always the starter. When he stepped up in the big leagues, he had to go through being reliever, closer then eventually the ace. It took him at least 7 years before he Became the Ace of Cardinals. Of course, HS baseball is much shorter, but given only five months in the entire timeline of the manga, it is but proper that Eijun has his current order as mid reliever. If he were real, he needs another six full months to master his signature pitches. Well, their former ace Tanba took three years and two potential pitchers to compete before he finally understand what is meant to be an ace.BUT HE IS THE MAIN CHARACTER! Yeah obviously, but I don't want to watch another Goro Shigeno in a different anime. We're done with the ""only pitcher in team"" story-line. Hey, I love Major and have watched it until the end. Let's be patient with Eijun and try to study how baseball really works, you will appreciate DnA more than ever.Here's more to appreciate in this series:Baseball terms and plays both offensive and defensive, it's worth researching.Individual stories of supporting charactersCollective skills and talents properly sorted to players not only of Seidoh but also of their opponents.The feels of each team's struggles to win.OSTsIndividual talents such as Miyuki Kazuya, Mei Narumiya, Yuki Tetsuya, Kominato Haruichi, and many more.Hey, DnA is also promoting Mizuno brand.",4
ace-of-the-diamond,"Just as a note, I'm writing this review based off season 1 and the first 33 episodes of season 2.This series is, overall, an enjoyable watch--especially the 1st season. The characters are lovable, the animation is great--what's not to love? The second season doesn't start off bad, either. Sawamura--the protagonist--ends up suffering from a little bit of a psychological struggle after an accident messes with his energetic self-confidence. Throw in a new, (boarder-line) malicious coach only focused on results, and you see how the protagonist's future on the team becomes uncertain. This seems like the moment the series would really be picking up--only, it's around here that you start to see the protagonist being phased out.Then, episode 11 of Season 2 concludes--and the show seems to suddenly leave its protagonist behind for 22 episodes, focusing instead on the less developed and somewhat flat ""rival"" Furuya while Sawamura just makes cameo appearances (even the original team mates, for the most part, seem to forget the protagonist as anything other than a loud cheerleader). Furuya works somewhat well as a little developed supporting character. We don't know much about him since we know little to nothing of his past and he rarely ever talks. In fact, even when we're allowed into his thoughts, he rarely expresses anything except for the silent but raging desire to want to be ace. After 30 episodes of season 2 (on top of 75 episodes of season 1)--we still don't know enough about him for most people to care WHY he wants to be the ace of the team or have any sort of deep emotional connection to his character. More obscure pitchers with fewer scenes on rival teams manage to be more empathetic than him. So, Furuya starts to feel like an ""insert generic, moody, and undeveloped rival here"" sort of character with the added twist of making that character the fill-in protagonist for a large part of Season 2.When Sawamura finally does make his appearance again, those watching the anime feel second-hand embarrassment for him since, in usual form--he flops. He's the most nerfed protagonist I've seen--especially considering how big a deal they made about his potential and raw talent in the first few episodes of season 1.Now, that being said, I have no problem with main characters being the underdog. I don't mind seeing them struggle to climb up. I even don't have a problem if the protagonists fail to meet their goals entirely as they envisioned them. But, at the end of the day, I still want the protagonist to be the protagonist. I want to see THEIR struggles and how THEY are tackling those problems to grow, or how THEY ultimately fail (that's what it means to be the protagonist--to be the character experiencing the conflict).  I don't want to see the protagonist in 5 second intervals in the background, cheering and warming up for over 5 months-worth of episodes only to see him flop as-per-usual when finally getting a chance to shine.Still, I feel like this is probably due to somewhat awkward pacing of the anime. So, I plan to keep watching, because eventually they're bound to get back around to the protagonist's plot-progression in the story. Right?",5
ace-of-the-diamond,"In a genre that has recently been undergoing an evolution with the likes of Baby Steps and Kuroko no Basuke I find it very difficult to recommend Ace of the Diamond. If there was a book explaining in step-by-step detail how to make a sports anime AotD would be following it to a ‘T’. For this reason it’s still watchable, it doesn’t do anything grievously wrong but it also doesn’t do a single thing different from every other sports anime before it.We’ve got our bog standard underdogs, facing our generic antagonists, and going through the usual ups-and-downs as they exceed all odds to come out on top. Now of course even the best sports anime follow this formula but they tend to throw something in to differentiate themselves from the pack. Whether that be unique character traits, special abilities, or perhaps even parts of the show that don’t focus completely on sports and give us reasons behind the sports to like there characters. But there’s none of that here, every single character is as cliché as they get, as are the antics they find themselves in.The animation is of a decent level but not enough to make up for the utter banality of it all. The only reason I can imagine choosing it over superior examples is if you have a serious love for baseball over the other sports on offer, but if you come to the sports genre for the tension and break from the typical epic sword battles of other anime that permeates the genre there are far better choices to pick from.All the same if you do love baseball or have simply exhausted your other options you could do worse than Ace of the Diamond, but don’t expect to find anything special.",4
ace-of-the-diamond,"After watching this anime i have become inspired to become a baseball player, you might think this is a joke but i was actually really moved by this anime, If you ever see the name Andy weir on the billboards it means i made it. only problem is i want to be a pitcher but im 5'5"", what ever that wont stop me, ill practice 100 times harder to make up for my short height. what im trying to get at is that this is an absolutely fantastic anime.",5
ace-of-the-diamond,"Ace of the Diamond is the best baseball anime I've ever seen, hands down (even including Oofuri, if only slightly). It doesn't fall into the traps of so many other sports anime - which is, either 1) only focusing on the main character, shafting the other members of the team, and some dumbass rival; or 2) repeating the trope of a superstar lone player reviving a underdog team and taking them to nationals. It's an anime about a boy who doesn't quite know what he's getting into, but is led by other members of a team who all equally love the sport. It's about growing up without any of the stupid pitfalls and traps of other sports anime. Ace of the Diamond's really strong point is in its varied cast of characters - they're all very individualized, and it really makes you bond with the team and want to root for them. This anime gets me excited like no other.",5
ace-of-the-diamond,"An interesting anime that draws me into baseball which i don't particularly like! There are many characters in this show, which is not surprising since baseball is a major team sport. Pros:Loyalty, teamwork, trust, courage are common themes in the show. It is also rather realistic and easy to connect w/ the the characters. Despite the vast number of characters, I feel like each are given a good amount of screen time+ depth and are likable. Cons: The only exception (development wise), unfortunately, is our main character. I feel like he is not given enough screen time which is a shame since he IS the main character. He seems to be fading a little and I wish more time is spent on HIS growth :/  (so I hesitate over a 4 or 5 star). I hope this changes as more episodes come in.  Other than that, I adore this show so check it out!",5
ace-of-the-diamond,"Ace of Diamond, an anime produced by Production I.G (Kuroko no Basket) & Madhouse (Hajime no Ippo). Both of these animation companies are very knowledgeable in the sports genre as seen in their previous titles. This eventually lead to the creation of this amazing show. This series isn't rushed, it's paced very well and supported by amazing animation. There are a wide variety of characters to enjoy, each is given a certain amount of time to develop. The comedy in this show is just amazing, I found my self laughing almost every episode. I don't know how long this anime will air for but i've heard rumors that it will air for 52 episodes? I guess we'll find out soon. Anyway, this anime is an amazing sports anime to watch, it has great animation, story, OSTs and Openings. I would rate it 10/10 and mark it as a much watch!",4.5
ace-of-the-diamond,"So I really love this anime. I really like sports anime, and Diamond no ace is just spectacular. The story is, yes about baseball, (TBH i don't like sports in general and don't like to watch baseball games) But Diamond no ace is great at capturing the audience. As a person who hates baseball this anime has made me care more. The games are long, but i felt like if i skipped anything, i felt empty and i HAD to watch the whole game.The characters, let me say are awesome. Their personalities are each unique and they all have their own story but bond as a team. However, I felt like could have been beter as was just never as good as he wanted to be. I feel that Sawamura should have been better and i wish for him the best. BUT I still feel as though he was amazing in his own way. His personality as determined but still an idiot (by anime standards). The other characters, lets me just say ARE SO AWESOME TOO!!!! (Especially Miyuki XD) Its got a lot of humor but also is serious and pretty emotional.",4.5
ace-of-the-diamond,"This is about the Act II. The animation feels so bad compared to the Act I. Its not like it was awesome or something before, but important scenes were animated nicely. Now the characters dont even open their mouth properly while talking, or we only see their backs most of the time or some background shot while they are talking. I miss the 'acting' by the characters. Now they don't show much facial expressions. And so many white screens for the background!! Many more still shots than in the previous seasons. I miss the 'movement'. Like we dont see much of the whole 'winding up' part when Sawamura's pitching, just a close-up of him throwing, which is repeated for all his pitches. Its just manga images colored!!Why is there narration all the time? I hate that. Hasn't the character Yuuki left for university? Why is he narrating like an oracle or something. There was no narration in Act I. Instead of using characters to talk or act, they just use the narrator!!I keep rewatching Act I to feel the movement or see proper acting, and then I get bored or tired because I want to see the new scenes in Act II, but those are disappointing. So now I am stuck!!!!",5
ace-of-the-diamond,"I had my hesitations despite some recommendations to watch this show. However, I am so glad that I picked it up because it was exhilarating and rewarding. I am so impressed with the animation, humor, and camaraderie in this show. They did a great job bringing out emotions and being able to have so many characters play such an important role. I highly suggest watching this show! It seems like it will be a while before a third season could be released, but I really want it and will continue to watch this. This show has also made me want to start reading the manga, which isn't something that I do, just to continue on with this story. 10/10 would absolutely recommend.",3
ace-of-the-diamond,"I made a video: https://youtu.be/zPZvl4K0P-oVideo Script:Ace of the Diamond (8/10): Huzzah for rating systems, if you want to know more about my luxurious rating system check the description down below. Now it is about time I sprinted toe first into this review.I finally did it, I made it through all 126 episodes of Ace of the Diamond! Although I didn’t watch the recap episodes so it is a little less than that, but it was a long a heartfelt journey that I did not expect to be graced with. Most sports anime these days last around twenty five or fifty episodes so if a show is this long it had better be good and for the most part Ace of the Diamond is. This show has some of the highest highs I have ever gotten in sports anime and I can honestly say I actually enjoy watching baseball now where before I found it tedious and dreary. It does a great job of teaching the viewer the necessary information and then slowly adding layers of complexity. Making you appreciate every good pitch and clutch fielding play. There is also an assortment of matches that don’t involve the main team and that leads to some truly nail biting moments as I couldn’t guess who was going to pull out on top in those games, even the main team isn’t safe! This unpredictability helps to raise the stakes and build tension where other sports shows can feel like they have a pre-determined outcome. One of the shows greatest strengths is in how it makes the opposing teams feel real, and that they are people working together even though there are some stars. I found myself rooting for the opposing team after hearing some of their backstories. It makes you appreciate that everyone is giving it their all and I felt heartbroken a few times when the main team won because I had gotten so invested in the other team. While this could be seen as a weakness, as it takes quite awhile for the main team to be fleshed out, I really enjoyed the ride and the second season does a great job of making up for lost time. Now the show isn’t perfect, and the time between games can really drag the show to a less than stellar pace. I found myself setting the show down a few times when I was following it week to week because of those slower sections. They do have some touching character moments and build up drama for the upcoming games, but it can sometimes feel more like an excuse to give the animators a break than intentional pacing. If you are unsure as to whether you want to dive into the show, the first two episodes do a great job of building up excitement so I would watch those two and make your judgement. I’m sure this show isn’t for everyone but as a sports anime aficionado myself I found Ace of the Diamond to be a long ride worth taking.",3
ace-of-the-diamond,"For a few years now, I've heard others talking about Ace of Diamond. I couldn't get over my bias towards sports anime and avoided watching it. Man was I ever wrong. What can I say about this anime? Not only is it one of the best shounen I have ever seen, but in actuality, it is one of the best anime I have ever seen.Not only is the main character fleshed out, but all of his teammates (also the coach and mgmt. as well) are given an individual story that is fleshed out throughout the course of the series. Even the ancillary characters belonging to different schools are given their own unique personalities that really shine through both on and off the field. The attention to detail is very in depth and one of the best things about this show.It has all the best qualities of a very good shounen (a MC that never gives up, strong supporting characters, an emphasis on teamwork) that complement a sports series in the best possible way. A subtlety that really helps this anime is the music (score) that goes along with it. In addition, the opening theme through the first part of season 1 (even the last part) and the theme for season 2 (especially the last one) are both really well done. If I had one gripe it's that the main character is made to look weak at times and is overshadowed by his rival quite often. Though, I have to say this is a nice parallel to a genuine real life sports' story due to that fact. I have no hesitation in thinking that this will be resolved as the series goes on if/when it is renewed (hinging on how far the manga gets since it is only about 40 chapters in to the second Act)Bottom line: watch this anime. It's not only an awesome sports series, but a touching slice of life type as well. You will get caught up in the development of the first and second years, but also extremely touched by the relationship between the team/coach and the third years. The ending 10 minutes of Act 1 (season 2) are some of the most touching scenes I have seen in any form of media. I personally cannot wait for a season 3 whenever that may come. Do yourself a favor and find out why.",5
ace-of-the-diamond,"I love sport anime but I have my own preference. If Slam Dunk is the best basketball anime, Prince of Tennis is best tennis anime, Hungry Heart or Giant Killings is the best soccer anime, then Ace of the Diamond is the best baseball one. I have watched several baseball animes but none like Ace of Diamond can draw my attention throughout series and make me re-watch episodes. I even follow the manga. Hopefully, TokyoOne will continue Season 3 for this series after mangaka produces more chapters. I'm anxiously waiting for the official announcement.",5
ace-of-the-diamond,"Okay I'm gonna keep this review short by doing list of pros and cons:+Amazing animation+Great main character+Great soundtrack+Great characters+ Some intense and interesting games- Furyua- Some annoying characters- Some games keep dragging on- Kind of repetitive sometimes- This show should focus more on SawamuraTo sum it all up, this show has great MC, Sawamura, and you keep cheering for him through his hardships and failures. Animation is also great and I'm glad this series has been running this long and hope it will cover all of the manga. I prefer anime over manga when it's sports anime/manga.",5
ace-of-the-diamond,"Let me start this off by saying I am not a baseball fan at all. I only know the basics and this anime really teaches you about the sport. With the different types of pitches, callouts, plays, hand signs etc. I got hookedIt follows Sawamura as he gets recruited to join the Seidou high school baseball team, Sawamura has a southpaw pitching style and he wants to be the Ace of the team. Which is the number one pitcher on the team. I gotta say the struggle has never been more realer than in this anime. The amount of loss and heartbreak is staggering. They really don't pull any punches for Sawamura in this anime.He hardly ever shines in this and when he does shine its only for a few moments before the next episode where something bad happens. He has a rival pitcher on his team who throws really fast balls. There are times when you think he is the main character and not Sawamura because he's almost always shining. It gets frustrating at times because they do the main character so petty sometimes, but I guess they wanted to do a underdog story who has a lot of potential but will take a long time to reach his potential.All I can say is this isn't your typical good guy wins and gets awesome overnight anime. It kinda slaps you in the face with reality but I think Sawamura will be Ace one day. Its just a long journey. One thing though Sawamura has heart",5
ace-of-the-diamond,"The anime ace of diamond has a interesting depiction on high school baseball I could go on about how great this anime is but my favorite part of this anime is sawamura yes yes he's a lovable knuckle head but rather then that you watch and feel what he has been through , The coach said it well ""step by step"" this is true as sawamura has to endure all the challenges to get where he is he is not the incredibly cool super fast growing Mc but takes it slowly stating that hard work and motivation is all you need for your foundation",5
ace-of-the-diamond,I wanna kiss this anime and all the cute boys in it. I've sold my soul to previous sports animes but the dark lord lucifer has worked his magic in this 75 episode curse. I want to get off this ride but I can't. Have I mention I hate baseball bc I do but I love a good dang. I am converted. I love baseball. I feel my pants tightening every time I watch this anime. It's so good and I wanna kiss every hot tater tot in this show. Please end me.,5
ace-of-the-diamond,"Fun light entertainment to watch when stuck at home with a cold, but with so many episodes available to watch back to back on Crunchy Roll its clear this could be edited down a lot into something more impactful. Plenty of repeated scenes (e.g. original advert breaks) and overuse of basic effects for demonstrating character emotion like resolve or smouldering anger (look its the blue/red flame thing again, or glowing eyes!).Probably best enjoyed if you can ration yourself to one episode at a time?",5
ace-of-the-diamond,"Great characters and great story makes this a great show.  I love the enthusiasm of the main character Eijun Sawamura.  I love his relation ship with his team mates and his rivalry with Furuya.  It's never been a petty rivalry where the would do things to make the other look bad but instead drive each other to become better.  Seeing this team climb the ranks has been more enjoyable than teams like seirin (Kuroko's basketball) or Deimon (Eyeshield 21).  And what makes it better is so far there is no impossible techniques or things that wouldn't actually work in the real world.  Such as the Vanishing Drive (Kuroko), Kick Serve/ a third of Prince of Tennis's special hits, or the Devil Bat Ghost (Eyeshield 21) etc.",4.5
ace-of-the-diamond,this show had potential...  i really want to liek it.. but the writers have over done it for me. sure we all like the story of the underdog growing into something great... but he started pretty good...and the writers ground him to crap.... its been too long into this for him to recover IMO. even if they wait for the last moment for hime to shine... thier pace is waaay off... theres plenty of characters to like... and you wait for something to happen with this characters that have been built up only to be let down... I personally dont watch theese shows to think this is real life or I see how this could happen... I watch them to feel hgappy or excited and the writers have robbed me of that. Def has been put on the backburner for me,4.5
ace-of-the-diamond,"What the hell have the writers done to Sawamura? He is a shell of whatever pitcher/Man he used to be. He has gone from being (arguably) the main character to becoming one of the biggest side characters in Anime - earning himself a position next to Krillin and Yamcha from DBZ. If the writers were hoping to take Sawamura through some sort of rough patch in order to make it twice as epic when he finally does excel on the pitch - they have left it too long. Too long have i waited for Sawamura to step up to the plate both physically and mentally but to my utmost dissatisfaction no such moment has arrived. Is this the same guy who at the start of this anime roared out to the coach and the whole team that he would be the ace!? When was the last time you even heard him mention the word Ace since the start of the new season. Writers, I am disappointed and let down by how you have managed to turn a main character with so much potential into a pathetic and disappointing nervous wreck",4
ace-of-the-diamond,"I've really enjoyed watching AOD and put it firmly up there with my favorites! Why? It has a degree of balance that is lacking in other vocational/sport series that I've watched. The story and plot is underpinned by competition training and progress, so when there are moments of humor or confrontation it's sudden and potent. A strong lead character that isn't at the focus of everything is a nice touch, as we get to know around 70% of the first string in depth throughout. If you are an anime fan and didn't understand baseball before hand, but were curious, I can't think of a better way to learn the game!",5
ace-of-the-diamond,"I've never been a fan of baseball, but this show is more about the characters than the sport. The games they play are little more than a vehicle to drive personal and team development.That said, it is easy to get sucked into the action scenes. A few times I have gasped, or had my jaw drop when the players do something awesome. It does move a little slow at times, but I am usually excited for next week's episode as soon as the ED starts. I have kept up with it weekly, and will definitely continue to watch.",5
ace-of-the-diamond,This is a great shounen sports anime that is really good. At first look it might not seem to exciting but the story and character development is phenonemal and this show has the potential to be something great. One thing for sure is that it is always interesting and sucks you right in from the very first episode. This is one of the animes that has a lot of feels and emotions when it comes to passionate sports anime. Go watch now!,4
ace-of-the-diamond,"This is one of the best anime shows I have seen - and trust me - I have binged many, many shows. Character development that makes you love all of the characters, even the ones you initially hate. A story line that genuinely follows a story, one that is far more realistic than many Sports anime. It's comedic (and does it well) but focuses on the love of a sport I knew little about beforehand. Give it a chance, it really is a Home Run of a show.",5
ace-of-the-diamond,"I have never watched sports animes before until I tried Haikyuu. I loved Haikyuu so much that when I found this and it was simulcasting (plus the fact it had long seasons for 1 and 2) I immediately picked it up. It's so entertaining. Sometimes it can be frustrating watching the protagonist seem like a side character, but all the work he puts in and all the times his rival outshone him really make the moments he stands out in season 3 worth the entire wait. I can't wait for it to continue updating",2
ace-of-the-diamond,I have been watching anime for the past for years and this is by far one of the best sports anime i have ever seen the only ones that come close are ALL OUT and The Knight In The Area. and all those are very good shows. This is just a cut above the rest and has been one of my favourite anime for a long time would recommend for anyone who is new to anime or has been watching for years just good all around.,5
ace-of-the-diamond,"This show has a bit more realism to sports than other animes. In many instances, the team fails or does bad in games but it shows that it's a lot harder to build a great team that will always succed. It takes its time building the characters especially the main one but that's what makes you so proud when they finally succed after all that growth and struggle. I really didn't need to know baseball to be hooked on this show for it was and still is a wild ride that brings joy at every turn.",5
ace-of-the-diamond,The ACE OF DIAMOND is one the best anime where you could watch and wait on the excitement where the story process in a really cool way plus not rushing the main character to reach his goal in the slowest time yet the best way to build him up.its really good material plus not super hero pitches and the drama is there and the laough is there and the sadness there too.at6 the end its really super good and funny and excited to always watch and wait...,4
ace-of-the-diamond,"Spring 2018 I decided to finally follow a sport and fell in love with the NBA.  I decided to watch Kuroko and discovered that sports anime are an excellent portal into learning and loving a new sport.  Ace of the Diamond is no different.  It took about 2 episodes for me to be hooked.  I like the art style, the voice actors are great and the comedic relief made me actually laugh out loud.  I love this anime!",4.5
ace-of-the-diamond,"This anime is one of the best that are currently airing, and if you are looking for a sport anime that has the same thrilling, exciting, funny and sad effect like Ippo, then this is it!!!   I enjoy every chapter which is full of joy, you will learn a lot about baseball and all their technical details.  I truly recommend this anime to anyone who love sports, i am pretty sure you will enjoy it till the end.",4.5
ace-of-the-diamond,"Pros:-Good Baseball Anime with different storyline than your Major or Major 2nd.-Sawamura is a beast! Furuya too!- Lot of great baseball theory has well.- Teenager with manly voice ; For me this is a plus! I need me some weird 40 yo looking 16 yo in those Baseball anime!- Lots of character at first are basically their 3 liners with their distincts joke but at one point 2nd Arc, the newest season it became more a show about the team rather than the initial protagonist SawamuraIn my opinion and reading others opinions at the time it was arriving, it was taken with a certain understandable WTF? So in the sense, I feel it was part of a necessary  evolution if you're talking about how Team Work prevails.Also, may I add that this anime has very low amount of evil characters, in fact, this is something that I appreciated.For me there's only one big Elephant in the closet for this Anime and anybody binging this show can confirm it; The animation feels very great or extremely cheap.The short cut are little annoying visually speaking watching this anime feels like somebody is reading the Manga to you. I don't know if it's the CGI, the sequence length of those sometimes minutes wihout a single animation of character ""talking to themselves in the attendance and then back on a playing sitting and nobody, nothing moving thinking of the pitcher's who's about to pitch, then Still of face of Sawamura with internal dialog, then face of  Miyuki thinking and presenting to us what is the best call with a Suspense...So basically this scene is 1 minutes and this is 4 peoples talking to themselves and nothing but 5 to 6 still images are the scene, Then semi-focus, no-face Sawamura is pitching - Small cheap animation, Zoom on the ball with cool sound effect with ball in the glove with sometime batting animation, something just the zoom on where the ball is and the missed batting.So you went from having 1 minutes of No animation to that poorly executed cut corner Animation sequence. Then some locker, same things, juste still images after still images!MIX has nothing like that, I felt in opposition to AotD what little less traditional drawing style for 2019 but overall the animation sequence are super well executed, the flashy is less flashy, but I guess the abundance of amazing Baseball Anime gave us a lot of room to complain because they are easily in my  top 10 anime, period! Ace of the Diamond storyline is refreshing in the shounen style, and this particular sport, it makes sense to see more defeats so that type of Serie has lot of room for good Win/Lose Arcs with some rival team or new powerhouse etc...",5
ace-of-the-diamond,"I'm a pretty huge sports fan. My 2 hobbies are anime and sports. Baseball is probably one of my least favorites, especially to watch. However, this anime will most likely reign the best sports anime ever made.The story has been written absolutely wonderfully. I watch the games with so much passion. The connection I have with the players and the coaches is real. I recommend this anime to anyone who has an interest in sports. I killed 5 episodes a day at a minimum until now being caught up to the release episode each week.Hope they keep it going for a long time to follow the various characters ""careers"".",5
ace-of-the-diamond,"Love this show. Its not just a sports anime. It has that feel you get when you watch any other anime where they face one villain and take on the next. Every new team they face seems like a new story arc. What really draws me to this anime though is the character development you see taking place. It is fun to watch them grow with all the choices they make. I love that it is unpredictable. Usually an anime will signify when the hero is about to do something inspirational with some theme music, but in this show they do that..... and then break your heart lol. I also love the fact that when the pitchers learn a new pitch, it is used throughout the series. Not just some ultimate unique move that takes forever for the main character to learn and they only use once like in other anime. This show definitely needs more love and even if you are not a fan of sports anime I highly recommend you give it a try.",5
ace-of-the-diamond,"This show not only captures the essence of character development but does a good job of doing it. After having watched other sports anime I came across an issue that was prevalent in all of them, a poor MC. Ace of Diamond from the get go decides to avoid this by going down the path of proper and well flushed out character development. From early on Eijun's hidden ability is made clear however, it is not a godsend that enables him to be op from the beginning as seen in other sports anime. After declaring that he will become the best in typical shonen fashion, he is woken up by seeing not only how weak he is compared to the rest of his team but how strong others from around the region are as well. This sets him down the path of starting from zero and learning how to hone his ability to catch up to the others, his catch up is not done simply through a 3 episode training arc but rather throughout all of season 1, 2 and act 2. Learning valuable lessons through losses and from his teammates he is brought up in the best way possible as the creator has clearly taken his time in making Eijun a reliable and better player as the series goes on. While some rant about certain events that caused them to drop the show and complaining about his state in a certain part of the series, I doubt that they have even watched season 2 as all of the things holding him back as a character are resolved in season 2. This show also does not solely focus on the MC being the one to carry the team to victory but also allows the side characters to even be main characters at certain times. This allows for an overall well used cast followed by a nice story.",4
ace-of-the-diamond,"This series is one of a few different baseball anime series, but this one takes the cake as the most interesting and really tells the watcher what baseball is all about. I am not a baseball hype monster but I do really enjoy the characters and atmosphere that this show brings to the plate (pun intended). Each character in the show whether it be an enemy pitcher or another teammate, they all have a purpose. Just all in all, Ace of the Diamond is an amazing series with action at every corner and insane characters who will interest even the people who don't like baseball.",4
ace-of-the-diamond,"I'm not a fan of baseball, and watching the majors is pretty boring to me here in the states, but for some reason this anime makes baseball interesting. Not even the many movies we have on baseball here in the states make it as interesting as this anime did.Kudos to the writers for this anime. I feel like I have more of an appreciation for the game now and why so many people are fans of it. Funny how it took an anime for me to see that.I only knocked off one star because it could be ""Ace of Cliffhangers"" instead of ""Ace of Diamond"" and some parts did feel like they were stretched out longer than they should've been, but all in all it was good pacing and well written.I also have to give this anime credit for not going the usual route of making the main character over powered like we see in so many other anime. He literally starts from the absolute bottom and as he moves forward, we learn more about the other characters and also the characters from the other teams. There's a ton of world building with all the people around the main character and it feels the world keeps getting bigger the more the main character progresses.This is definitely worth a watch even if you don't like baseball.",5
ace-of-the-diamond,"This show is actually why I ended up paying for Crunchyroll! The characters in this highschool baseball anime are all so well rounded and written. The 2 ace pitchers Sawamura & Furuya are so different from one another (one a hardworking athlete, the other a naturally gifted one) yet their want to be the ace is played to great effect over the course of the series.As an example of how deep this anime is, the 2 titular pitchers aren't even the main character of the show! It's the catcher Miyuki! (watch it again if you didn't catch it!)This is one of my favorite animes of all time, and I can't speak enough about how great it is. This show had me on edge of my seat during the high tension moments, and had me rooting for a group of highschoolers trying to be the best team in Japan!",3
ace-of-the-diamond,"I first picked this series up two years ago when I was trying to get into the sports anime genre and I was quickly addicted. I stopped watching because the series wasn't complete and now with s2 at some 50 episodes, I've picked it up again. As a refresher I did re-pick up s1 starting at the game against Inashiro and it still made my heart pound, it still made me cry and scream and hold onto the edge of my seat, and I still love Sawamura, Miyuki, Haruichi, and really all our main players like I did thenCompared to other sports anime like Haikyuu and Kuroko, Daiya is really ""real time"". We see the players practice, all their games last a couple episodes but never feel drawn out, and we experience many roadblocks along the way. Things that are more technique oriented and sometimes things that are mentally exhausting (yips). The show does a good job at pacing things, but GOD the writing always has me thinking, will this be Sawamura's time to shine?I also feel like Daiya shows us some of those things that other sports anime don't. For example, what happens when the third years leave and trying to get a whole new team together while also moving directly into fall tournaments. Or the fact that some people may be on the team for so long and never get to play even when they try their best. The struggles that pitchers (in particular) face, especially during big competitionsI'm exciting to start watching s2 and picking up the manga (and fangirling on my blog)",5
ace-of-the-diamond,"I really went into this with little expectations but it far exceeded any ideas I had to be a great sports anime. Its all about struggle and hard work to discover your potential and to push your limits or expand your views. Sawamura plays sincerely and always tries to be better than before eventhough he falters sometimes, he pushes through to move forward one step at a time. I really enjoyed his journey especially with Miyuki. I think their battery was the best. Eventhough Furuya became ACE because of his natural talent (which kinda pissed me off), I think that he realized that he can't slack off because there is always someone right behind to take his place. Seeing other teams struggle and win or lose and how they grow was really exciting and intense. I often felt myself shaking with anticipation of what would happen. MORE MORE MORE! I could cry out for more. I felt the ending was ok but I am really hoping to see another season where Sawamura becomes ACE and improves even more! I absolutely love how he is honest and cheers for everyone, eventhough he is often he comic relief in the anime, he is obviously giving his all so you must cheer for him more. All the characters on Seido's team make you root for them so loud that it becomes deafening. I am so glad to have watched this I just want more! Call me greedy.",3
ace-of-the-diamond,"This show is really good at making you like and care about the characters, even ones who just appear in one game. There were a few arcs I wasn't expecting to care about, but within an episode they pulled me in. It's also light for the most part, with the most drama being a character getting injured (not seriously, just enough to call into question whether they can give 100%). Explains enough about the game so non-fans like me can follow. So the show is fun, like real baseball is supposed to be but isn't. Lots of cute boys, too",2
ace-of-the-diamond,"Yes Haikyuu has all the love and hype (and rightly deserves it), but AoD and Baby Steps imo are the best sports anime of recent.The characters in this series are so good and unlike almost every sports series ever, the main character is NOT vital to the success of the team right away, so he has to himself vital, and the process and story of that is part of what makes AoD so great.The characters are also amazing. They start of mundane and pretty normal, no outstanding designs with the exception of the Kominato bros and their pink hair, but as you get to know them, you love them for every ounce of their being.This series is so fricking grand man, please watch and love it.",4.5
ace-of-the-diamond,"This is really fun to watch but it's still way way way w...'flashback scene to me wishing I could see how a game would conclude before needing to leave for class but not having enough time'...ay too drawn out. Also I wish it didn't have so many recaps (though personally, I'll never get recaps. to me they're only used either because the writer doesn't have enough content to fill the allotted number of episodes or as an insult to the viewers intelligence). Both of those issues are particularly bad during actual games. I'm still extremely glad I found this anime. I only started it because I enjoyed Haikyu and wondered if I only liked that anime because I never followed or played organized volleyball. Not a huge shock but I love this even though I'm already a big fan of baseball (go Cubs) and have played it myself for a really long time.Pros:-huge number of quality character (takes a lot of time to develop teammates and opponents)-generally a blast to watch-extremely motivated and funny MC (his commentary on the games and players may be my favorite part of this anime)Cons:-drawn out during games (I started skipping some bits of games in the second season)-recaps for days (cut them out and I don't think this would even make it to the 100 episode mark)-the writer, to the point of becoming predictable, loves to crush the MC (gives lots of room for character growth but it had me cursing the writer at times. also, the MC almost seems like a side character often)",4.5
ace-of-the-diamond,"When I first started watching this anime, my knowledge of the sport was that it was boring and takes forever. This anime has taught me the rules and positions of Baseball as well as why its so exciting! I have been a fan of baseball since! It is also just a great story of a young pitcher with so much potential and motivation to succeed but not much training. The further I got along the more I learned about baseball and the more I fell in love with all the characters. I feel like as my love for the sport grew, so did Sawamura and his team. Just great great stuff.Favorite quote ""nice ball"" lol",5
ace-of-the-diamond,"Ace of diamond is a must watch anime who really catches your eye with its great graphical image along with exciting music. Although the reason for why it is such a great anime is the reason that expresses real life baseball and real life obstacles in which we have to overcome. For example Sawamura the main character had to develop a strong fighting spirit in order to make the 1st string team and become the future ace. Also teamwork and friendship is a big part of this anime as in every sport you can't win by yourself just in Ace of Diamond everyone contributes for the teams success like the Sawamura-Miyuki. Ace of diamond also gives a message that you must be mentally tough and should never give up into going to the next level. This reflects and benefits each individual who dreams to be the best as competition is fierce in this growing world where we all want to be the ace or the best, or the king or anything where we dream. Especially in the sports world you must be prepared to fight it all out. In conclusion I would like to state that this anime really motivates you to chase your dream and live your life through tough times and also to work hard.",5
ace-of-the-diamond,"I honestly started watching this show on a whim. At first I didn't like it but stuck through the first episode since I love baseball. As the anime progress I fell more and more in love with it!! The characters and the story plot is amazing! Literally watched it all within a month (would take me a shorter time if I was not in school xD). Overall, I loved it!!! It was so amazing!! Was sad to find out it ended. I hope they continue the story in the future. Now time to read the manga lol",5
ace-of-the-diamond,"I've never really got interested in baseball at all...that is until I clicked the first episode of Diamond no Ace. The main character is very unique and so are all the other characters which made me love all of them...well with the exception of a few. The games are super intense and I fangirl quite a lot as well as screaming and yelling so loud while watching this making my mom question me. I've never been a fan of baseball but because of this anime, I can say I'm quite a genius on the rules of baseball. I swear you won't get bored of this anime LOL XD",5
ace-of-the-diamond,"Even baseball is not the most popular sport on the globe,Ace of the Diamond has the power to make you embrace it.It is a story that show us that dreams come true,but with a little luck and only with a lot of hard-work.It has characters that are permanently in development,but remain in realistic plain,none of the characters is perfect so everyone must trust the others to overcome their flows.A simple,but beautiful show that teaches us about baseball,sportsmanship,dedication,teamwork combining action with a bit of comedy.P.S. Sawamura is the best",5
ace-of-the-diamond,"http://www.rokthereaper.com/2015/04/ace-of-diamond-season-1-anime-review.htmlClick the above link to view the full, detailed anime review for Ace of Diamond: Season 1 on RoKtheReaper.com.  You will, however, find my verdict below.""Ace of Diamond is one of my favorite anime of 2014.  I absolutely loved every aspect of this series and how they go so in-depth with what baseball is all about.  I loved the character development, the diversity in the characters, and the levels of baseball they portrayed as far as how teams played comparatively.  They do their best to make every interaction exciting and that every match-up would present its own challenges, and each team that Seido faces boasts its own strengths.  While I felt like somethings were dragged out longer than they needed to, nothing really felt like much of a filler (Seido's final game kind of did in some parts, however).  I feel like everything flowed pretty smoothly until the end, and I feel like everyone, opponents included, were represented well.This anime also gives out enough knowledge that those who do not know anything about baseball would be able to learn along the way in order to truly enjoy the plays made in the anime and could transfer that into the real world.  By the end of the anime you know exactly what they meant as far as positions, such as the ""Three-Hole"", ""Clean Up"", or ""Lead Off"", you even know what different pictures are, such as the ""Cutter"", ""Change-Up"", or ""Knuckle Ball"".This anime is something I would recommend for anyone who likes sports anime, but also likes anime that focuses upon friendship, growth, and adaptation to harsh situations.  I think anyone who gave this anime a chance would be instantly drawn into it, and that they would find each of the characters enjoyable in their own ways.  I am anxiously awaiting for season 2!""",5
ace-of-the-diamond,"I was seventeen when I first discovered this anime; I wasn't a baseball fan and didn't know anything about the sport other than the pitcher and bases. It was about March of 2014, my Junior year of high school, and I was browsing anime to watch and this came up. I love sports anime and so I gave it a chance and fell in love with Sawamura Eijun's character; hot-headed, determined, and those eyes! *_* I stuck around because I liked this kid and knew he was gonna go far in this anime. I watched as many episodes as I could, when I came home from school, and was so upset when I found out I had reached the end of all the episodes they had out so far. I didn't want to pick up the manga yet because I was still getting to know everyone and getting attached to them and had a feeling the spoilers would hurt my heart. I learned so much from watching this anime from the positions, scoring, innings, types of pitchers, batters...etc...and i'm so glad I found this anime. I recommend this anime to everyone looking for a new sports anime to watch. The characters are all so likable   and differ from one another drastically. 10/10 would marathon this all over again.",5
ace-of-the-diamond,"Whether you're a fan of the sport or not, this is a great series. Fans of the game will nod in appreciation as they keep the sport as close to reality as possible, all the while non-fans will learn the basics of the game quite easily. The character development is fantastic albeit sometimes slow to process. Same goes with the story as one game can take up several episodes, but that is to be expected in most animes. However, you won't be able to deny the emotional attachment you will feel to some of the characters. All in all, this is a breath of fresh air and allows you to step away from the worlds of magic and fantasy. This is as close to real life as it gets...and it'll get you hooked in no time!",5
ace-of-the-diamond,"This series combines everything thats great about sports anime and everything thats great about watching baseball as a fan. It has overpowered sempais, a main character with a specific skill, and winning through teamwork/friendship. It is very accurate and technical to actual baseball. I can't speak to how well it explains the sport to a layperson, but as a fan it has the same drama of watching the sport with the clutch hitting opportunities or extremely high pressure pitching situations. this anime got me back into watching professional baseball (go dodgers!). I highly recommend this to anyone who likes sport anime or is a fan of baseball in general",5
ace-of-the-diamond,"I don't watch sports anime too often, one because they tend to drag things on forever, two because everything seems so cliché... but with this show there are realistic expectations of every player a coach who is wicked at his job and believes in his players, and a great support system going. It is sad to know he's quitting on his team but that can't be helped it is how harsh the world is if you don't produce wins you just leave that or they fire you....anyway far as sports anime goes I was interested enough to watch the first season and intend to watch the second season so for me it is quality work. The characters aren't too strong or too weak everyone has room to grow and lessons to learn, it truly depicts the struggles athletes face without going over the top. I haven't seen an anime like this in a while one that has me invested in the players abilities and wanting to see how they conquer each obstacle in their way. Definitely worth my time!",5
ace-of-the-diamond,"I can't write big paragraph but i'll tell you why I love this show. I love how the main character, Eijun, is trying his hardest to become the ace of the baseball team. The anime shows friendship, determination, how they deal with when they lose a match. Ugh, I just really love how this story is portrayed and how the pace it's going because it feels like I'm watching the whole team (and the others school teams) grow.",4.5
ace-of-the-diamond,"I read the manga up to 265 (its up to like 380 but chapters 266-current have a lot of skips-still waiting on the new scanlation team to fill in the gaps!) and was delighted to see that this anime was so successful and season 1 ended pretty close to chapter 265. I feared that it would just get 25 episodes but not only did it go up to 75 episodes but season 2 is up and coming?? MUST WATCH NOW!!! There is just something special about baseball anime/manga that make me prefer it to other sports, and this does not disappoint!",4.5
fategrand-order-absolute-demonic-front-babylonia,"IIRC, I remember reading somewhere that Funimation has streaming rights for a month(?), so it probably wont get released to Crunchyroll until then. Funimation releases the episodes weekly anyways, though you'll be an episode behind the premium users(nothing new). In terms of content and animation though, I can only say this: I now know where the money whales spend went.  Honestly really good animation(bit excessive on fanservice, but whatever) and I'm really excited to see a certain blonde Rin face show up soon.",4.5
fategrand-order-absolute-demonic-front-babylonia,"Note: To avoid confusion, there is a short one hour movie that serves as a prequel to this anime, Fate Grand Order: First Order; it's available on Crunchyroll. While episode 0 of this anime is a prequel to the movie. Episode 0 -> Movie -> Episode 2 onwards of this anime, that's the chronological order of this Fate route. Also, keep in mind that Fumination has streaming rights of this anime for a month, so non-fumination users have to wait like a month or so for a new episode. With that out of the way, Fate Babylonia is an anime adaption of the mobile phone game Fate Grand Order. In the year 2017 CE a destructive singularity fully developed due to a strange turn of events that happened during the Holy Grail War in 2004. The Chaldea organization is tasked to develop new masters so they, along with their servants, can destroy the singularity that will bring the extinction of mankind. It is not completely necessary to play the game to understand this plot but it will help you understand more about the lore, character backgrounds, etc. The game is divided into 7 chapters/routes so to speak and this anime follows the 7th chapter exclusively but with some light references to the other 6. As for how it holds up as a entry to this franchise, it's a worthy one. Every element you expect from the Fate series is here: Flashy and high octane action fights with dazzling effects, smooth animation, enjoyable characters, easy to follow plot, appropriate pacing, great art style, gender swapping of historical figures, light waifu material, and so on. As a fan of this series, I wholeheartedly recommend any followers of the Fate franchise to give this anime a watch; and of course to those that aren't to use this one as a starting point to a series regarded as one of the best action anime out there.",5
fategrand-order-absolute-demonic-front-babylonia,"I'm afraid that I didn't like this particular series.Gilgamesh spends his time doing nothing, recruiting people that he easily defeats, and saying that he can't defeat people that he seems to have no trouble against. At least in Fate/Zero there was the excuse that he was a servant so he had to obey commands from idiots.The main character is annoying, as it has been in almost every series apart from Fate/Zero. He spends his time shocked at some display of power, and is completely useless.The villains purposefully don't attack the hero's, it's only in episode 8 that a main villain decides to attack the wall and she destroys it in one hit. There's no reason given for why it wasn't done before.And finally this feels like they are trying to be kid friendly by making everything bloodless (or close enough), and nobody dying. I mean in the 8th episode a villain gets a hero in her jaws, and just drops it on the floor by the other hero's when she's clearly still alive. I've finished 8th episode now, and only one person has died, when the 3 deities could have probably killed everyone who opposed them by now (they should have killed the main character in episode 1, would have made it much better).It all feels pointless in this show.",5
didnt-i-say-to-make-my-abilities-average-in-the-next-life,"I have the books for this, I own all of them and have the next pre-ordered so when i saw this on the roster for the anime season I was excited.  My expectations are completely trashed. Whatever this crap is this is not the same story that was in the book. The story does not begin when she is Mile, that little episode of kids being kidnapped did not happen. She did not meet her party members in this way and they completely wrote out her entire experience as Adele and her first set of friends. The entire reason she is running as ""Mile"" and became a hunter if the first place is just not there. So at best they will have maybe a 15 second flashback of what is the entirety of book 1.  I'm just so completely shocked at how completely and utterly off base they are. And the little nano cat? Seriously that character does not exist at all in the book.  If I was the author I would of red lighted this crap from the start.",3.5
didnt-i-say-to-make-my-abilities-average-in-the-next-life,"With the Isekai boom, a lot Isekai's can fall into several categories. Some Isekais like That Time I got Reincarnated as a Slime or Konosuba are incredibly memorable and hilarious shows. Some Isekais have an awesome twist to them like Overlord and Re:Zero. And then there's some Isekai's which are... pretty average. I typically like these average Isekais, but they're not on the top of my recommendation list. Unfortunately, this anime is one of those average Isekais. After watching the first episode, I can say that it's not a bad anime by far, but it's not up there either. Thankfully after watching Isekai Cheat Magician (the most painfully average Isekai I've ever watched), I get a better impression of every other Isekai. This one thankfully stands out a little more than some of the other Isekai's because it's one of the first Isekai's that has an all-female team - and that's finally including the protagonist (about time). The Isekai is definitely self-aware by going through the reincarnation backstory quite quickly, and the main character even called her own death experience a typical ""Isekai Trope"". One of the aspects of this anime that makes this slightly ""meh"" is its pacing. It's not awful, but there are times where I go ""that could have been done differently"". For example, near the end of the episode during the climax of the protagonist's power, the typical ""magical invisible pet"" character suddenly interrupts and gives an explanation, which completely destroys the mood of the overall scene. I usually expect overpowered-explanations in the second episode of an anime. When it's explained too soon in the first episode, there's not much to look forward to in the second episode because most of us can sort of see where the show is going from here now despite knowing nothing about the plot. Also... I CANNOT write this review without mentioning that magical-cat character's voice. It completely caught me off guard in a negative way honestly. I saw the cat and was like ""Oo it's another high-pitched fun magical pet character like Puck in Re:Zero!"" but NOPE! The cat has a male-baritone-level voice that did not fit his overall design at all in my personal opinion. There were some parts where the background looked painted and I honestly respected that. I'm not much of an analyzer of images, art styles, animation styles and such, so I don't have much to say about that. Overall, I'm looking forward to this and hope that it goes somewhere more. It's definitely not on the top of my list, but it's just one of those Isekai's that you can just enjoy every week. I'm glad they're going for an all-female cast in an Isekai, as most of the time, every Isekai nowadays is just a harem, which has gotten quite old, so this is a nice change of pace!",1
didnt-i-say-to-make-my-abilities-average-in-the-next-life,"Hadn't heard or read anything about it and each episode I find fun and humorous. I don't take anime as seriously as most, so I can get a kick out of shows more than those that have to compare every new show to one from the past or having to break it down to complain about minute details. Fun for me, might not be for you, but you won't know until you give it a shot. Don't let anyone else's review keep you from trying new things.",5
didnt-i-say-to-make-my-abilities-average-in-the-next-life,"Basically a cute girls doing cute things anime got isekai-ed and some fourth wall breaks were thrown in. A breath of fresh air when compared with all the generic isekai anime from the same year. It might not be what the fans of the LN wanted, but it’s still worth a look. My enjoyment has increased with each new episode, so my score might go up.Edit: dang, the show definitely got dark at times, but on the whole its core cute/funness remained intact. Bit cheeky that they saved all of the main character’s growth for he season finale, but it got me excited about the idea of a second season... so mission accomplished? You can feel the budget constraints, but it doesn’t suffer for it as much as some other shows do.I stand by the 3 stars I gave this initially. If I could give it a more granular rating I’d say it’s a 7/10 for the enjoyment it gave me.",4
didnt-i-say-to-make-my-abilities-average-in-the-next-life,"This show seems to nail the average, but if you like Yuri and moe, this could be one of your favorites this season. Reading some other reviews it seems some people did give it 5 stars simply for having female leads. If you're one of those people, cool, disregard the following and enjoy the show!The usual premise of an isekai is; an outcast in our world *hand waving accident/portal/thing/truck happens* gets transported or reborn in another world. They gain massive power or popularity, or both, and set out to fix something in that world only their power or character can fix.In contrast this show is all about the selfish desire of the protagonist Mile. She apparently had perfect As in high school so she felt her peers shy away from her. But, her life was cut short, so a god granted her a do-over in another world. The thing is, gods don't listen well, so when she demanded to be average as her boon, the god thought average among all, not only mere humans. So the god made her average, but way overpowered for a human.That's the sort of humor you can expect from the show. Also the supossedly extremely busty friend has some very weird size changing boobs, but I'll chalk that one up to bad animation. Yes, the animation is inconsistent so the joke fell flat. Honestly I'm cutting the show a break since it's the first episode, but that animation will probably sink the show for me. I will be back editing this review if the animation is still inconsistent. Also I am not happy they made me spend so much time thinking about an underage girl's bust size. The layered CGI looks on point, and I like the colors. As far as premise and animation, I think the show needs more. I'm staying hopeful because I see a lot of fans of the LNs being enthusiastic. Some are dissatisfied with the anime having skipped book one, but I think that's why we get a narration cat! I like animal characters done right, and this one is. No annoying voice here! And he sticks to one scene for explanations, rather than having to pause at every other scene for background. The story can really pick up, or be a complete let down. I hope the theme of this being about Mile finding a normal life evolves to something substantial.The backstory and motive of Mile is very boring, literally a Mary Sue complaining about being a Mary Sue. ""First world problems,"" sums up her character. Sad really, it kills my interest in the show. If the rest of the episodes are of her crying over being powerful, I'll take off all stars. I don't need to hear the whining of a person who literally has everything at her fingertips.",5
didnt-i-say-to-make-my-abilities-average-in-the-next-life,"Alright people, yes I have read the light novel, no that is not why I think this is a horrible anime but I will compare the two since the novel is the source of this adaptation. (made it to episode 5 before giving up feel free to message me in the event you get further than I did and think these things got fixed)Characters  They use the same four characters, and don't introduce any other reoccurring characters in the arcs, ""well it's kinda short and it episodic, not arc based."" It never should have been episodic this had more than enough material for at least 24 episodes, maybe fifty depending on creative liberties. This is just before taking a break or maybe introducing some filler arcs. So why are there only four characters? The only thing I can think of is that they wanted to pay as few voice actors as possible so they sat down and said these four are the main group so that's all we need. I also think this is why they skipped Mile's entire first arc. Which is a real shame cause even though they only stick around for an arc or two there we some interesting and likable characters that popped up.Speaking of Mile they turned her into a standard trope character I don't know why they also did it, it's note like they even had to write in depth, she already had some from the novel not anything ground breaking but enough to make her feel like a character as opposed to this..... thing. (they also simplified the others and dulled down the interactions between all 3 as well)Art It's bad, Mile laser is the only thing I have seen that looked remotely nice,everything else is just average or below, the flames in episode 3 are a joke and I am not even going to talk about fight calligraphy, they clearly didn't. I'm not expecting unlimited blade works here or anything this is just sloppy it's sad. The art is literally described by the backgrounds, you will know what I mean.Music honestly, nothing stood out, In the half hour or so between watching 5 epiosdes and writing this I have forgotten the opening and endings tracks and cannot think of a nice  OST that played not saying they are bad, literally mind is blank I remember dialogue, no music.On it's own? As a stand alone comedy it barely passes. if you want references/parody Combat Butler does that type of humor way better. In terms of raw comedy take your pick Snafu, reincarnated as a slime, I could make a list but just pick a anime and you can feel safe that it is probably better than this. As for an Isekai this is bad, like really bad even for an isekai, no discovery, not even anything for the power trip since the art is so bad, no real shock to observe since Mile unlike her light novel self has some real issues holding back at all.and if you were looking for story well, they sadly scrapped or ignored almost all of it. No feels here either. Ending statement (my god I am a nerd) Hopefully you can see why I believe they cheaped out on this anime in terms of costs but hey if it gets better or if you feel like you can convince me to give it another shot, feel free. I like seeing what people have to say even if they don't agree. Just keep in mind Mile being cute isn't a good reason, I have the novel for that haha.P.s they rushed it so fast, I have no idea why, yes there are some cool things that happen later on but with things as they are I would't care about them by the time they got around to it.",3
didnt-i-say-to-make-my-abilities-average-in-the-next-life,"What can I say? I barely write reviews for anime unless I know they deserve an extra 5 stars. On the comedy level of Konosuba with tons of references from different anime, this show has sparked an interest which I don't think will die down easily. For one, you barely see isekai anime with a female lead, so this is 100% refreshing. Great character development as well!As I've read other reviews I've noticed that this anime adaptation is not the same as the light novel. The anime has added in plot points and characters, even involving the pre-story to the anime. But for someone who usually exposes themselves to stories like these anime only, I don't find any problems with this. I find the added material adds to the comedy. People should overlook the fact that this is not a 1 for 1, but instead a completely different recreation which probably works better video wise compared to book wise.",5
didnt-i-say-to-make-my-abilities-average-in-the-next-life,"This anime is as average as it can be, with some fourth wall breaking elements, where the main character is kinda self aware of isekai tropes,she's basically over powered, because in the world she's  ""average"" which  is equal to that of a dragon or something like that, soo, yeah, basically she got the opposite of what she asked for, such as Ascendance for a bookworm when they wanted to read books in their next life  but got the opposite instead, theirs some comedy too this show as well, but it kinda gives off a Konosuba vibe, sort of with its quacky situations, and events that happen, by the way, the fourth wall is broken like multiple times. Too many times in my opinion, but it is what it is, anyways the show is an alright average Isekai anime where you can just turn your brain off and watch it for fun, this is the kind of anime you go to watch when you have nothing else to watch, the main character also appears to get excited when certain isekai ""stuff"" happens etc, but she's basically in a fantasy medieval world but yeah, the shows alright for what it is. Nothing to crazy either.",4
didnt-i-say-to-make-my-abilities-average-in-the-next-life,"Yeah, so I’ve only seen episode one at the time of writing this review, and I’d say as someone who has never had any other experience with this story in any other medium that it was good enough to watch for what it was. Nothing amazing, and nothing awful. I will say that the soundtrack goes pretty hard and there’s a lot of extra frames that you usually wouldn’t see in something more low-budget. The only colossal no no that I saw was when they STOPPED WHAT WAS GOING ON TO HAVE A SIDE CHARACTER MONOLOGUE. You just can’t do that. So yeah 3/5 is where it stands for now, if it looks interesting to you then give it a try, if not I’d move on because I don’t expect it to change from the fluff that it presents itself as. I will update this after I finish watching the entirety of season 1. Thanks for reading.",5
didnt-i-say-to-make-my-abilities-average-in-the-next-life,"Alright boys and girls, you ready? My rating isn't based on story, art, character design, none of that. Now, I understand that it's more original to have an all female cast for an anime, especially nowadays, but the yip yappin' of the little Japanese female chihuahua voices induced a headache not even half way through the first episode. That's my problem with all female casts--there's no balance between mid-high female to low-mid male voices, so now it's just 25 minutes of constant,  and I mean constant, high-pitched ear blasting that sounds like the continuous yap yap yapping of a pack of chihuahuas. For me, the headache I get halfway through kind of takes away any ability for me to judge anything else, so this is my rating.",3
didnt-i-say-to-make-my-abilities-average-in-the-next-life,"so many people are giving this a bad review because its a 'trash adaption' which i think is ridiculous. i have never read the novels but i found this anime so to be very amusing and cute. its different and quirky, if you like that kind of stuff i highly recommend thisdon't listen to the novel readers trying to put this down. its funny and the animation is well done! give it a chance i promise you'll like it <3",3

YesWould I recommend this show to anyone? Probably notWhile it took me more episodes then I usually give shows to interest me (So few shows I'm watching this season has lead me to give slow shows more episodes then I normally would), I found some enjoyment in the show in the end. It is a little silly at times and could take itself more seriously, but those moments of seriousness and backstory and character development made this not a waste to watch.If it got a second season, I would watch it, but I would not particularly recommend this show to anyone.

didnt-i-say-to-make-my-abilities-average-in-the-next-life,"I have enjoyed this show very much. I have liked Mile  the QT, MC (also known as Kurihara Misato <3), from the start. She has a good mix of OP Stats, Overall Cuteness & Good Sense of Humor. Has everything Isekai needs. Mages, Cute Girls & Good Laughs. Not to mention a pretty decent story. Which seems pretty unique for a Isekai type imo. Not that I'm saying every other Isekai is the same. (Fun-Police will state otherwise). Also... The expressions the MC's make in this show are always great too. Side note:Picked up the manga pretty recently, and it is somewhat different but still just as enjoyable. I feel like I have gotten more insight on the story overall by watching the anime & reading manga (Still have more of both). I see others saying its not like the LN, not really my concern there either way. It's a source I haven't tapped into yet. Anyway. Point being, I have enjoyed this very much. It has supplied me with many laughs without fail. Looking forward to next Monday :)Recommended",3.5
didnt-i-say-to-make-my-abilities-average-in-the-next-life,"I dont really see any problem with the story. Some people are mad at it for not following the light novel, but I think that is the main theme of this story. And, either way it is actually a pretty good anime.Yes, it is a generic isekai OP MC.

It’s definitely worth the try if you hadn’t already and if you watch the first one or two episodes and hate it, then at least you tried to watch it.",5
didnt-i-say-to-make-my-abilities-average-in-the-next-life,"The problem with these animes and the stories that make them up is always some character that is reincarnated that is apparently SO stupid they can't even use their skills in the most obvious of ways. With her level of magic, she could have easily done a TON of things more efficiently. Considering she can make up magic on the spot of ""create this stupid spikey thing"" why not ""place a strong, long-lasting barrier on the entire carriage/s so that no on dies while I'm off being a stupid tourist."" It just makes the story fall flat when you realize how purposefully dumb the author makes their characters.",3
didnt-i-say-to-make-my-abilities-average-in-the-next-life,As someone who has read the source material this is hard to review.   I can actually see why many people reviewed it so poorly.   It completely deviates from the source material in a massive way to the point where outside of the basic premise and the character names there is very little in common.  It literally ignored the entire first book.    That said it also captures the spirit of the source material perfectly.    If I rate it as a stand alone anime I would have to give it 5 stars because the show itself is great.   If I had to rate it based off the source material I would have to give it a 1 at best.   The initial 3 episode arc and the graduation battle was not nearly as good as the book though but still one of the best shows of the season.,4
didnt-i-say-to-make-my-abilities-average-in-the-next-life,"so I don't care that it's not faithful to the series. Aside from the moe-ness of the characters, I love the show. If you've watched any other isekai you'll see just about every trope (mostly to be made fun of).The MC is easily my favorite part of the show. Shes's basically what would happen if you took Aqua and gave her the powers of Rimuru. Anyway, I've watched every episode there is right now, which is only 3, and I'm in love with the show. Can't wait to watch what happens next.",3
didnt-i-say-to-make-my-abilities-average-in-the-next-life,"Thought I would chime in since this is getting such negative reviews. I actually find this series to be a lot of fun. It is very tongue in cheek about the fact that it is an isekai in the golden age of way too many isekai.  Our MC Misato constantly finds unique ways to parody & pay homage to all kinds of OG characters ranging from Dragon Ball's Master Roshi to everyone's favorite isekai waifu Truck-kun. This show might not be out winning awards for best animation any time soon, but if you are feeling like sitting down for some chill fun & wholesome vibes. This is a good show to watch.",2
didnt-i-say-to-make-my-abilities-average-in-the-next-life,"This has potential as an anime, and it’s not all that bad on its own. If you haven’t read the manga/light novels then it’s not that bad. Cliche, yes but not too bad. If you’ve read the manga or light novels, I’m truly sorry. Keep expectations veeeery low, and watch it as it’s own story, because it really failed adaptation-wise. I really love the LNs of this series, and greatly anticipated an anime. I hate leaving a bad review especially so early on but it really is more like an AU of the LN or fanfiction with so much missing. It completely skips basically the entire first book, and feels rushed and hastily put together with arcs not even canon to the LNs, removing important characters, almost none of Mile’s backstory except for the thirty-second recap that didn’t clear much up if the viewer didn’t read the LNs and misses absolutely crucial moments and plot points in the story, and doesn’t capture the character’s personalities well. It does have funny gags and memes, which makes it a bit funnier, but characters that were originally unique and funny are now just cardboard cutouts of other isekai protagonists that are just kinda dumb jokes. This is shown in things like the Nanobots. In the books, Nanobots are incredibly robotic but still have emotion and are just a funny character similar to the great sage in That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime, and they have rare but hilarious interactions with Mile. That got replaced with a Puck-like cat thing that follows Mile around constantly as a sort of way to explain what’s happening because there was no backstory or original explanation. It just feels like someone skimmed the Wikipedia page at 2 AM and scribbled down a couple things and gave it to the development team. I am, essentially, disappointed in the adaptation. It’s a classic rendition of a book into a film; It should really just be it’s own story and not hold the name of a series that it’s not following the plot of. Otherwise, it’s an alright fanfic that people who are new to the series can enjoy. Just if viewers that watch this want to read the LNs, be prepared for a VERY different story off the bat.",3
didnt-i-say-to-make-my-abilities-average-in-the-next-life,Most of the negativity comes from the crowd of people who think it needs to be a straight adaption so I would suggest ignoring them. As the story currently is its going great 2 episodes Its a relaxer anime really something to give you a smile. Its not a as action packed as some series like this and despite my first thought about this being a pandering to girls series well I was wrong its not going for anything it just wants to be its own thing.,5
didnt-i-say-to-make-my-abilities-average-in-the-next-life,"The light novels are some of my favorites, and this certainly is being told in a different way, but from all the reviews they didn't pay attention to the end credits. It clearly shows the trio that she bonded with early in the novels, I am assuming they are going to consistently have flashbacks filling in the story up to the hunter school. I am so looking forward to this as I love the novels. Hopefully they don't wonder to far outside of the novels cause there is really great story there. People should really give it some time, it's got a lot they need to cover if they are starting at the hunter school. I am sure people will fall in love as it goes on as there is a ton of story in this series that that haven't even started to share in this first episode.",3
didnt-i-say-to-make-my-abilities-average-in-the-next-life,"Honestly, there have been other reviewers to post this as well.  This adaptation from the Light Novels is barely comparable. The whole plot that you get from the light novels doesn't even exist here.  Yes, it is an actual story, with actual plot, actual threat, real situations that would make you wonder about your choice.  I don't like where they chose to Start with episode 1, they skipped so much, even with the flash back, you don't know anything.  They should have start with volume 1 page 1, instead of volume 3 (or 4) at page 50.  I really like the author and support their work, but this animation of said novels is not even a homage. *sadface*",4
didnt-i-say-to-make-my-abilities-average-in-the-next-life,"Very unexpectedly fun series. It starts out very quick to where the joke timings are off. However, around episode 3, it's like they figured out how to pace everything and the anime picks up steam. I thought it was going to be a gag anime, but later starts getting serious.I might not find quite a few of the jokes they make that funny, and there are tons of Japanese cultural references, however, the story is good to where it stands by itself without the jokes. The story is pretty solid and it's been very fun. It's also a 12 series, so has the pros and cons of one (I just finished episode 8 before writing this review)",3.5

The art is bright and colorful, the music is fantastic and this show easily is one of the best of the season!If you're looking for a straight adaptation of books you've read, maybe give this a pass - judging from others' reactions.

Seemed to jump around a lot to the point there was no real clear way to end the anime. Good example of what to do with anime like this is look at ""Welcome to Demon School!

didnt-i-say-to-make-my-abilities-average-in-the-next-life,"Misato Kurihara was an exceptional youth, standing above her peers in school, yet she never had friends nor her idea of a regular life. That all changed when she died though, in more ways than one. After dying, she actually awoke again, reincarnated in another world as Adele von Ascham. A chance at another life, a chance at an average life, this is what she dreamed of. However, her dying wish to be a girl with average abilities in the next life was taken a little too literally. Instead of being ""average"" she was reborn to have average abilities of all the living beings in her new world. In other worlds, she is in the middle of the food chain, in a fantasy world where humanity at its best could only dream to be in the middle of a food chain involving magical beasts. Misato under the alias ""Mile"" will continue to chase her simple dreams, even in the face of crazy situations.Didn't I Say to Make My Abilities Average in the Next Life?! is an isekai adventure comedy, with very ""average"" entertainment value. While the anime itself is incredibly similar to an anime like this year's (2019) Endro, Endro had a distinctly cute moe style, and a charming playfulness to it's comedy and script. Not to say that it's fall season counterpart (this anime) doesn't have it's own tricks up it's sleeve as a comedy adventure. Average in the Next Life's best comedy came from Mile's inability to be discrete about her reincarnation, constantly quoting or making references to otaku culture. On its own that probably doesn't sound stand out, but when Mile ends up getting her traveling companions mixed up in her otaku shenanigans is where it gets good. Seeing people who wouldn't normally be able to comprehend the idea of a television, get inspired and hyped up by their party member telling them about the power rangers is kinda great. The earlier episodes of this anime wear that shameless otaku pride on their sleeve, and it works. However, as the show went on I noticed a slow divert back into a generic (or average you might say) isekai adventure that we have all experienced before. That's not to say it wasn't entertaining to watch, I personally was just disappointed that the shameless otaku bits we're too far and few between. In all honesty it's a solid isekai anime, but as an anime in general, it's OK at best. I guess on that note if you're to ask me if you I would recommend it, I probably would tell you to instead watch Endro, THEN come back to Average in the Next Life if you want more of this moe comedy adventure style of isekai.",5
didnt-i-say-to-make-my-abilities-average-in-the-next-life,"At the time of writing this review I'm gonna guess that I have one episode left. That being said, nothing can happen in that last episode that will change my opinion of what this show is.What we have here is an isekai fantasy anime that is trying to be very self-aware. Like my title says, it is a lot like Endro! but unlike Endro!, this show is desperate to be in on the joke with you. The story does a lot of dumb things, and then the characters kind of laugh and mention how dumb it is.Being in on the joke can be done well, but if you're looking for a fantasy isekai where things are ridiculous and it is in on the joke, you should watch KONOSUBA instead.As just a story, this is really just kind of bland. The characters don't really leave an impression. It's a real shame because I know that there is stuff there in the source material. In the end, this one promises a lot of potential that it never delivers on.In the end it just felt like an all female version of Wise Man's Grandchild (which I still think is the ultimate bland anime of the decade) and the cast being all female wasn't really enough to make this any more memorable...or any less bland...",4

didnt-i-say-to-make-my-abilities-average-in-the-next-life,Your not gonna find anything special with this anime. I guess she is overpowered but she literally never shows any of it. I had no problem with a female protagonist but isn't this just weird to anyone else. she doesn't give any vibes that she's crazy OP or anything of the sort. I would love just a bit of fan service where she takes out something in one swoop but no I can't have that ig. It's an ok anime for a Monday morning nothing ground breaking. The side characters are interesting but honestly it feels as though they get more depth than the damn MC like wth is that all about but I digress. Give it a watch if you have time I'm a sucker for isekai so I can't really judge.,5
didnt-i-say-to-make-my-abilities-average-in-the-next-life,"TL;DRWorth a watch, but read the source material after watching it if you can, if you already read it, turn your brain off and don't compare it. Just think of it as a parody of the series. Its average and I want to think that was the point lol.I am one of those that likes the source material, so my opinion may be a bit biased. While I admit I do enjoy it to some extent, its hindering its own potential.First, its a bit to quick to rush into the action, world building is important and especially in this series. The world is very well established in the source material and really draws you in unlike some other isekai. This adaptation only really fills in the blanks needed to understand the current situation, but kind of as an afterthought.Also this is its own series, the plot is barely associated with the source material (that I have seen so far). The main characters are the same, but that is about it. So long story short, you won't get a continuation of the series if you read the source material afterwards.The source material does a better job at making an engaging story, but this makes an entertaining one that will make you laugh here and there. Perfect in my mind if they have no plans for a season 2 to just make it a fun little series that does not take itself seriously. However that does not mean its a great series, likely once its over there won't be much reason to look back or reason to hope for a season 2.",5
didnt-i-say-to-make-my-abilities-average-in-the-next-life,"I guess with average in the title it isn't that hard to expect anything but average from the anime. Mostly, there doesn't seem to be any sort of main focus for this anime. The main character just seems to go along with no real long term goal in mind; other then to try to have an 'average' life which she can enjoy.In a way this is a very 'comedic' approach to 'in another world' anime's that references a lot of other titles from time to time (Fist of the North Star and Dragon Ball to mention a couple); but so far that is about the only thing that makes this anime stand out. Really, with so many of these 'another world' animes coming out, I have to say this is probably something you should skip.",5
didnt-i-say-to-make-my-abilities-average-in-the-next-life,"As may be obvious by now, when reading the other reviews, this anime is based off of a series of light novels. Supposedly.I say ""supposedly"" because it's a rather loose adaptation. Much of the early buildup gets glossed over entirely. We're giving a flying rodent as a narrator and mahou shoujo style sidekick (which supposedly represents the actual system in place; you can read more about that in the light novels). The magic systems in place aren't really expounded upon. All you need to know is that our main character is amazing at it, as expected.So if I had to give my marks on the adaptation aspect, this gets maybe 2 stars at the absolute most...Because it's pretty much a parallel--but ultimate disconnected--story. Too many things changed and too much depth was lost compared to the light novel to really call it a good adaptation. The tone is entirely different, and its aim is entirely different. The pivotal point in this regard is how much Reina's side story will be glossed over in this, and that will come next episode (5).So what does this leave us with? Basically OP cute girls cutely killing things in another world. That's more or less what's left of this.  In its own right, it actually isn't horrible. The production values are alright, the tone is kept fairly consistent, and the girls and their designs are cute. Their personalities also tick most otaku boxes. You have a (modernized) tsundere, tomboy, and kind-and-caring-but-scary-and-has-big-breasts for the companion cast. Fairly wide net. The main character is essentially just beyond a loli and is extremely intelligent but lacks common sense and is clumsy. A somewhat unique mixture that really doesn't make sense, considering how she was in her past life, but at least it's true to the LN.So judged on its own merits, it's okay. But kind of empty. Some arguments have been made that the author went into too much technobabble in their novel to begin with, but I didn't really see that. I read a few volumes myself, and IMO they kept it concise enough... unlike, say, Mahouka. The Mahouka light novels at times had more technobabble than actual development. In fact perhaps this was most of the time. The pacing in this is also too fast, but that's kind of expected. This likely isn't going to run beyond 12 episodes, and there is only so much that can be packed into that.I'm rambling a bit. TL;DR, it's a 2.5-3 star work that's passable in its own right, but as an adaptation it basically throws many of its roots and core content away.",5

Once the first couple of episodes dropped, It started showing me that this show does not follow the original story from the Light Novel nor the Manga of this series. Do yourself a favor and read the books instead, it's much better than this flaming garbageRevision: I originally made this review after watching the first episode because, in all honesty, the first episode is actually terrible. After cringing through the first 30 minutes of this show, it started to grow on me a tiny bit. The character's personalities stayed fairly close to the Light Novel, other than the reoccurring troupes, and I found myself enjoying the characters. I do feel that this is a massive downgrade to the Manga and Light Novel versions, but as a stand-alone, I can see why people like it. It is, by far, not the best thing I've ever seen, the art-style is awful and I really wish they worked on this anime more thoroughly as the animation quality isn't the greatest either. On a good note, however, I did enjoy watching it even though I had read the manga and the first volume of the Light Novel. This show is just ""OK"".",5

didnt-i-say-to-make-my-abilities-average-in-the-next-life,"There's nothing particularly innovative here. Not that it's a bad show by any means because of it. The famous truck hits the protagonist, and they are transported to the fantasy medieval world. The main difference is that our protagonist is a girl and is incredibly self-aware of what's happened (given how she was literally BORN into the new world and has grown up there, albeit retaining memories of her past self.) There's a quality amount of Kawaii and some wall breaking in reference to our world, with humor that works more often than it doesn't (CATCHPHRASES). In a world saturated by shows of this nature, you could do a lot worse, but I doubt INCREDIBLY LONG TITLE will endure beyond the next season or two in memory.

It's got some good meta jokes and shots; the action is pretty satisfying. It's a welcome change to have the main character of an isekai female since there are so many male ones. Also worth noting that the ""animal familiar"" that mile has doesn't have an annoying voice unlike GRANBLUE FANTASY. It didn't really feel cringe but, the MC is nervous almost all the time and shows off her power without thinking at all, contradicting how she wants to be normal. Good show so far, only hope is that it gets a little less humorous and more... purposeful.",4

With that being said, i'm coming at this from a purely anime perspective. Usually, when i see titles like this i tend to brows over them even when i'm caught up with my current anime and need something else to watch. But, I've been getting really desperate so i barely waited tell this title had at least 3 episodes out and decided to watch it (in my opinion three episodes is just the right amount to really get a feel for the show). I can honestly say out of all the second rate anime that I've had to pain through just to wait for a new goodie to come out, that this anime here genuinely caught my attention and doesn't deserve to be roped in with the rest. I laughed, i smiled, and it killed an hour of my time unwinding at the days end before i even knew it was gone. i'll definitely keep watching this anime.",5
didnt-i-say-to-make-my-abilities-average-in-the-next-life,". . . hardcore fans of the original work probably won't like it.This is definitely an adaptation that is meant to get us to a story arc. They didn't spend much time on Mile's backstory and left out a lot, which I thought set up the character relationships really well. I can't speak much to the novel, but I have read the manga and I feel that they could have easily done the manga's version of events and it would have fit into the first three episodes. As it is now, I feel like it somewhat changes the genre to have done the first three episodes as they have. It feels like it is going to be much more parody and slapstick than character driven action comedy.That said, I actually like what they did in the anime and I liked their approach. The first episode needs to go off like a bang and this first episode gets right to the point, i.e. she's super strong, a ditz, wants to be normal, and is going to be in a party. Now I am hoping that the first three episodes are building to a story arc and that it won't continue to be an episodic slap stick fest. Just because I like how they did act one, doesn't mean that that is a sustainable pace. It needs more meat on the bone, but I get why they went the direction they did and I was thoroughly entertained.",5

As someone who was looking forward to one of his favorite manga being adapted, I am going to be very biased in my opinion of this anime.That said, in just two episodes, they have made it very clear that they do not care about the source material at all.  Everything that made the manga stand out was rewritten and replaced with the usual tasteless garbage.  The stakes are gone, characters have been rewritten, dramatic scenes have literally been turned into bad jokes, and it's seriously just on episode 2.  I have no hope for this anime, and it makes me sad to see something so good turned into just another generic cgdct show.",5
didnt-i-say-to-make-my-abilities-average-in-the-next-life,"Short version: if you're coming in from the light novels or manga, lower your expectations, but still give it a shot.So I'm another one coming from the light novels and manga prior to seeing this. I'm still looking forward to watching it unfold, but I was disappointed with the first episode. My best friend and I watched the first episode since I've been recommending the series ever since I stumbled on it. She just kind of tuned out on her phone because she felt it wasn't very engaging, and I can't say she was wrong. The animation itself was pretty, but we didn't really see much beside Mile wandering the city.I'll only really comment on one change: The addition of Nano-chan as a visual representation of the nanomachines was jarring, as well as completely necessary. You kind of need that in visual media. It's why ghosts are often transparent instead of invisible to the viewer, even when the characters can't see them. I like the floating robot design of the manga, but Nano-chan is also cute, and so I can forgive it.As for general commentary... We don't really get a feel for any of their personalities, and the initial plot is similar to something that happens later in the series. Enough so that it feels like it will either rob the later story of any tension by making it feel rehashed, or the anime will cut out a really good character development story for the crew to avoid that feeling. Neither option is terribly appealing.Still, as I noted originally, this is coming from a person who really enjoys the source material. If it were a pilot episode of something I'd never heard of, I might have been more invested in seeing how it played out. Objectively, the story shown isn't what I was looking forward to seeing, so of course I'm disappointed. It's entirely possible that they will take it in a direction that I get just as excited about, or find a way to get it back on the same track the author took in the LN. The manga also cuts ahead to about the same point as the end of the first episode after an intro chapter, so I don't feel this is an unreasonable expectation.",2
didnt-i-say-to-make-my-abilities-average-in-the-next-life,"I loved the books, a nice simple life which feels more like flavor of the week. Its never been a fantastic series looking at it objectively, but I do enjoy it a lot. That said, I do have some gripes with the way this first episode went. It was an entirely anime orginal entry, and while at first I disliked that, over all I feel like as a good introduction it is better for them to start here, then at the actual beginning. Ep 1 does not cover book 1, but instead starts around the time book 2 happens. Which to be quite honest is when the story started to get more focused. Book 1 was a mess of a book with no clear indication of what the author wanted, they even admitted as such in the afterword of the book. That said, the anime adaption is certainly not without the flaws. I feel like some of the injections of exposition, least in EP1, are rather spontanious. The first one made sense placement wise, but the second does not. As well having her reveal how powerful she is in Ep1, it largely goes against her character in those early days where she does everything she can to avoid large displays of power. Since she actively wants to apper normal even when she got angry in the books. So while its comedic, I feel it took away a little of the suspense. Another thing that will bother me till the end of days is their depiction of the Nanomachines. In the books, far as I remember, the nanomachines had no form. It was more so just a voice she talked to. While I understand why they gave the nanomachines a form, the end design honestly looks like they were trying too hard to give her a cute mascot companion when Milie is supposed to be the mascot of the series. Over all, personal Bias would give the books a 8 or 9 out of 10. Anime adaption I give a 7 or 8 out of 10 currently. Objectively though, as I know this series flaws, I would have to say the average person would probably give it a 6 out of 10.",4

The delivery of world building is so terribly organized and explained where your wondering what is happening and then explained like 5 min later, the concept is a decent idea but the delivery on the premise and all is pretty lack luster. The art is alright, but the background, the character design, their personalities, everything is just so mediocre and unappealing. Its a 3* personally at best, but I give it a two because for someone whose usually easily entertained, this felt more like a chore then relaxing to watch. Just dont do it, move on, when you see a CGI scene is already a bad look on anime typically, but when its in the first 30 seconds, you should know better and turn away.",5

It would have been nice to get more story from the manga translated over to the anime but the characters back stories are very well laid out and they all get plenty of character development along the way. As comical as the entire show it, it does a great job sowing in serious undertones. While most of the show focuses on slice of life stuff, the finale leaves the show in a ""playtime is over"" mode. While I wouldn't go as far as to say I was disappointed with the last episode, it felt rushed. It felt like they missed some great opportunities to include more plot from the manga and choreograph a better final battle. Had the finale not felt rushed I definitely would have rated this anime 5 stars. I looked forward every week for this show and I hope it gets a second season!",3.5
didnt-i-say-to-make-my-abilities-average-in-the-next-life,"From the standpoint of this being an anime, the animation is good, the characters are cute, the opening is fun, but the story is only loosely based on the source material. It has a lot of filler for some reason, and for a 12 episode season that seems...bad.From the standpoint of this being an adaptation of a very good light novel, it fails horribly.I've read the light novel, and I've read what there is of the manga, and the anime does a poor job of adapting either of them. For starters, the entire plot of the first episode is made up. It's not in the LN or the Manga. There are filler episodes that don't need to exist when there's perfectly usable content to use instead. Makes no sense.SPOILERS FOLLOW: some of this is covered in the first couple episodes and some of it is stuff that's covered later in the anime very briefly.For starters, the anime begins around chapter 6 of the first volume of the LN. The manga starts around the same place, and fills in the backstory later, so I can sort of forgive that. The skipped chapters include the first arc of the story where Mile is still using her original name, and is at a normal school. Her immense power is found out, she flees the country, and decides to join the Hunter's Guild. Due to a mistake while joining the guild, Mile starts as an F rank, when she should have started at a C or B rank. Guild rules state that you cannot skip ranks once registered, and so Mile would have to spend years on years working her way up the ranks. Instead, they decide to send her to a special prep school for hunters that's supposed to do in six months what would normally take years of work with the guild, and guarantees a D rank upon exiting, with the potential for C rank. That is how Mile gets to where she is at the start of the anime.The little girl at the Inn in episode 1 is a character from the LN, but she's not part of any huge story beats like she is in the anime. She has some screen time in the books (page time?), but she's never involved in any huge stuff. The entire plot of going off looking for her, people kidnapping kids, and meeting her three roommates before going to the hunter school is made up for the anime. In the LN, Mile meets the other three girls for the first time at the prep school when they find they're all in the same room together. The group of ""bad guys"" and their leader is made up. In fact, the light novel doesn't even have any type of real villain in the first volume, it's just Mile and friends at school.Those ""villains"" are also my biggest issue with the first part of the anime. They're completely made up. It's just adding conflict to a story that doesn't need it. Also, the leader is some kind of creepy lolicon pedophile, which is such a weird thing to completely fabricate for a series that doesn't need something like that.Later episodes of the anime seem to have a lot of filler content that wasn't in the novels. I can understand skipping over stuff if you want to spend your time telling other parts of the story, but if you're skipping over actual source material to make up your own stuff, you're no longer adapting a story, you're writing fan fiction. There is absolutely no reason to have filler episodes in a 12 episode series, especially when you skip HUGE parts of the source material to put them in.In my original review, I said that the anime is fine in its own way, but now that it's over I can say that overall, as an anime, it's meh. Even if you ignore the fact it's based off a previous work, the added filler at inappropriate times makes it seem like they weren't really sure what to do next, or how to transition to the next story arc. The filler stuff felt out of place. Knowing that this is based off of something, and that it barely follows it at all, kind of sucks. It makes the filler episodes even more frustrating, because they already have everything they need to tell the story, but instead decide to make something else up, something far less interesting. All I'm saying is, for a trailer that touted how many page views the web novel got, and how many copies the light novels sold, you would think they would at least TRY to follow the story. What makes it worse, is that this season also had an adaptation of a story called ""Ascendance of a Bookworm"". That adaptation is incredibly well done, and it makes me kind of sad that this series didn't get the same treatment.Anyway, as far as story accuracy goes... the names are the same, so they get points for that I guess. It gets a 2/5 because the opening is good, and the animation is nice. It's a really bad adaptation of a really good story, and I highly recommend the light novels to anyone who's interested.",3.5
didnt-i-say-to-make-my-abilities-average-in-the-next-life,"The original story this is based on is.. okay. It's just another Isekai, after all. It has interesting points, but maybe I'm just burned out on the genre.The anime adaption here though is significantly worse than what I'd already consider a B-grade story.The animation itself is not great, and the studio chose to cut out a lot of stuff, add in a lot of new plot and dialogue that wasn't all that well done, and rearrange a bunch of other stuff.At first my thought was that they may have done this to fit more of the story into a 12 episode run, but then after the second episode I realized that, if you ignore the disjointed starting point they chose, it actually makes up more stuff that wasn't originally there than it takes away. Basically the entire first episode was non-canon, and that's a lot of time wasted if their aim is to get through it quickly.Just taken on its own merits, my main issues would be the poor animation, and the strangely disjointed and poorly paced plot (which happens because it is, in fact, disjointed. They took a bunch of stuff from different parts of the story, moved it around and clumsily mashed it together).A lot of stuff is VERY poorly explained in the story as well, if at all.",2

We may have to come up with a different term, such as 'midpoint', to explain how her OP power level is halfway between the level-0 of an NPC and level-max of the dragon, but it's not the average of the power levels. Terms to indicate some mathematically significant terms in a range are:- Mean: sum all values, divide by number of samples- Median: sort all values, then take the one in the middle of the row.- Mode: group all values, select the value that occurs most frequentlyI am addicted to the cuteness of this show, but that one bit of dialog makes my maths makes me want to scream.",3
didnt-i-say-to-make-my-abilities-average-in-the-next-life,"So, as many others have said, this doesn't follow the books at all. It skips over, summarizes, or completely ignores the first book of the series which is very important for building Mile's character and explaining why she decides to become an adventurer. It ignores how these four characters actually meet and become friends (ie. they don't meet before becoming roommates). It's very strange... especially the inclusion of an actual mascot character to represent nano-machines. To sell plushies I guess? I'm not going to give the series 1 or 2 stars for being so divergent from the source material, as I did enjoy the episode, but I also am concerned about what that might mean for the rest of the series. To be clear, I LOVE the light novels (one of my favorite LN series in print now). I just hope this series does them justice.",4

In the light novels, none of the fights and action stuff really took place until book 3, so I'm hoping the reason they skipped this far ahead is to skip the slow start to the series and get into the action and just use flashbacks to slowly fill in miles past. Hopefully, it gets better with the next episodes.",2
didnt-i-say-to-make-my-abilities-average-in-the-next-life,"First episode review:Where do I start? This show is the definition of 'mediocre isekai' nothing (and I truly do mean nothing) stands out about it so far. The main character isn't even given proper introduction in to the world, in fact we don't know how long she's even been there for as it mentions something about ""12 years"" but fails to elaborate any more than that. The plot is best summed up as: the plot holes in this show are so deep they make The Mariana Trench look like a pothole on the sidewalk. I seriously do not believe they could've made the plot more nonsensical than they did, and have explained less than they did. The first episode of an isekai [should] follow the general guideline of explaining basic rules of the new world, explaining in fairly good detail how the character(s) got there, and what their initial reactions to their newfound environment are. Needless to say, this show utterly fails in all three of those areas, and leaves the viewer with more questions than answers, but not in a good way. All in all, 4/10, wouldn't recommend so far. However, I'll update this review at the show's conclusion to give a better more solidified review.",4
didnt-i-say-to-make-my-abilities-average-in-the-next-life,"They start the anime the same way they started the manga which is by skipping the entirety of the first arc, which sets the tone of why she wants to be ""normal"" and why she ran away from her home country and all the relationships that she has built up. Then it adds in this crappy thing about those kidnappers tarnishing what would have been a cool B rank adventure team. they even leave out an important character that mile trains to make herself seem more normal. If you have read the LN i suggest skipping this but if you haven't there might be some redemption somewhere in this show but my bias will most likely forever cloud my vision in seeing it.",3
ascendance-of-a-bookworm,"What makes this story so special for me is the respect that it pays the other world characters.  It's relatively easy to find a story of this type where the reincarnated Japanese brings civilization to a medieval fantasy world.  In those stories, everyone in the world lacks the common sense of an everyday modern citizen and it's really just about the ego trip.  Much of what we know from our lives wouldn't apply in a fantasy world, and it's interesting to see a character be humbled by that.  All the characters are good at what they do, and decades of life experience can't be trumped by someone who's seen a documentary once.  I also enjoy the way that after reincarnating into a child's body, the main character often acts like a child.  She fully assumes her new role, instead of just fulfilling wishes from her previous life.However, the anime is a little lower budget than I was hoping.  If technical quality is important to you, this title is only average.  Its strengths lie elsewhere.  I hope that after watching you are interested in the light novel or manga.",4.5

He hung out with a baby with blonde hair, Zach bell I think it was called. That show was a fever dream. Now this anime is only a little bit of a fever dream and thats why I give Bookworm and the bois 5 star.",5
ascendance-of-a-bookworm,"Alright yes, it is another isekai in the torrent of isekais, the character animation is meh, the voice acting is passable, and the smiles... *shiver*… But what this anime lacks in production value, it more than makes up for in originality. While I said it was an isekai, it is far from your typical power fantasy isekai that you can find just about anywhere, instead going for slice of life anime with a character who is the opposite of overpowered. Instead of the grand adventure to do good, it's all about making books and enjoying life with friends. Plus, while the character animation is on the poorer side, the background art is really good and emulates a lived in medieval town decently well. If you're done with isekai by now, don't worry, this is not THAT kind of isekai.",5
ascendance-of-a-bookworm,"I will come back and edit this and re-rate it as the series continues but, so far, it's very promising.Myne is an interesting character, the premise of a world without books except for the rich  is completely believable, and the people in it are much more than just one-dimensional -- so not the usual isekai series.The animation is lovely, the world building is well done and quite detailed and the OP is still stuck in my head.Overall, I enjoyed the first episode and am dying to see where it goes next.",5
ascendance-of-a-bookworm,"I was so disappointed to see yet another isekai anime, but 3 ep in, so far so good. It doesn't look like your typical isekai anime.

As a huge book lover this has my heart so far and I completely understand her passion. I'm excited for this anime every week. The story is engaging, wholesome, and I care about the main character.",5
ascendance-of-a-bookworm,"So what kind of isekai is this? Most would say it's nothing like a normal isekai, but I say that both is and isn't true at the same time. The protagonist is in the abnormal role of being an isekai character reincarnated into a fantasy world and living a relatively normal life in a normal household in a mostly normal medieval city. The protagonist is OP, but she doesn't have access to her OPness yet nor is she or anyone else even aware of it other than the viewers. This means that while the character isn't going on any world saving quests (and probably won't throughout the series), the story is open-ended enough to leave the possibility that that might happen someday up in the air. After all, the protagonist knows little about the world beyond her hometown, so the world could be in terrible danger, yet we, the viewers, would be blissfully unaware.Think of it this way: most of the time in reincarnation isekai, a character dies in our world and is reborn in another either with the same age and form they had here or into a completely new body that they have to grow up with. This is the latter case, but with any other isekai like this, the story always begins many years after the fact, and information of what happened when they first arrived and acclimated is told briefly in flashbacks and hindsight (like, for example, what happens in Didn't I Say to Make My Abilities Average in the Next Life). This one doesn't do that. Ascendance of a Bookworm takes us through the long process of the reincarnated isekai hero learning how to live in a new environment, showing us the intricacies of mundane life while slowly building up the protagonist's relationships, repertoire and dropping hints at future OPness (rather than just give them a video game menu and knowledge on how to use it right from the beginning) throughout the course of her early life.To put it simply, then, this is not the story of an OP protagonist on a quest to save the world. It's the prequel story: the story of the early life of an OP protagonist who will maybe, at some point in the distant future, be forced to embark on a quest to save the world, but not today. And honestly, I think that's genius, because the author took the segment of the Isekai protagonist's life that always gets skipped over and made an entire series about it.",5
ascendance-of-a-bookworm,"I loved the manga of this anime its wholesome and relaxing but at the same time sad as well could it be emotions??, anyways this is a fun anime unlike other isekai where the main character just does everyting  he/she wants and blablah u know the story.This anime take a different direction myne who has some what an illnes and is trying to cope with her short and frail body is somehting new and the athmosphere of her family is great and everything its just nice,relaxing its different but at the same time still at heart isekai.Just like that time I got reincarnated as a slime.If it has better animation in the future then I hope it does well its great show imo.",5
ascendance-of-a-bookworm,"At first I was bored and uninterested but every episode is filled with building blocks to support the next. If you accept the fact that it has ""Slice of life"" genre you will definitely start to watch it with interest. I have always enjoyed romance and action and some with mix of both genre. However, Slice of life with touch of Isekai is new to me therefore I didn't accept it until the 3rd time I attempted to watch the episode 1 without skipping through boring scenes.     None of it is boring in fact, I was just nit picking the parts that would've piqued my interest. But when I saw it all without skipping, I was hooked in. Episode after episode is spent and I am satisfied. In fact, I wanted more! I truly hope that they create more seasons to come for this series.The characters are in fact quite likable, lovable, interesting and amazing. Each character has a purpose and connection (as they should be) and there are forms of development in which very critical to the story. The only downside is the fact that kindness and good things overshadow the dark side of the Isekai world she got brought in. Nobility are cruel, selfish and greedy individuals, especially towards those who are lower in rank than themselves. There are some depiction however not fully developed or we might see more of it in the next episodes to come. Human in general are cruel, selfish, greedy, etc... But if you have stature and power, you'd want to keep it for yourself or for your love ones.      Ofc who wouldn't want to keep beneficial things for ourselves? It is kind of instinctive. But Main is different. She understand that there has to be a balance between that. She want to keep things for herself and her family but has to conform with the current world she live in, therefore negotiation is an option and if all things fail ""Chikara/Power"" is a must because there can only be negotiation if both party are considered equal or the disadvantaged is willing to accepting the terms/condition. There are more obstacles to come and that's exactly why this show is interesting. I truly loved this series. I want more, seriously!",5
ascendance-of-a-bookworm,"Seriously if they made an isekai anime about my book nerd ass, it would be this. Main is so intensely relatable in her absolute unfailing obsession to read books, I feel her pain in every single episode. It's refreshing and inspiring in its depiction of her determination and adaptability, and really gives a feel like if you really really love something like Main loves books, you'll somehow find a way to acquire it.",5
ascendance-of-a-bookworm,"Waited for the season to finish before writing a review. With no (overdone) overpowered Isekai protag, no game-based system, and very little magic until the second half of the season, Ascendance of a Bookworm is simply about what the title says - a reincarnated bookworm living in a medieval world trying do what she wants most: read books. But circumstance and the world she's in hinder her dream, but she doesn't give up! The best part of the show in my opinion comes from how Myne (the MC) goes through trial and error to try and make her books. She has the knowledge, but that doesn't always translate to ability or resources needed to make paper. Along the way, she makes new things that better the lives of her new family and others around her - and it's not until later that others convince her to make a profit off of those things. She agrees, but only because it'll help her endgoal of making/reading books. It's adorable how single minded she is about it, completely derailing her thoughts sometimes at the mention of books and being able to read them. All the characters have their own personalities and are well rounded, none having the over-exaggerated characteristics/tropes of other anime - but they have their quirks that come through. The show shines best in its simplicity to just tell Myne's story, along with the people she interacts with. I actually feel the show loses a little something when magic is properly introduced and it somewhat devours the story, but it doesn't become the main focus which is good, and the show does a great job. I highly recommend this for anyone who wants a simple story away from the flashy fights and other anime-ness of other shows to go to a simpler, more earnest story.",5
ascendance-of-a-bookworm,"TL,DR: A distilled gem of wholesome goodness, that will have you involuntarily grinning like an idiot whether you want to or not. Truly excellent writing, fantastic characters, and unparalleled world building make this a must watch series! When watching anime, I tend to gravitate towards action-heavy shows with a heavy dose of guns, swords, and violence, or series that feature dark stories with heavy atmospheres. intriguing premises, and morally grey heroes. I've really enjoyed stuff like Jormungand, Attack on Titan, Tanya the Evil, Black Butler, etc. Ya know, stuff that ain't exactly ""family friendly."" So when I saw Ascendance of a Bookworm pop up on my radar, I almost wrote it off as not my cup of tea. I mean, c'mon. A little girl trying to make books? Boooorrrrriiiiinnnggggg... right?WRONG! This show is one of the best anime I've seen in a long time, ranking among my all time favorite shows! I'll be watching it alone in my room, and realize that I am sitting there smiling from ear to ear like a madman! Its just so wholesome and sweet! No fan service, no violence, no fights. Just pure, unadulterated happiness. It is a masterpiece of world building, storytelling, and exceptionally good writing.Main and her friends and family are just amazing! Each character feels like a real person, with flaws, strengths, and emotions. The writing is such that the meandering pace of the series doesn't hamper it in the slightest. If anything, it enhances the story, giving viewers time to really immerse themselves in the world. You can really understand the situations and can feel the weight behind events that occur, even if there aren't earth shattering consequences lurking behind every decision. And the writers don't shy away from addressing interesting metaphysical topics. Ya know questions that come along with someone suddenly existing in a different time and place in a completely different body, as it relates to both them and those surrounding them.You can tell that the author really put time and thought into this work of art. It just feels like a gentle labor of love, like the author is truly crafting this beautiful story because they genuinely love it. And when someone puts forth this amount of effort, it would be a crying shame to not partake of it. I ABSOLUTELY recommend this anime!",5
ascendance-of-a-bookworm,"I've been reading the official J-Novel Club translation of the English light novels (which is currently on volume 5), and I have to say this anime is very well done. The animation is simple, and at times stiff, but you can tell just by watching that this is a passion project worth supporting. As of episode 8, the anime is halfway through volume 2, and it hopefully will get to the end of volume 3 after all 14 episodes are out.And even if you don't read novels, this is a great, wholesome, and riveting story that anyone will enjoy. It's nothing like any isekai you've ever watched, and anyone who thinks this is ""just another isekai"" is really missing out on something quite special.Please try it!",4.5
ascendance-of-a-bookworm,"I read the English Light Novel version of this (Localized from the original Japanese Web Novel) before realizing this even had an anime and I must say that this adaptation loses a lot of the magic.  The pacing is weird, a lot of the effort the author put into world building and character development is lost, and in just the first 5 episodes I've already seen two things that are big reveals in the LN just kind of...thrown in there.  It doesn't help either that the production values are a bit on the shoddy side.My Suggestion: Start with the Novel so you can experience the story as intended, then you can watch this if you enjoy works of art being destroyed.",4.5
ascendance-of-a-bookworm,"As a person who gives a lot of anime the 3 episode trial and move on, I was absolutely caught off guard when this beautiful story stole my heart on the first episode. I love the story, the characters. They do an amazing job with the characters' backstories. I love that they didn't make the main character so overpowered, and has true issues to overcome. The entire crew is a genius. Thanks for this beautiful story.",5
ascendance-of-a-bookworm,"this is a series that i dind't thougt much of when i saw the poster and read the premise so i didn't watch it for a while but one day i was bored and desided to watch the first episode and was hooked from the beging, this series has a certain alure to it. a way to make you wonder about this world, a nice feeling as you see the characters interacts. althoug the plot moves slowly it just keeps gatting better and better to the point where this is the anime i'm looking foward the most every weak.",5
ascendance-of-a-bookworm,"Initial Thoughts: Ascendence of a Bookworm was a show that I initially didn't even consider to be a show I would watch.  Thankfully as I was going to the depression of how horrible this season was and how there weren't any shows out there which weren't either extremely generic or had a d-bag of an MC to deal with.On the day I looked up Ascendance I thought I was just going to be wasting my time with another bad anime like all the others, the first two episodes were pretty slow in my eyes but they did a good job building the show, looking back I believe the writer and production staff did right by this speed as the show seemed to build it's pace at an equivalent rate as it went on.   Maine:   At first I thought I was going to be annoyed because the main character Maine is a bookworm, but I was completely wrong, it was really cool how she was bringing all these inventions like paper made from plants, shampoo ect into the world.  I also really enjoyed the intellect of the show as the conversations were often very intricate showing the skills that Maine brought from our world over there.World:  I love Isekai worlds, its really the best part of these types of shows, but the ""generic MC goes to Isekai"" actually doesnt exist in this world, and Maine is anything but generic, instead of showing up a level 1000 in this Isekai world Maine ends up in a body that can hardly walk, she gets tired extremely easy so needs people to carry her around, so in this show it feels more like Maine is part of the world where other Isekai's the MC is suppose to be some hero and none of the characters have any depth at all.After thoughts:  Even if you dislike Isekai this show is one that you should watch, it doesn't follow most of the Isekai tropes and sticks with a more personal level in respects to Maine and interactions with the people around her, you get to see how this worlds economy and family setup works and it's really fun, this show is a solid 9/10 for me and i'm so glad the best show for this season is going to get a second season.",5
ascendance-of-a-bookworm,"Most Isekai are usually combat related and all too often revolve around some power trip,  mind you those are not bad in their own right.  Rising of the shield hero was nice,  and I AM someone who liked SAO(I know a guilty pleasure by some opinions),  furthermore I am looking forward to ""I'm a spider,  so what?"".This anime,  is not like those however.  Furthermore the Isekai part of it is VERY IMPORTANT for the plot rather then just some ""detail"".  It has a lot of fluff and slice of life elements to the start of it,  so for some it might take awhile to get started(for some,  I liked it from the VERY beginning).  Its kind of ""Doctor Stone"" in its beginning except more slice of life like.  However that said,  this is a VERY different style of anime once it gets going.Mercantilism,  Politics,  the aforementioned creation of items(doctor stone as stated),  and family matters/drama all come into big play around the middle and only get more intense as it goes on.  Many in the comments section would mention tears and sadness at elements therein.This is without a doubt for me,  my anime of the year.  I rarely do reviews unless I am bored,  love something to death,  or see a sad lack of attention to a masterpiece.  This is the second and the third.  I love this show and its being moderately ignored.  Its one of the best animes I've seen in awhile.Perhaps you might love it too,  give it try.  Especially if your a fan of shows like Spice and Wolf,  Doctor Stone,  or even games like Recettear(CAPITALISM HO!)",5
ascendance-of-a-bookworm,"To me, writing is the key element to any series. Relying on gratuitous action, fanservice, and slapstick comedy to carry a series makes or breaks a series for me.As an example, some of the old Doctor Who classic episodes were written so well that my immersion wasn't broken by the god awful low budget special effects from the 60s-80s.This anime has no:   -Thrilling action.   -Fan service.   -Overly dramatic romance.And it's better off without it.",5
ascendance-of-a-bookworm,"Urano Motosu died how she lived, loving books. Upon waking up in another world as a young child, naturally her first response was to find a book as soon as possible. Sadly, in this new world she lives in, there is not a single book to be found. She now lives the daily life of a sickly girl named Myne, with a family she never knew prior, in what seems to be a time period similar to the middle ages. Eventually she learns that books do indeed exist, but only the nobility can acquire such a precious luxury. Despite her inconvenient circumstances and sickly body, Myne now is hellbent on using all her knowledge from her past life, as well as the resources at her to create books herself!Ascendance of a Bookworm is the ultimate dark horse anime to come out of 2019. I myself stopped watching the show only halfway into its first episode, only to come back a few weeks later when recommended to by a close friend. I sincerely urge you the reader to not make the same mistake I did, don't let this anime pass your attention!It's a rather simple slice of life anime at its core, needless to say with what information on it I've already synopsis-ed, it is very slow. However, I think that's the key to this anime's success! It's pacing and methodical story will immediately be a treat to fans of cult classics of the likes of legendary anime like Spice and Wolf. There is a lot of care and attention into every detail surrounding Myne's routines and struggles, even if it's at the expense of the stories pacing. While that may lose the attention of some viewers, it makes that final moment where Myne completes one of her goals oh so satisfying! Along with helping Myne with her objectives is a collection of incredible cast members. I absolutely adore Myne's family, if it wasn't for Myne's endearing goals, this anime could have been a heartwarming slice of life on it's own. Other than family members, she's also got her neighbor Lutz also who's her age. Lutz is an earnest lad that is reliable every step of the way. I myself felt very comfortable and safe whenever he was on screen, knowing deep down Lutz would be able to safeguard/assist Myne from any obstacle in her way. There's also a plethora of other side characters that are just the cherry on top of an already excellent cast! Eventually Myne's over fixation on books starts to decline, as she realizes just how valuable the people she has around her are. Not entirely though, because by the end of the day, Myne still dreams of the day she can read a book again.Ascendance of a Bookworm is one of the best anime of the year, it came completely out of nowhere this year! Especially during a season that had numerous isekai anime that were actually good! Not only did it surprise and rise in popularity through critical acclaim, it managed to overtake most if not all it's competition! Yet it doesn't stop there, for a second season is already in the making, set to release in April 2020!Might I just say, with the return of Re:ZERO for season 2, SNAFU's long awaited season 3, and my personal favorite anime Princess Principal's movie series premier, April was already shaping up to be a great anime season! Now with Ascendance of a Bookworm slatted to return in April too, what else could an anime fan such as myself ask for?",5
ascendance-of-a-bookworm,"Honestly the plot is really good, it is quite long before it starts, but each episodes have its own unique charm. There's not much action (except in the last 2 episodes of the season 1) but this is what makes it charming. I don't really know how to describe the way I feel when I watch this show, it lighten my heart. In other words, I love this show.This review probably didn't help you to know if its a good show or not, but I really recommend it. Like, seriously, watch a few episodes and you'll probably get charmed by the characters and the plot.",5
ascendance-of-a-bookworm,"I know a lot of people aren't really into the slice of life genre (myself included). However, this series is a true gem. I binged the entire thing after watching through the first episode and there is still so much more content left in the light novel. I really can't praise this series enough, the animators have done an amazing job (along with the artists), and the story still feels whole despite the limited time-span animators are given to convey an entire story. 5 * this is one you do not wanna skip over",5
ascendance-of-a-bookworm,"What this anime brings is a wonderful story in a fantasy world, not from the view of the powerful but the every day person. I love how the protagonists humble beginnings are not glossed over but put on display to show the struggle that it takes to raise one self up and not made a joke, like in so many fantasy slice of life anime. While this anime may be slow it makes up for it by being well thought out and just a wonderful thought provoking story. This one is a Keeper!",3
ascendance-of-a-bookworm,"Highly enjoyable, exciting and cute show! Love love love this! Hope they continue making these! This story line is satisfying in the sense that if you were in the same position you would absolutely exploit the knowledge you have! How many times do people say “I wish I knew that when I was younger” well she did and what she does with that knowledge is awesome! Really looking forward to this story developing",5
ascendance-of-a-bookworm,"I haven't really watched a lot of anime recently. The last few seasons of the few I picked out, I don't think I watched any of them to completion. This one however, really gripped me. There are going to be a ton of people sticking there nose up at this one cause of its genre, but don't let them talk you out of trying it. I'm not going to argue that this is a masterpiece. I'm not going to say it's the best thing to watch this season for most people. What I will say is that for me, for the first time in quite a while, I was having a great time watching an anime.",4.5
ascendance-of-a-bookworm,This season of anime is probably my most contentious seasons. Simply because we have bookworm and average. Bookworm is a very very faithful adaption and average a very cartoonish adaption. I cannot hate average it is filled with nostalgia but makes me long for a more adept adaption thanks to bookworm. This adaption of  bookworm is almost spot on perfect. This is with out a doubt the star of this season of anime!,4.5
ascendance-of-a-bookworm,I am in love with this anime.  Unique. Interesting. They took a concept that most might find boring and brought it to life!  The music is beautiful and haunting.  I can't stop listening to it!  The coup de grace is at  the very end of every show there is a still frame art render that is just gorgeous every time.  I highly recommend this to anyone interested in high quality slice of life fantasy.  This is not a shonen fight manga so don't watch it with that expectation.,5
ascendance-of-a-bookworm,"Ascendance of a Bookworm is so far amazing! Granted, I will admit that this anime is very niche in the sense it is for people who love books and do not need action/ adventure to drive the plot. Creates a whole detailed world in the matter of episodes, and implements history, economics, science, botany, and class system very well. The POV is from a college student who loves reading and is transported into a child's body. Her inner monologue and extreme amount of tenaciousness drives the story beautifully. Plus it has magic, life struggle, comedy, and a dash of romance (non sexual, they are children) to balance out the heartwarming episodes.",5
ascendance-of-a-bookworm,"Great show. Simple, compelling and you cant help but love all the characters. Its a fun and different take on the issekai genre. Highly recommend. In fact, im not sure i remember any issekai anime with a female protagonist. One thing i love is how the main character really is leveraging her knowledge of a more advanced society here. Its a concept that doesnt get applied in many issekai anime, not to this degree anyway.",5
ascendance-of-a-bookworm,"I'm enjoying this show.  I hope that it stays safe to watch with my kids as they enjoy it too.  While there is an audience for ecchi, gore, action and horror type series out there, a tamer, wholesome series has an audience as well.  The premise is interesting as well, with a slight DR. Stone vibe in that she's trying to build technology (although all book related) unknown to this world from scratch.",5
ascendance-of-a-bookworm,This Isekai follows a girl reborn into a new body from a different world but retains her knowledge.  A slice of life isekai that steadily progresses the story rather than jumping through parts like there's a marathon to be won if you get to the ending after 20 years in 12 episodes.  Each episode introduces new ideas and with them new troubles which the young girl must hurdle through if she is to acquire her dream of reading books in a time where paper is highly expensive.,5
ascendance-of-a-bookworm,"If we're comparing this to other animes in general, this is one of the most original animes in 2019. The story starts off with a 21-year old college girl being reincarnated into a 5-year old girl named Main (Myne, Mine, that's how the anime spells it don't ask me). Now that we have identified it's an isekai, let's what our MC's Status is: a frail, weak girl who was born into a poor soldier's family with a sister. That generally does not seem like the most impressive conditions to an isekai regarding that most of these isekai genre anime's MCs are male characters who are incredibly powerful and has a harem of ""cute"" girls. She goes on trying to satisfy her insatiable desire for her books using several different methods that existed in Earth. What makes this anime really different though are two things: The fact that the MC, who was previously 21, turned into a 5-year-old, and the great writing on the characters! Ok where do we start... Ah! Yes! An isekai where a character turns into an incredibly young child! That's the most original thing I saw in years! No violence! No romance! Only a child with a fully developed brain who is working hard to get books but everyone is treating her like a child because she technically is a child! It is so satisfying to watch because it is unpredictable Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hide(But somewhat is because alot of us don't do business deals with a 5 year old). Then the characters... The characters are very unexpected written well. Even though only 2 characters are truly dynamic, every single character so far is alive. The father, a person who really wants his daughter's attention and love. The mother, a person who wants the best for her sister and the MC. The sister, a growing and caring child who recently started working as an apprentice in looming. And Etcetera. The characters aren't written like masterpieces and details because the point of the story is around Main getting her precious books, but it is written well enough to the point where you remember.In a nutshell:  The author wrote a hard situation to work out of. However, she did it either way! This story is incredibly underrated and you should watch it! It does start semi-slow and confusing, but once you reach episode 3, you will get hooked! Keep in mind, I only write reviews  for the shows I think deserve it.",5
ascendance-of-a-bookworm,"I read ahead and I still want to watch the anime. It is a great story and a beautiful show. I didn’t even realize I’ve been watching for the whole show until it ended and I wanted more. Five stars would watch multiple times until satisfied. Even new episodes give me excitement that I haven’t felt in a while, and it is great they returned to the female protagonist for isekai anime. It has been awhile. I love this show.",5
ascendance-of-a-bookworm,"I have read some poorer reviews and noticed it's all about the time you put in. In the first episode as soon as it starts, we see that our protagonist Main is a young adult woman that starts and tells her story. The genre itself is not very much about the suspense or complicated story line, after all this is a kid show with a truly wholesome feeling to it. It makes you feels warm and fuzzy inside because of how Main is a nice little girl. Quickly, as some people have denounced, it's clear this frail 5 yo kid is a proper ""genius"" but there's a secret that she's afraid to share with everybody for obvious reasons;She's in a patriarchal medieval fantasy world, and anybody with a once of sense knows that if she was to stand out too much, it could mean trouble.She's careful but quickly she stands out and this is where the story starts to get fun.She learns about this New World she has reincarnate in and starts her new life. The ""kid show"" portion is very much evident has this show tries to teach young girls to be independent, to become strong in difficult time, to love your friends and family, to follow your passions. It's pretty cute and will make your day little less dark!",5
ascendance-of-a-bookworm,"I must say, it is good to see something different from genre that many thought was too crowded and too overdone. Given that most Anime started from books ((Manga and Lite novels) it makes sense that viewers would be attracted to the premise of an overwhelming desire to read. Add to that the well crafted characters and story arc that does rely on defeating some demon lord or evil this or that. Just a human striving to learn and improve life one painful step at a time. Well done to the writers.",5
ascendance-of-a-bookworm,"I came into this thinking it was going to be some magical isekai anime that books are powerful and knowledge gives you power or something along those lines.  I am finding myself grinning ear to ear with what i got.  the protag, aptly named Main, Is just a super smart women from modern day japan that was reborn into this little girl.  Her knowledge from reading any and every book known to man is what makes her special.  I'm bad at writing reviews.  but what i can tell you is that this is just so fun to watch and i cant wait to see each episode.  If you cant decide if you want to watch it, stop reading this and go watch it NOW!",5
ascendance-of-a-bookworm,"The first few episodes are so heartwarming and cute, also the entire concept of the anime is lovely! I cant tell whats going to happen next and I can't wait to find out! From the intro we know that this is a magical world, but there's so much happening in the series right now the creators almost make us forget about it until they bring up the strange ice tree in ep. 3. I'm very interested to see what kind of a role magic plays in this world.",4.5
ascendance-of-a-bookworm,"It's an awesome feel good series. All of the characters thus far are likable if not lovable, the art is great, the voice acting is perfect, and the relationships are adorable. The main character, Main, is super knowledgeable, due to her tensei-isekai-ness, but she isn't OP. If anything, she's the opposite as she is born the frail daughter of a peasant family. Everything she does is because of her knowledge. I also like that, unlike a lot of isekai protagonists, she has real empathy. When she outdoes her big sister, she honestly feels bad, but she also doesn't have the answer to the problem and has to rely on her mom. All the while, her singular interest is to be able to make books because she was formerly a librarian.I feel like in a lot of ways, this is what the isekai genre was missing, at least in anime. Every isekai anime up til this point, it feels like, is fantasy-action. This is a pleasant departure from that. It is a character driven, relaxed pace, feel good story. It's special in how much it isn't special yet is so charming. I would go so far as to say that this is like Ikoku Meiro no Croisée, but instead of the MC being from a different country, she's from a different world. This is on pace to be one of my favorite animes of the year.",4.5
ascendance-of-a-bookworm,So Iseki is about fighting and so hey book did you know this was about books well it's about books and a small sickly girl but books man did I forget to mention books I think I forgot to mention its got books... Honestly its wholesome anime about a girl who wants her goddam books. She's a sickly weak little girl Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideWHO CANT FLIP A DAM PANCAKE!!!!! And I'm in love with it this is going to be a very good anime and I want more.,5
ascendance-of-a-bookworm,If you like isekei's you will like this. It comes at it from a unique perspective that is refreshing. Now for my warped synopsis:Its about a librarian who dies and reincarnates in another world by possessing the body of a dying fever stricken 5 year old in a medieval slum. She charms her impoverished acquaintances with knowledge and crafting skills from the old world. This eventually catches the eye of a leader of the local religious order. This leader then secludes her in his room where he then ruphees her in order to perform magical rituals upon her without consent.,5
ascendance-of-a-bookworm,"One is pretentious title, pretentious fetish of main character (books) and those irritating micro scenes that demonstrate internal monologue of MC, they try to be funny and cute and are neither of those.Apart from that, this is very nice show, that i could recommend (after 3 episodes) to anyone that is still tired after disappointment that was Isekai Sht Magician.Nice world building, interesting plot and its development, calm and warm setup.",5

It lacks action but makes up for it with good attention to details, believable world building and a tiny, likable MC. This show fills a particular niche and is great at what it does.",5
ascendance-of-a-bookworm,"So far the first episode is pretty boring, but I wonder if this is an anime that starts slow and builds up, who knows, so far  I really love the art style and animation, its not generic isekai trash animation that we see in other isekai, the animation is smooth and clean, this anime has a lot of promise for possible world building scenarios in future episodes, and its kinda odd, giving the protagonist is a bookworm, but has not even brought up the idea they were reincarnated, nor not realize what era they're in, which is weird considering the're a book worm, this seems like its gonna be a kid friendly anime, but that's fine, though the first episode was pretty boring, but it is the first episode so I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt until newer episodes come out, the music is also pretty  relaxing and nice.",5
ascendance-of-a-bookworm,"I find the lack of yelling, screaming, announcing attacks, forced confrontations with antagonist to be refreshing.  The MC faces more pedestrian foes in day to day challenges which, through her own will and perseverance , she overcomes.  Her challenges are relatable to the average viewer.  I find myself rooting for the MC and her small triumphs as she progresses through this tale. I think many will enjoy this series.",5
ascendance-of-a-bookworm,to keep it short and simplenot much of a plot until you reach the end where it really starts taking off. Not your average isiki ( its only an isiki because of a simple plot spec rather than enveloping around it). heart warming and hits hard on the issues a lot about wanting to die or maintain the will to live (didn't expect that). Overall not the best of best but better a lot better than the average,5
ascendance-of-a-bookworm,"I have thoroughly enjoyed the manga adaptation of this story & was super excited when i heard they would be releasing a anime version. fast forward to today when i tried to watch the first episode & i couldn't look past everyone's HORRIFYING DEAD CGI EYES. to quote Robert Shaw from Jaws: ""lifeless eyes, black eyes, like a doll's eyes"". i kept thinking to myself ""i'll just get over it sooner or later"" but after 20 minutes where every time a character's eyes were shown on screen it was all i could focus on i decided to stop.tl;dr if you can get over the way the eyes are animated, you'll probably like this because (if they stick to the plot) the story and characters are all interesting and realistically portrayed.",5
ascendance-of-a-bookworm,"It starts out with an adult mind raping a child. Not really a great story if that's how you want to begin it. The manga was tolerable but with this part, I cannot suggest anyone taking in this story. The MC is constantly ""sick"" and rather than letting her family in on her story to help her, she goes to outside help and gets taken advantage of constantly. A very, very poorly designed and executed story.",5
ascendance-of-a-bookworm,"...but I can't. This show poorly explores the very tired ""reborn in a fantasy world"" genre. The ending is basically spoiled in the first minute of the show so there is nothing really keeping you watching aside from how she gets there. One episode in they give you an extremely one dimensional, tropey character that utterly and completely relies on plot devices and everyone around her being completely oblivious to the fact that she is obviously an adult woman in a 5 year old's body, which brings us to why I feel it earned 1 star......The second episode is a whole lot more of the same, nothing to see here, except them sexualizing 5 year olds like it was some high school drama. Like, holy shit. This is creepy even by anime standards. They literally gave a 5 year old a deep, sultry voice and a broody attitude and then immediately began building a romance around him that the (old woman in a freaking child's body) is totally falling for. Got Dayum!So to sum it up, wanted to give it 2 stars, giving it 1 because of jaw-droppingly inappropriate innuendos.",4.5
the-rising-of-the-shield-hero,"Damn what a show...I thought I was finally done with the isekai genre, then in 2018 That Time I Got Reincarnated as a slime came out. and man did it blow me away. It gave me hope, and then just to add the cherry on top, this show came out. and damn did it shock me. When I first saw it I thought, meh. But I thought I would give it a try, and I'm glad I did!Not to spoil anything but when I was watching it, it became quite a tear jerker.Do not overlook this anime. You'd be missing out",4.5
the-rising-of-the-shield-hero,"In the beginning it started a bit slow but it picked up real fast. The character development has been incredible so far and the premise is interesting and unique. Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideI love how he is taking on the role of the bad guy (outwardly) and hedging his bets on going it alone. This show looks extremely promising. This is the first review I've ever written on an anime simply because this is one of the first to leave a real impact on the first episode. I also love the fact the episode is as long as it is. Really gives you time to sink into the anime and get more involved with the plot as it goes along. Very well done, looking forward to the future of this anime!",5
the-rising-of-the-shield-hero,"Ok, let’s be honest who tf reads reviews?! Get in there and watch the damn show! This is definitely one of the good ones out there! Although, since this is technically a “review” I might as well state some of the obvious.1. Great animation2. Good music3. Interesting plot4. Feels5. A fkn b*tch! (AKA someone to hate during “plot”)There you have it! All the reason I gave it 5 stars are right above. Now go watch it!",5
the-rising-of-the-shield-hero,"The Rising of the Shield Hero being released at the same time as That Time I Was Reincarnated As a Slime is amazing in that we have the two of the best isekai animes in the last few years hitting us all at once. To those who enjoy that satisfying sense of progression seen in RPG games (New Skills, Leveling up, etc) in a serious, well written form I promise you will love The Rising of the Sword Hero. The MC is not some generic, cookie cut protag like most shows trying to capitalize on the rise in popularity of isekai shows. I can understand what he does, why he does it, and what he feels from the way his character was developed in the same way as many hit shonen shows such as HxH in that the character is introduced early and simply and it just fits together so well ill stop rambling just try it out man.",5
the-rising-of-the-shield-hero,"I don't have a lot of time, so I'm not going to go too in depth into this.When I first heard about this, I wasn't really looking forward to it.  I've seen a lot of isekai anime, and they just start to get old after a while.  However, once I looked into the anime a bit, I learned that two of my favorite voice actors would be working together: Asami Seto and Kaito Ishikawa.  Fans of ""Bunny Girl Senpai"" from last season will know them as Sakurajima Mai and Azusagawa Sakuta respectively.  That alone was enough for me to give this anime a fair shot.When I started watching the first episode, I wasn't expecting to enjoy it.  And for the first half hour or so (it's an hour long special), I wasn't very impressed.  It was predictable and uninteresting.  I was expecting that I would drop it, but the last 15 minutes or so of the episode completely changed my mind.The second episode is packed with character development, but it's not boring exposition and drivel like many other isekai.   We're introduced to the characters in a way that makes us invested in them.  It makes us curious about what will happen to them in the future.  It makes us keep watching.Trust me, this isn't just following the tried and true template of other isekai anime.  Although the first episode does little to justify that claim.  But if you can make it beyond that, I think this could be a very interesting and well made anime.  I'm looking forward to more.NOTE:  This was written after watching just 2 episodes.  My opinion is subject to change as the show progresses.",5
the-rising-of-the-shield-hero,"Personally a top 10 action slight romance. His faces when even the mention of the word royalty is my face 24/7 it’s great. It’s an overall great hype building anime the intense battle scenes get me tense as well as the hurry the heck up a kith scenes are also great lol. Love how so far they hint romance but they are engaging the plot tremendously and I have 0 problems with it. They do it in such a great job you don’t even notice until you’re done binge watching and asking yourself why did I finish this so fast lol. Overall great anime, great protagonist, great plot, great action, great supportive characters, great antagonist that make you cringe when they appear. 10/10",5
the-rising-of-the-shield-hero,"Well, the way this started out, I imagined it would be yet another ""players stuck in video game"" re-hash. After just two episodes, I knew it was something far better. A hero that everyone hates, frames, blames, and fears is a much better story than the rest of these types of anime. It gets surprisingly dark for a shounen. Though, maybe it's more of a seinen. I dunno, I'm not an anime expert. So far, there have only been a couple of episodes that we didn't need, or that didn't show us anything new. Overall, though, I'm really digging the story, the ""game"" mechanics, and how the story follows its logic consistently. Different mechanics for each hero, ""real-world"" repercussions for everything the heroes do, the fact that different kingdoms perceive the Shield Hero differently from the main one (I forget its name). The characters in it feel more or less like real people. They all have their own stories, perspectives, and motivations. The only major gripe I have (aside from absolutely despising the character of Melty, which is the point of her existence, I suppose) is that Naofumi is the only hero we know anything about. Even then, the only things we know about Naofumi are his thoughts and personality. Basically, the other three Cardinal Heroes are just foils and don't have any defining characteristics, motivations, etc. The only thing we know about them is that the Sword Hero is kind of a jerk, the Spear Hero is a naïve fool, and the Bow Hero is more skeptical and logical than the other two. That's it. That's everything we know about them. I wish they were more fleshed-out. Of course, there are only about 20 episodes out right now, which isn't enough to make every single character feel real and fleshed-out, but I'm hoping they get to it sooner rather than later. In all, it's definitely worth checking out. Not as boring or unoriginal as you would think, despite the pretty cliché premise. The action is good. The animation is above average. I dig the art style. The story is arguably the most interesting one I've seen in months, aside from Kimetsu no Yaiba (Demon Slayer). You most likely won't be disappointed.",5
the-rising-of-the-shield-hero,"I feel so emotionally manipulated. Shield started off as an anti-hero story with a edgy, disillusioned main character. That's great, that's something we don't see a lot in normal isekai power fantasies. But then the show then goes on to ruin every single one of the characters I'm somewhat emotionally invested in by destroying their characterization. The other heros treat Naofumi like crap and then Naofumi throws away all his edginess and hatred for them to ""have a heart to heart.' wtf? He goes from actually disgusted with them to lowkey annoyed with them. The show plays up Naofumi's trauma with the false rape when they need emotional raphtalia scenes and completely discards that aspect of Naofumi when it inconveniences the plot.In addition: Come on! Raphtalia is not willing to kill the guy who tortured her best friend to death but goes berserk over some idiot calling naofumi a loser??!!Its pretty concerning how Naofumi's teammates are written. Other than the obligatory tragic backstory, the girl's lives seems to revolve around Naofumi and Naofumi alone, every other sentence is Naofumi sama this and Naofumi sama that (which gets annoying pretty quickly).I am so disappointed. I had high hopes that this is was going to be another good Isekai, but i was wrong. There used to be a time where i couldn't wait for the next Wednesday, but now i'm barely finishing an episode when it comes out.",5
the-rising-of-the-shield-hero,I really like this anime and I hate how people are overblowing it with these reasons saying it's promoting slavery and making women look bad for false rape accusation.You guys need to realise that we all have opinions and you know what? maybe all of the things i just said are wrong. Whatever your thinking about whether disagreeing with me or agreeing you could also still be wrong. Stop arguing to other people about who's right or who's wrong because no one is ever right. When did your opinion become so highly important that others need to listen to you? This is MY opinion now if you disagree with me then that's fine. I will not try to convince you or discuss with you how I'm right. But please be reasonable with your opinion and respect others.,5
the-rising-of-the-shield-hero,The art style and animation is very well done in this show. The use of brightness to set the mood and pacing for the show is very well executed. The twists and turns of the path to becoming the shield hero are unpredictable and intriguing. The length of the first episode was a huge bonus. I believe the show would not have been as well received if it was not developed so much from the start. Had it only been 20 minutes it would have felt rushed and underdeveloped. The main character has changed and the other heroes are starting to show their true colors. This show is sure to be full of surprises one after the other. I cannot wait to see the next episode and witness 'The Rising of The Shield Hero'!,5
the-rising-of-the-shield-hero,"This is the second review I've written in here. I do it only when absolutely necessary and I mean absolutely necessary because no matter what kind of anime you like there is no way in this world you will not like this. Music --> PerfectStory --> PerfectCharacters --> PerfectAnimation --> PerfectEverything else --> Perfect (I'd even say 104% perfect)Honestly, there's nothing I can say that hasn't been said in other reviews so just give this a try, it's absolutely amazing. Thanks to this I started reading the novels and they are amazing.",4
the-rising-of-the-shield-hero,"18 Episodes In, Spoiler Warning In-Effect**Rising of the Shield Hero has many chances to absolutely delight the viewership over the course of its run. I usually spend the first three episodes or so giving the anime a chance to hook the audience -- and it usually doesn't take much -- and establish a premise that I can sink my teeth into for the long haul. This anime did accomplish that, and it still manages to keep my attention, I'm just not able to give it five full stars for one very obvious reason:I find it hard to believe that so many people in the established Kingdom -- in various positions of material and social power -- would simply choose to debase Naofumi constantly despite everything he actively does to denounce, avoid, and even flat-out contradict claims of evildoing against him. In a world where cataclysm is impending, and one of your four saviors against it is being shut out of progress because of a criminal accusation (serious as it is, I suppose), it's like everyone is absolutely bent on making sure the world gets plunged into the dark abyss! And nobody is going to bat an eye about it -- everyone just nods their heads to everything the King says, the King's daughter says. They set up three of the four heroes to be pretentious know-it-all players and then immediately go full-ham and decide they should also be ignorant to the very mechanics of the game they're trying to win.I really wanted to give this anime five stars, but I can't. A very, VERY small handful of characters in this show act with any sort of psychological depth beyond ""my friend said so, so it must be true"". They're morons. And because they're morons, the main character is tirelessly dragged through the mud. It's frustrating. And it seems like that is the intent: to frustrate the viewer. Eighteen episodes in and I'd think this tired-out arc of ""Naofumi is being forced to work with three good-for-nothings who are trying to screw him over but is secretly OP"" would have been resolved by now. But it hasn't. I get that people are ignorant. I don't watch anime to reaffirm it. I'm just watching now to see whether or not it's ever going to end so I can actually enjoy watching him fight the waves and POSSIBLY interact with some ACTUALLY INTERESTING CHARACTERS beyond his own party. Minus Filo.Let's face it, she's a flat character. And I'm not being misogynistic.",4.5
the-rising-of-the-shield-hero,"I first came across The Rising of the Shield Hero when I stumbled across a commentary video regarding the controversy surrounding TRotSH. Since SJW criticism usually translates to high praise in my eyes, I had to check it out, and am I so glad that I did. In general, I enjoy the isekai genre but TRotSH is now my favorite of the genre.I enjoyed this anime series so much that I was inspired to purchase the manga series for my kindle app (which was a first for me). Now I await the release of the next amine and next manga for this series.",4.5
the-rising-of-the-shield-hero,"Exactly as the title says. I watched this anime because of the overwhelming amount of good reviews. And I will admit, after watching the first episode, I was excited to watch more. It just didn't hold up to my standards. I'll going to stick to criticism here since there's many other reviews praising this show. NOTE: I tried very hard to not include spoilers but I'm not perfect.Firstly, it's repetitive. The exact details may change but if the same situation happens over and over again you're not going to be surprised anymore. Adding on to this, the show, besides the first episode, is pretty predictable. There's so much foreshadowing that when you finally get to the dramatic reveal there's not really anything to reveal. Secondly, the characters. Some of the characters are fleshed out very well. Most of them, not so much. There are some important secondary characters that are so one-dimensional I known exactly what they're going to say before they say it. And again this adds to the repetitiveness. If they act a certain way ten times, you can be pretty sure that they'll act in the exact same way the 11th time. Finally, the pacing. It was weird. After the 12th episode, I thought the season was over. Then again at the 22nd episode. It had a very dramatic ending that tied back to the beginning and I felt fairly satisfied. And then they kept going. When I got to the final episode, I waited for the next episode not realizing the season was over. So, after all this criticism I will say that it was okay. It was fairly unique. It kept me interested enough to watch the entire season. But it just isn't as good as everyone says it is.",3
the-rising-of-the-shield-hero,"This series is almost perfect. It does suffer from a few cliches and generic situations but Naofumi has some fantastic character experiences, growth,and a great supporting cast in Raphtalia the 3 other Heroes with issues, and some of the royalty. Only removed a star because they're trying to push a harem he doesn't need, and the other 3 heroes are a bit too dumb at first, yet they do show some understanding as the story progresses, can't wait for the next seasons! The lower star reviews hate wayyy too much.",5
the-rising-of-the-shield-hero,"As fantasy fan there are just some anime that can just be really repetitive with the same plot  but different styles or characters that instantly gain a intense power boost in a middle of a fight that and defeats there enemies with one hit every single time that makes you go like okkaaaaaaaay???(Sometimes it awesome but not always)... BUT THIS does and WILL not disappoint you starting from the every first episode. A hero exiled,dishonored and hated by everyone left to grow from the depth all by himself with satisfying fights and comebacks...Now if you'll excuse me I shall be waiting in a corner demanding a next season",5
the-rising-of-the-shield-hero,"Naofumi Iwatani is yet another victim of isekai selection, jokingly and literally speaking. He and three other young adult boys from modern-day Japan have been summoned to a fantasy world, the kingdom of Melromarc, they are to become its saviors. Every generation or so there is a cataclysmic collection of events known as the ""waves"", these hellish storms in the sky signal the end of the world, and bring along creatures of chaos and mass destruction. It is up to Naofumi and the other three to take up sacred weapons bound to the ""four cardinal heroes"" and push back the waves, saving the world. However, Naofumi's cardinal weapon is a shield, forcing him to be reliant on a party to do most of the fighting for him. When no one came to his side, a woman by the name of Malty Melromarc offered her service. Only a day later though, Malty falsely accuses Naofumi of sexual assault. Naofumi, severely punished, discriminated by the whole country,no one wishing to aid him, his fellow heroes abhorred by him, and only a shield bound to him as his only weapon. he is desperate. Fueled with anger and hatred, he works by himself and threatens biased merchants, up until he discovers his only chance left, a slave to fight for him. He manages to find one suited for his needs, a demi-human slave on the verge of death named Raphtalia, this is where the rise of the shield hero begins!It's a long description I know, but the first episode is a whole forty minutes long, context is necessary for anyone reading reviews before watching.The Rising of the Shield Hero has reached critical mass in the anime community, if it can keep it's hot streak going with say future anime seasons or consistent promising releases of manga/novel's for new readers of it's written material. Then we may have the next if not best isekai on our hands. That is if they can keep the fans happy, and the content consistent in the future, but what about the specifics of what we have now? Well straight away I can tell you if you wanna watch an isekai about a calculated cold-hearted badass, than Naofumi  is your protagonist! Hell I'd say he might even give Overlord's Ainz Ooal Gown a run for his money on the badass scale. The Saga of Tanya the Evil's Tanya Degurechaff is much more of a badass devil than both of them, but that's me getting off topic. Naofumi early on takes a mental and physical beating, the events around him shape him quickly into a great character for the fans themselves to flow their frustrations and angers through. Which makes all the payoffs in the anime that much better! Only to then have both Naofumi and the fans cool down when his party members Raphtalia and Filo come on screen. Kinda self-insert like when I say it out loud, but it is and isn't at the same time. Just like the title of my review, Naofumi is essentially an underdog, a damn good one that's awesome to watch to say the least. The world of the anime also feels very lively, making very clear statements and showcasing dilemmas that reinforce that the world is alive, and much more than a video game fantasy. The world feels alive, with the hero's actions affecting it, and Naofumi's journey is a hard fought one because of that. The fighting is intense and strategic, Naofumi's dialogue and actions always have a purpose or goal behind them, and everything he does is important to the progression of the narrative. It's all very exciting and got me hyped up each week. With this review though, marks the end of what we have currently in this anime adaptation, and I'm very excited to become a manga reader! With that I bid you adieu, and ask ya kindly to not let this one slip out of your mind. Add this to your queue today, you will not be disappointed.",5
the-rising-of-the-shield-hero,"The author forces it a bit too hard with the ""Woe is me, everyone sucks and is trying to screw me over just because I have a Shield"" and ""All the other heroes are stupidSpoiler Alert! Click to show or hide(Except the rare moments I need them to not be stupid to move the story the way I want it to go, such as investigating the church and not getting killed in their trap)"" sides of the story, but at least it creates a story more interesting than most in the genre.It would be a 5 star show if the author had written the same basic story without making it feel so forced at times, but it's still a good show/manga.",5
the-rising-of-the-shield-hero,"Refreshingly amazing anime with Beautiful aesthetic design. It has a different story than the typical anime. It tells the story of Naofumi (the protagonist) initially being unfairly treated, used and framed, all due to the fact that most of the country he was transported to wrongly believed the lies and manipulation of an organization that hate the legend of the shield hero. Without spoiling anything else, the rich history, the character development and interactions; the anime's intrinsic storytelling, and insanely cool animation easily rank it - in my humble opinion- amongst the best anime of this year.",4
the-rising-of-the-shield-hero,"The Rising of the Shield Hero is not an anime that I would usually enjoy. Ordinary boy transported into fantasy realm has never been interesting just because the characters almost never feel real. They have no connections or flashbacks to their homes or loved ones that got left behind during whatever incident has sealed them within an alternate realm.  To be honest, this one still has those same problems. But the inclusion of a world that is constantly out to demonize the shield hero and the myriad of interesting relationships, powers, and lore make it far easier to forget about the problems that I see. 4 out of 5 stars for me.  P.S. I do have to say that the other heroes' propensity to believe ludicrous lies with proof of the opposite laid bare in front of them is quite annoying. Especially in the most recent episode as of this review (Ep. 13).",5

But if you have enough patience to get through at least 3 episodes you will have found a real Gem! A real diamond in the rough.

the-rising-of-the-shield-hero,"i'm a little late, but just binge watched what's available.. the lead up to ""thrown into a fantasy land"" wasn't horrible.. he's an otaku, but an average otaku so that's pretty cool.. he acts more relatable than the other heroes.. the contempt toward the shield hero seems a bit overdone to the point i was immediately suspicious of the swindler. although, to be fair, he was one of four summoned and he had Nothing else to go on. i particularly liked when he threw the last few silvers away, it completely set the stage and showed his integrity. i'm hoping we get an explanation later aside from ""shields are less limelight in mmorpgs"" lol.. as for just how horribly he is treated, it seems like a plot device but in honesty i appreciate how well it reflects the less than ideal aspects of human society.. i like the dynamic of his partner, but the 12 to 20 in 2 episodes thing is just kind of obnoxious.. i know they wrapped it up a bit cheaply with that leveling explanation and also tied that down to a demi-human characteristic.. it's just not working for me.. the timeline of impending doom every month is also a big load to swallow.. the battle at lute village was great to watch, but honestly i feel the cast of konsuba would be better equipped against the impending swarms of devastation..i do however enjoy the main character and his approach to surviving.. i don't mind the game interface during the skills, crafting, and battles because inserting mmorpg structure into a fantasy story adds more than it takes away.. i'm curious if he will outlevel the other heroes and at what point they'll need to cooperate.. i got the impression that the ""waves"" are going to get worse and they aren't the solitary problem.. as for the spear hero, i feel his character can go in any direction at this point.. he could be comedic rival, or it can go to a really, really bad place with the influence of the horrible people on his side. it doesn't seem likely though because naofumi's character and good deeds will ultimately outshine harsh rumors and foul play. also i think Motoyasu's character would need to turn into a Complete mindless prick..in any case, the pacing and structure of the show are quite good.. not sure how i feel about randomly bought ostrich turning into a naked cherub girl.. i'm invested enough to watch more episodes.. as long as the direction of the show keeps pace without getting any laziermroarr spice + squirrel girl",4.5

the-rising-of-the-shield-hero,"I became a fan of the series when I started reading the manga adaptation of the novels, and was thoroughly impressed by both the manga and the first episode of this anime adaptation. I like isekai as a genre, but at the same time I'm disappointed with the number of isekai's that are more poorly written (your ""In Another World with my Smartphone""s and the like).  My two favorite ways to handle isekai are explorations of the true absurdity of the genre (a la Konosuba) and the truly horrific/dramatic (like Re: Zero).While we still get some comedic entries for isekai, Rising of the Shield Hero scratches the same itch that Re: Zero did. After an initial twenty minutes of ""oh this is your generic isekai,"" Shield Hero throws a massive wrench into the gears before flipping the table. I enjoy this series and look forward to the rest of the anime. If the quality and faithfulness of the adaptation is the same for the rest of the series as it was for episode 1, then you can bet I'll be watching weekly.",5
the-rising-of-the-shield-hero,"I will update the review at the end of the series.Much like School-life Comedy/Romance was the most popular genre among Anime adapted from light novels of the 2000s, issekai has become the dominant genre of 2010s. Each story is crafted with a main character summoned to another world, which usually resembles an MMO or is an MMO, and each story has their own stick to differentiate them from what would be arguably the most stale genre at this point and the story ends with a main character getting a harem.  Most of the time the Main character is gifted in a way that earns the immediate acceptance from most of the world or at least commands respect.  This ones seems to begin with a very different stick. The Main character  is summoned as a loser, over the course of the first episode for reasons comes to hate the world he lives in. Giving this series probably the a dark and gritty tone that I have not seen since say the Saga of Tanya Evil.",5
the-rising-of-the-shield-hero,"This is a very interesting start. Just like ""That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime"", this one takes a spin on the trope. There is this man, who isn't anti-social, but just a nobody; perfect for Isekai.Opening a book, he is summoned along with 3 others. The only problem is that he is the butt monkey, having a shield and not allowed to use a weapon. The other 3 have their weapons, but are arrogant or jerks.When it comes time to gain an ally, the Shield Hero, gets nobody.Then the formula begins to change, and he begins to adapt, taking on more of an anti-hero. Also this title doesn't seem to be a permanent-isekai, rather, he has to complete his mission before he can go back home.I think this title won't be about trying to rule the world, but rather develop himself into a person with confidence, growing up in a way in a new world, that really isn't meant for people excited to arrive in a new world.",5
the-rising-of-the-shield-hero,"honestly with every isekai anime i tend to go into them expecting the worst since alot of them usually follow the format where the MC is op af and has a huge harem of girls however with this one it's different. The MC at first was living a good life until he was betrayed and lost everything and to top things off he has the ""weakest"" legendary item out of the 4 legendary heroes. looking forward to seeing future episodes and might even read ahead in the manga when i can.",5
the-rising-of-the-shield-hero,"This, so far, managed to have good twists and plot points that did not feel to obvious, it has amazing and simple world building, and manages to keep the edgy main character, while giving them a good personality as well. the animation and sound are really well done, the bits and pieces of 3d animation are hard to pick up on. it gets nearly full marks in almost every way you can judge an anime. as long as it does not go south, we are in for an awesome ride.",4
the-rising-of-the-shield-hero,"I think we have all seen plenty of ""sucked into another world"" anime, and they tend to follow a similar tale of the hero being summoned, and exalted, and either they're working to get back to their own world, or they were so miserable in their own world that they are glad to be here. Usually the plot goes no where aside from that, and it's slapstick-y. Or you can predict how the whole thing will go because there isn't much depth to it.This anime is not that. There are some weird video game-esq items that crop up, but it kind of adds a certain charm to this anime. Instead of having a hero that's exalted, we watch the struggle of someone who cannot catch a break, and how those struggles really shape him and help him grow in the ways needed. Plus, there's a lot of enjoyable moments, the characters are pretty fleshed out, and you truly end up on the ride of this plot. I also really appreciated that the reverse-harem-girls-fawning-everywhere or over-the-top-love-interest was non-existent. There's definitely an undercurrent of emotions, but it is not the forefront of this anime. It's so refreshing.Overall it's incredible, and totally worth the watch. I don't want to say too much else because I don't want to spoil it. Definitely will be keeping my eyes peeled for season two!",5
the-rising-of-the-shield-hero,"Isekai. Traveling to another world from ours. The genre has been very popular in recent years thanks to light novels, but its been a genre used for quite a long time in anime.If you google Isekai you'll see a picture of this anime in the first post. Its there for a reason. The Rising of the Shield Hero is definitely one of the best animes out there and probably the best Isekai (or at least among the best) and this series isn't even done yet (season 2 and 3 are already confirmed which isn't a big surprise after its been such a hit).Without spoiling the story I'll just say this anime features an amazing cast of characters with an also amazingly done isekai storyline. The MC and his companions drive the show though and watching them change over the course of the series is quite a ride from the start of the show to the end. There are no fillers. Every episode leads the plot forwards and develops the characters. The animations, voice acting, music...its just all so good. Expect a good amount of character development/plot development episodes with some good battles and big decision moments done correctly.I've watched the show twice already and will likely be watching it again. Its just that darn good.TLDR list:Harem? No. Cover can be misleading, but No.Romance? There isn't really a ""romance"", but the are a good amount of feelings throughout the series.Comedy? Some, but not much.Action? A good amount.Maturity? Tailored towards adults/teens. It can get pretty darkCharacter development? Tons.Fan Service? Very little.Completed? No.More seasons Coming? Yes and Confirmed for at least 2 more seasons.",5
the-rising-of-the-shield-hero,"I just have to say, this anime might start off a little slow. But, if you give it a chance you will not be disappointed. It has an amazing story and the characters and their bonds are really well developed. Not going to give anything away but I know I am not alone when I say that we have to get a season 2 & even more. I will learn to become fluent in Japanese just to speak to whoever it takes to convince them to keep on producing and making more of this series.",4
the-rising-of-the-shield-hero,"As a person who read the manga first, I am completely disgusted at how badly they ruined Naofumi's character as well as the Queen's.  What happened to the Naofumi that was seething with hatred and vengeance? Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideWhy the hell did he STOP the execution later on?  Why did the Queen hesitate to exact capital punishment on her family for their high treason?  Are these events supposed to make them seem more 'human'?  Bull.  The Queen is just that, a QUEEN.  She is supposed to have an indomitable will to perform any task for the betterment of her kingdom.  Naofumi is a man wronged by a nation, wrongfully ostracized by its people, had his pride destroyed, and was left for dead.  He wants revenge for the hell that he was put through, but at the end of the show he turns out to be a pathetic man that just gives in to his weak morality.Take a quick look over to the same scene in the manga when the Queen indicts her family and it plays out entirely different. The Queen asks Naofumi what he would like to do with them and he yells out, without hesitation, to execute them.  She then explains that she cannot do that, not because of petty personal reasons or emotions, but because that would show weakness to enemy nations and might invite war.  As a compromise, the Queen then suggests extreme torture of her own daughter and husband. Flaying them alive, tearing off their limbs, giving them a world where they'll wish for death. She says this coldly and unflinchingly.  This shocks everyone in the room and leaves Naofumi looking at them in pure hate, imagining their suffering.While Naofumi does still go with the rename of the princess and king, he still maintained that pure anger and loathing he had up until that point. In the show, that anger becomes a pale shadow of what it started as very quickly. To this point in the manga, he is still extremely reluctant to fight alongside the other heroes, only doing so because Fittoria requests he do so or they will all fail. He does not make friends with them and barely tolerates them only after they were put in their place by the Queen.  While his anger is mostly sated, it has left deep scars on his personality, making him a very rough and jaded individual. It's a shame his anime counterpart is such a pathetic meek pushover and in comparison. There are a few other points that I have complaints about, but they are nothing in comparison to the bastardization of Naofumi and the Queen's characters.",4.5
the-rising-of-the-shield-hero,This anime was just amazing to watch and is a nice refresher to what i normally watch. It's been some time since I've been looking for anime that gets me into the story. The story is well written along with great animation plus the character development is just on another level. It reminds me of how the older anime were where they would develop the character and not just do small one offs like the newer anime seem to be doing. The problems that Naofumi faces are relatable to actual real life situations in the sense of how he is feeling and how it affects him not just internally but how he see's things around him. If you haven't seen this yet better get on it and hopefully when they announce season 2 it will be just as amazing to watch as season 1,4.5
the-rising-of-the-shield-hero,"While on the surface this seems like your run of the mill fantasy Anime through the first couple of episodes the situation changes dramatically. Without giving away too much our 'Hero' is soon vilified and turns mean. 10/10 it got me angry seeing what happens to him and it is very rare for any show let alone an anime to elicit such an emotional response from me. Highly recommend just for that, but the general story arc is also very compelling and fun to watch.",5
the-rising-of-the-shield-hero,"Just, take a moment of your time to watch the first episode. You will then be immersed by the story line, a man has a decent life, nothing to do but go to the library when he's broke. (Fair enough) Then he picks up this particular book, and gets sucked into this world that he has no idea where he is at. However, he's not alone. Along with him is three other different people from different dimensions. However, I shall not spoil it any further. Enjoy my friends, have a lovely day.",5
the-rising-of-the-shield-hero,"This show started off amazing. I thought it was going to become on of my favorite isekais. I liked the conflict and the characters to an extent. But, the driving force of conflict in the show (the lies about naofumi) gets resolved. Awkwardly though, the conflict still exists after even though they cleared his name. The bow hero and sword hero are supposed to be smart, but now they are stubborn boneheads? The social interactions seem a bit harem/forced after. I enjoyed the show though overall. It had a lot more potential than it showed in the second half. We will see how season 2 goes.",5
the-rising-of-the-shield-hero,"Overview:A brilliant take on the Isekai genre that delivers heavy punches in the first half, but softens out to a more average, if still well produced, character driven story. Definitely worth a watch, with great visuals, but don't expect to have the same emotional impact as the LN/ Manga does as the story progresses.I would recommend giving this series a watch.Full Review:For me, this series came out of nowhere, and the first episode was such a whiplash of emotions that I was instantly hooked. Within the first 3 episodes, I went to check out the companion Manga, and then the Light Novels as well to catch up on the story. It takes the Isekai genre and tweaks it into something new and different which is always refreshing in a deluge of power fantasies and overpowered LN protagonists.It does stay fairly close to the LN and companion Manga, which is certainly nice to see, and adds enough visuals to really make this a great series. There are some drawbacks to how they adapted the series, however. Most notably is the filing down of the edginess of Naofumi, and the environment in general. A strong start, but I feel almost as if the writers and animators lost their drive to hit as hard as the Manga/ LN does which is the main charm of the source material.As such, the anime starts out spectacularly, but slowly falls into being a high quality but not-as-unique story by the end of the series. By softening the blows the main character both gives and takes emotionally, it winds down to an end after the second major arc completes, and leaves the series wonderfully closed but without the drive that continues the story forward in the LN/ Manga.Some of this drift can even be felt in the two OPs, as the first OP hits hard, gives emotional context, but doesn't reveal too much. The second OP is more of a collection of events that will be happening in the second part of the series, and the emotional context is lost in a future slideshow of sorts. The fluidity of the animation likewise changes between the first and second halves, as does the main method of character interaction. In the first half, a lot of the interaction is done in combat, and the non-combat is montage'd except for important events. The second half focuses more on the inter-character relationships, but loses a lot of the pacing to do so, although it finds its feet again towards the end.Overall, I like how they adapted the series, but think that it does put a cap on the story that continues on in the LN/ Manga which may make any future installments take a different path. I'm not a fan of how much they softened Naofumi up, and downplayed just how much crap he takes, but it did make the anime much less of a continual gut punch, and even gives it a happy ending in what the LN/ Manga have as a small interlude before the next emotional hit.",5
the-rising-of-the-shield-hero,"I have never became captivated by an anime so quickly. Many animes have a long build up period that take quite of bit of episodes/story building before I become fully engrossed. This was not the case with shield hero, within the first few episodes I was hooked. Great plot-line and extensive character development, despite being a relatively short anime (25 episodes, although the story will undoubtedly continue). If you are looking for an anime that will captivate your interest quickly and doesn't require an extensive time investment (100+ episodes), then do yourself a favor and watch The Rising of the Shield Hero.",5
the-rising-of-the-shield-hero,"In my opinion this is one of the finer animes in circulation right now being a hit and spot on depiction of the isekai genre it features many characters that you can relate too and is by far a all around performer when it comes to plot, presentation, quality, and character development. The story is progressing at a moderate pace to the manga and it shows great promise.  Now to just pray they make a game adaptation online or for consoles Like naruto Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideAlso this anime is very detailed and the info screens are not viewed a lot by the anime so do not blame the show if you get confused by some of the terms.",4
the-rising-of-the-shield-hero,"Absolutely loved the main character and his friends.  Animation is great, however there is some rough CGI parts throughout.  Voice acting is fantastic.  Started off really strong but started to seem kind of rushed towards the end but didn't ruin the show for me.  Overall one of my favorite shows I've watched recently, here's to hoping for season 2!  Also must reiterate how much I love the characters!",5
the-rising-of-the-shield-hero,"The creators struck the right balance between showing the slow growth of the characters, as well as pacing the larger story arcs.  Some of the events are out of the order from the novels, which if you've read them, made it kind of confusing, but overall they kept the essence of the conflicts, betrayals, and resolutions together.   I did miss seeing the mountain sized turtle disaster though.Not sure that we'll see any more anime adaptions in this series (which is still on-going), but its a great introduction into this universe.",4
the-rising-of-the-shield-hero,"Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideIn most shows they sometimes follow the cliche of having characters that are ultimately accepted and always reach their designated goals, however this show is different as our main character starts off as an outcast who isn't accepted by any of his pears, it shows the struggles he had to deal with and the experiences he had and is truly a wonderful anime.Hopefully there will be a season 2!",5
the-rising-of-the-shield-hero,"As a first review from me, I can't promise to go into extreme detail, nor can I promise to write a good review.That said, this one shocked me. The character development was astounding to say the least, with a near complete turnaround that wasn't too fast nor too slow, and staying believable the entire time. Naofumi certainly holds top ranking for a character in my eyes because of that. Raphtalia went from a small scared child to a fighter capable of taking on anything else, and certainly plays the part of the Hero's Sword, as well as being a comfort to Naofumi when it is most needed. Heroine of the year for sure with her own development over the course of the season. Filo got the short end of the stick, but still had development worth noting, while retaining the child-like innocence within that growth. There is certainly much more to be done with her.Without getting too far into spoilers, this is a must watch for anyone that enjoys development and world building. The show has it's highs and lows much like any other but the lows are seldom and last for mere minutes at a time. The highs are constant and not always the same. Victories are hard won, with the cliché overpowered heroic boost only seen once the entire run. But even that one unforeseen boost took it's toll, leaving little doubt that the use of such power is to be used only as an absolute last resort.   There is definitely more to be done, but for 25 episodes much more was accomplished than I thought could be done within the first season, assuming a second season is coming at time of writing.",5
the-rising-of-the-shield-hero,"I feel the best way to describe something of this nature is with a 1-10 scale, which I'd give this one a 9.5  (cause nothing is perfect...). I have 4 things I look for: (1) Overall Animation - 9.0. There are very animated feats shy of Final Fantasy that I'd give a 10.0 to, a 9.0 still means it is great, just always something to be desired (due to budget restraints, etc).(2) Action Animation - 9.5, darn near perfect in my opinion. I wish the fights were longer (They are decently long, I'm just greedy because they are awesome). (3) Story/Drama - 10.0. I'm not going to ruin it for you, but man, the drama is real and very powerful. Very well crafted and balanced, you may find tears in your eyes one moment and the next, feel burning rage. This is the sign of a good story I feel. (4) Character development - 10.0. Characters are solid yet flexible enough to flow with the events around them (they are capable of growth and regression). Characters you hate one day may simmer to a more neutral feeling later due to growth. Watching Naofumi's personal growth from the start to the end was quite a journey. I took extra time to write this because the anime is worth it. Truly an anime to watch.",4.5
the-rising-of-the-shield-hero,"This is honestly one of the most enjoyable anime I've watched recently. From start till the end everything such as the animations, fights, character, and the story feel really well done and super interesting. I recommend watching this to anyone who loves Isekai where MC enters a game-world. I would say this that this is nothing like others and has its own uniqueness. Can't wait for season 2.",4.5
the-rising-of-the-shield-hero,"There are anime, where hype is bigger than actual quality of the show... and then there are shows like The Rising of the Shield Hero.Honestly, i was geniuenly and very positively suprised about quality. You can see how much work was put into it- animation is great, art is stellar, story, while having some tropes, is interesting and relatively unique. And characters... honestly, one of best parts of the show. Everyone goes trough more or less character development- now, not exactly on MHA level, but still. Seeing Naofumi, Raphtalia, Filo and others develop troughout the course of the story is real treat to behold!I should probably warn that there are some pretty dark themes in anime, such as false accusation of rape or slavery. First half of season one is definetly more dark. But dont worry, it still has lighter momentsOverall, i have to say this is definetly one of my favourite animes of all time.Cant wait for season 2! Hope it will be announced soon.",5
the-rising-of-the-shield-hero,"There are a lot of positives with this series. The art is great, the characters are interesting (well, most of them), the voice acting is good, and the RPG theme (similar to that of Goblin Slayer) works out great.I'd recommend that any anime fan atleast check it out.Then we have the negatives. 1. The story is good in general, but it is driven in large part by the main characters being temporarily stupid. It's like the writers (much like a certain pair of writers that GoT fans are familiar with) can't write a story with consistently intelligent characters. At several points you'll see characters become uncharacteristically stupid simply because it's needed to start a conflict or push the story forward.2. You don't get to know the main character well enough. His inner monologue isn't always available when it's needed. Many of his reasons will be hidden, and not in a way that makes him more endearing.3. Not enough character exposure. There's probably a fancier way to say it. Like I said, the characters are interesting, and you will probably want to learn more about them. The series doesn't give you enough. It's as if the writers are skipping past a bunch of interesting dialogue and character background just to get to the action.",5
the-rising-of-the-shield-hero,"well, i was not expecting this. i open my Facebook feed and crunchyroll is advertising this show. OK, i mean its been a while. I'll give it a shot, last thing i saw was Jojo. starting from the first episode i became entranced by this show, i needed more, way more. at the time of writing episodes up to 23 are out. and man, OH MAN does this one deliver. you've got some tropes, some 'usual anime' stuff, but this show is so character driven it amazes me. each one plays off each other in a meaningful way, everyone has distinct motives, unique personalities that are not overplayed for edgy or kawaii reasons, and the dynamic is so fluid it felt like some of my best D&D sessions. im like 25 and i cried with the characters. that is weird for me. im stoic at best, but somehow this show caught me by the heartstrings.without spoiling anything, i adore the shield hero, his arc, his journey, i mean they don't call it rise of the shield hero for nothing. he has a relatable character. i found myself so involved with figuring out how he faced his obstacles, showed mercy to those who wronged him, and came out on top of it all. i will patiently wait for more episodes, i am sure they will deliver more of this incredible plot line.",5
the-rising-of-the-shield-hero,"I didn't know what to expect when I began to see this new anime get so much popularity in such a short time span.So upon arrival it came to a shock to me how good it is, leading me to crave for more. After school everyday I would binge watch this with an everlasting curiosity, sparking my imagination even further with this more modern take of an MMO more so a human being trapped in this world and having to beat the levels to escape.On instinct you would compare this to SAO in that world of beauty and a powerful protagonist. That being said these 2 animes are NOTHING A LIKE.The first episode is a shock wave, to me so revolutionary yet so realistic in this day and age as the beginning of this anime is so meticulously put together making you crave more.The animation is really impressive for me in particular.Unpopular opinion; but it makes me want to refrain from reading the manga and YouTube lore videos and savor myself up each week for a new episode",5
the-rising-of-the-shield-hero,I finally watched the shield hero up to episode 21 on Crunchyroll and I really enjoyed this anime so now I am waiting for the rest of the episodes to air on Crunchyroll and now I am really hoping for a second season to the rising of the shield hero. When I watched this anime I really felt sad for the character Naofumi because no matter who you are a men or a woman lies do hurt good people in some cases. Lately I started losing interest in some anime's when they are about the main character being super strong/overpowered like with dragon ball z it is still a good anime but now I am just not interested that kind of anime right know I would like to see more anime where they start of weak but then become strong later. It is sad that some people just can't get passed the first episode of the series but some people have anime's that they like or don't like with me I wish more people would like this anime Seisen Cerberus and I am hoping it gets dubbed in English some day.,5
haikyu,"I am super hyper-critical of anything in the media pertaining to my sports. I played volleyball for about 8 years as a Middle Blocker and occasionally an Outside Hitter (Wing Spiker left side aka Asahi and Tanaka) but Haikyu!! wins everything and probably the sole reason I want to play so badly againThe sequences when they're playing are absolutely gorgeous. True to form and technique it looks like they're really playing. The matches themselves are intense, and I get the same feelings watching them as I did when I played in similar scenarios.I love that each character has a set of defining strengths and weaknesses in regards to how they play. And I love that this is a team that stops the bs at the door and that they can come together as a team and communicate with each other and win.The only thing that kinda irks me is some of the translations on the terminology. I can live with that",5
haikyu,"Haikyu!! is entertaining, thrilling, and is ideal as a sports anime. It has minor flaws, but I'M IN LOVE.  ITS AMAZINGx100001. Characters The characters are different. Unlike what we'd imagine, the main character isn't a complete idiot who ""works hard"" and makes it happen, nor is he an amazing talent. He's just athletic and a giant ball of energy compressed into a boy. He has the right amount of flaws, but is, I guess, the right amount of 'awesome' to make up for it. The thing I like about this character, and all the characters in this anime, is that they're very easy to empathize with. The side characters have hilarious personalities, and weren't just created as generic trash because they weren't the main characters. Thankfully. (My favorite side character is Tsukishima. Man, he's great.) Almost all the characters develop in some way. The changes may seem a little quick to come, but it makes sense. Why did they change like that? It's never some dumb reason, you can understand why and how they develop throughout the anime. Thumbs up for that. 2. Plot In retrospect, the plot is similar to most sports animes. (Joining a club, training to win. Win.) However, instead of just making the goal something cliche like beating a long time rival, there's a small twist! The thrilling arcs and interesting episodes, characters, and games keep the plot from falling flat into a spiral of bore. I also want to cry in happiness and kiss this anime because THE PACE IS AMAZING. The fillers (if they were even counted as fillers) were short, to the point, and wasn't unnecessarily long *coughnarutocough*. They didn't even take up half of an episode. The anime also doesn't drag out the games for 3 episodes; the games are the perfect length to get the thrill, the suspense, and the relief while managing to still keep us on our toes for the next episode. Gawd, it's great. As you might have read from the other animes, this anime is also hilarious. It's not overpowering the overall anime, but there's just enough to keep you laughing throughout the episodes and actually enjoy watching. 3. Art/ProductionThe art is very, very pretty. It doesn't look half-done at all (which was the problem I had with a lot of sports animes) and the characters actually look different, instead of having all the same face but with different hair and eye color. (...) Some have sharp features, some have soft, and they're all built differently so they actually seem like a group of real people. 4. SoundtrackThe opening is not bad, but it's not good. It kind of lacks the hype you actually get from the anime, but no matter, it doesn't hurt to listen to at all. The rest of the soundtracks are well-fit for each scenario as well. The seiyuus (I watched the sub-version) are well fit for the characters. None of their voices are annoying. Yay. SO BADA55. IT'S AMAZING. HAVE TO WATCH THIS GUYS. SDKJHFGFKJH",5
haikyu,"To be honest I didn't find it interesting at all. Volleyball is not exciting to me. Then one day I ran out of anime to watch. Then I was like 'what the heck' and tried out this anime. I  totally regret calling it uninteresting. I wish I would of watched it sooner. This sports anime really keeps you on your toes with excitement, suspense, and anticipation. Let me just say if you think this anime will be a snooze fest well think again, and watch the damn thing. (excuse my language.)",5
haikyu,"Truly in a league of its own, Haikyu!!, with its solid plot, interesting, makes-you-genuinely-care-for-them characters and heart-pounding matches, is what all Sports anime should be, or at least strive to be.A petite, un-athletic girl, I never cared about sports, or competitions for that matter...let alone volleyball. After watching this series, not only did I gain knowledge about the sport and its technicalities, but I also got ""converted"" into caring for the sport itself! It made me see volleyball (and sports in general) in a whole new light that I actually want to try it for myself. For an anime to be able to inspire and spark you into action is pretty amazing, don't you think?Lastly, if there was a standout reason why I enjoyed the series so much, it has to be  the MC, Hinata Shouyou, who is an absolute joy to watch and truly an inspiration worth emanating. He embodies what holds true for most successful athletes: unbreakable will, fierce determination, and the mindset to overcome his physical limitations (his lack of height) and not letting them hold him back from pursuing his dream of becoming Japan's best.",5
haikyu,"From a sports anime fan's point of view, I can say that I really enjoy this anime and find it awesome. Based on watching 8 Episodes, the feels, the action, the pacing, the laughter and the character development are especially there! Needless to say, it compares well to the likes of Kuroko's Basketball and Ace of the Diamond. Where it is going right now seems in the total right direction! Almost every character has a likable side as well! A very good anime to watch and is a must for any sports anime fan!",5
haikyu,"For those of you who don't understand the idiom or think it's a grammar mistake, it's not. In my opinion, the 2nd season should have been announced like 10 episodes in. I've watched Kuroko no Basket's 1st season and enjoyed it, and though I haven't watched the 2nd season yet, I'm glad that its series has been successful enough to warrant a 3rd season next year. I can only hope that Haikyu!! follows in Kuroko's positive reception, and have the production company spit out as many seasons as possible. The characters are lovable, hilarious, and admirable. For those who haven't read the manga, you need to go ahead and do that right now!",5
haikyu,"I was never the biggest sports anime fan, but many people had told me about this series so i decided to give it a shot. Deep down I wondered how a volleyball show would be any good. Immediately I got a certain feel from the show that I hadn't felt before and it keep growing on me after every episode. The cast of characters are brilliant and have enough meat behind them to feel really fleshed out. I didn't know much about volleyball at all, but the show does an excellent job explaining the rules or describing what happened without it feeling drawn out. I played basketball and football in high school and the characters and situations were very relateable. There were actually many moments were I stood and applauded with the team and there were also many emotional moments as well. Lastly I want to point out that the show does a brilliant job showing the opposing side's point of view and even makes you feel a little bad when they lose, even though they're the enemy! I was very pleasantly surprised with this show and I'm very glad I gave it a shot! 5/5 for sure!",5
haikyu,"The characters are all vivid and distinct, with perfect voice acting. It's not a comedy, but the writers slip in small gags with perfect timing. The animation style is clean and always well-executed. I also like that the show shows the team beginning to get along well and that there's some strife at the beginning. This is probably one of my favorite anime in the last few years, along with Chihayafuru. I love this show, watch it now!",5
haikyu,"I love this show! I love the way it keeps you waiting, the way it excites you, the way you feel like you are part of the team. I am a girl so I am not keen to sport shows but, I always check them out. When I checked this out I thought it was okay but, the real addiction came later when I couldn't stop thinking about it. I love wanting to watch a show but only one a day to keep the anticipation going, to keep it interesting. The character evolution is amazing. For example how well they started to warm up to each other in the matches. This show made volleyball more exciting.To be so BLUNT I F______ LOVE THIS SHOW!Please don't delete, it is the best way to express  it....",5
haikyu,"First of all i'm a HUGE sports anime fan and therefore i have watched a lot of shows of the genre.That said, Haikyuu!! is easily one of the best ever created. We have amazing character design, great animation, awesome characters, heart-warming moments, scnes that will make you laugh out loud...Everything is put together perfectly.Is not as good as Slam Dunk because it lacks its sense of ""coming of age"", but it's simply entertaining.",5
haikyu,A lovely animation of the characters' motivation and undying love for Volleyball.  Shows the characters' relationships with each other and their developments along with the moderate pacing of the show. The bromance and rivalry between Hinata and Kageyama was something as a viewer to look forward too. It is a must watch for people who are new to sports anime or have a growing interest for sports anime in general.  Makes you appreciate what the anime has to offer!,5
haikyu,I am not a fan of the anime for Eyeshield21 and Kuroku basketball. But sports anime always have an exciting appeal. But volleyball? I played volleyball in high school. I must see this! Volleyball isn't nearly as mainstream as soccer or rugby or other big sports but it is a sport to be taken seriously. And the main character radiates his passion right away! The characters in this title are not afraid to show a little more emotion. Expect great things from each character as they develop in character and in strength. The animation is pretty fitting in that it gives you that feeling of intense movement and dynamicity.,5
haikyu,"Pros:- Easily one of the best sports titles out- Not a single character is unlikable- No one is a prick this time around- Ending is surprisingly good for what it does- Females are few and far between, but are definitely cute when on screen- Chemistry between the cast of characters one of the best I've seen in recent memory- Surprisingly Realistic for a sports anime, there is never a time when a team is completely destroying another team *cough cough* Eyeshield 21 *cough cough* every game that is played is close and every character minus a few freshmen are utilized.- Bench is actually a factor unlike shows like Kuroko's Basketball where it is not used at all- None of the players feel superhuman. The idea that they are talented stays, but unlike how some other sports titles attempts to show you their awesomeness through super human feats, this stays to the realistic side of things for the most part. If anything is done that seems like it is OP, more often than not it was just luck.Cons:- Ending is not the ending, there is going to be a Season 2, which is nice, but not an ending.- Very little time is made up over the 25 episodes, making this feel like it will be a slow paced show in terms of the timeline- not sure how volleyball is, but this show uses alot of the same animations over and over again to the point where it can wear on you. Spikes are all the same, and usually the setups are the same as well.- Music is sub par this time aroundHaikyu!! in the nutshell: Arguably one of the best sports titles ever to be created, there is no denying it's a fun watch for any anime fan.",5
haikyu,"I really shouldn't be writing a review, because the last episode hasn't even aired yet (I think Sunday is the seasons last episode), but I couldn't wait. I started this anime for the giggles, not thinking much of it. The only other sports anime I have watched is Free!!, so I was expecting Haikyuu to be like that. Boy, was I wrong. At first, I actually REALLY didn't like this anime. I found Hinata and Kageyama to be unbearable, and I remember only liking about 3 characters at first out of the many. However, over time the characters grew on me. Why? CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT. It was incredible to see how the love of a sport is what got these kids to break old habits and form new bonds. While Kageyama still struggles with his past struggles, the fact that he's trying and is WILLING to trust his team mates is a refresher. Hinata's character at first bothered me just because he was so obnoxious. But his seriousness about what he loves to do and his fighting spirit is what finally led me to enjoy his character. I finally realized that my frustrations with these characters were BECAUSE they were good characters. Good characters are supposed to make you FEEL something, whether it's irritation, happiness, motivated. Let me tell you, this show had me on the edge of my seat. I was rooting for Karasuno Volleyball team the whole way, and just WANTED them to win! It was like I was part of the team. They motivated me. This show makes me want to pick up a sport again. And finally, the scene that got me the most:((SPOILER))Episode 24, after credit scene. The fact that this show got me to feel like I was part of the team, and felt like //I// lost the game as well, is something to be applauded. I've BEEN there. I used to play softball, and after a tough game (and losing) we'd all remain quiet, even while we ate. And while we didn't necessarily cry, we sure wanted to. Haikyuu portrayed that feeling phenomenally, and the fact that a sports anime (that some would think is a stupid show about boys hitting a ball), can convey such a raw emotion is something that baffles me. It really is a work of art. ((END OF SPOILERS))There were a few aspects that had me rate it around a 4 out of 5 instead of giving it a full rating. Some parts would get a bit repetitive and boring, and the fact that it took a while for me to finally be enthralled with the show. Anything else I found ""wrong"" would be because of my personal preference of things.",5
haikyu,"I've got to say that Haikyu!! has proven itself a highly character driven show with each new team member having their own unique personality and hang-ups. Some of them do fall into clichéd roles, but hey, no group can be all original. The main character duo in many aspects actually remind me of another main character duo I was cheering for a few years ago - the boys from Ookiku Furikabutte (Big Windup!) and I've gotta say, I loved that show. So if Haikyu!! keeps on course it's got a lot of potential to hang a trophy right next to Ookiku Furikabutte as one of my favorite sports show.My biggest endorsement for the show? I'm not big into sports - any sports - not by a long shot, but I'm big into Haikyu!!Side notes: Even though all the main volleyball players showcased on the team are experienced players Haikyu!! does a good job of explaining aspects of the game to viewers who haven't ever really followed the sport. The team's teacher/advisor plays that ""clueless"" role, but he wants to learn and is enthusiastically dedicated to getting the guys practice matches, a coach, and gives them all devoted encouragement. Some of the characters...well...I still haven't really figured out what role they'll ultimately play; like their female manager who has yet to provide more than an occasional distraction, but overall the team is well rounded, if not a little odd. The boys' personalities at first glance wouldn't seem to mesh at all in places and they clash sometimes, but how they bond as a team is totally believable. The show has also kept adding key players, in believable ways, up until episode ten when all members are re/accounted for and everyone in the opening credits has now been identified. lol Episodes pacing is also swift and seems longer than it's actual 22 minutes.Highly recommended.UPDATE: Now that the season has ended and I've seen all the episodes, I've got to say that I was totally caught up in the anticipation of Karasuno's matches. Especially near the latter part of the season. I love it so much I turned around and binge-watched the entire series again from start to finish. There are so many nuisances that I missed on the first watch through because I was getting know the characters. I honestly can't believe how similar Hinata and Kageyama actually are at the beginning of the show! Their approach to life is so different that their similarities and their want to win volleyball games just doesn't shine through as much as their vastly different personalities. Watching them grow into their roles as players, and not to mention unexpected teammates/friends) has so much more meaning on the second watch through. Now that I've seen all of Haikyu!! I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed the presentation of the games. The show spends just the right amount of time with each opposing school and doesn't ever drag things out for the sake of time. (Spoilers follow!) Deep down I knew that the storyline wouldn't have them winning their final match set against Aoba Jousai, but I was still just as disappointed as the team members! However, the ending is very, very well done and the show lets you down slowly from the climax in a most satisfying way. The final episode is gearing things up for the spring tournament and I really hope to see the story continue with a second season. *crosses fingers*",5
haikyu,"I can't wait until the next episode comes out!  This is a very well done sport anime.  The clash and dynamic personalities, how they come together slowly as a team.  Clever use of the unknowledgeable 'coach' to explain the basics of the game. I always like ones that fully acknowledges weaknesses and how a team comes together to make each other stronger. Reminds me of Ace of the Diamond in a way but more humor in this one. The animation is different but works well with the type of action scenes it has. Yeah it's simple but if you are looking for something sincere and not over the top sport anime it's fun to watch and get to know the characters.",5
haikyu,"...but this has got me going even stronger than Kuroko no Basket!!!!! ~ Hyuu, I'm just loving every second of this series!! If you weren't all too sure about giving this anime a chance, drop that doubt IMMEDIATELY! I'm actually really upset that I started watching this while it's still ongoing because I ran out of episodes way too quickly.The characters are strong in personality and they fit together like wacky pieces of a puzzle! Their interactions are so interesting and diverse that it's hilarious. I was literally laughing so hard at scenes that I couldn't breathe ALSO! I don't think I've ever seen a cuter main character and I mean that personality wise. You seriously get attached way too quickly <3 I cannot wait to see where this goes!",5
haikyu,"I can't help but be addicted to sports novels and manga. So when I finally discovered one about volleyball, I was bound to be hooked-- but this series sure did surpass my expectations! I play volleyball myself, and even though I'm not a guy, I can relate to some of Hinata's insecurities in himself in skills other than spiking. I too have an undying will to get better, so watching this anime gives me reassurance as well as confidence to become a better player by honing my skills. I've only been able to watch the first 3 episodes and 2 minutes of the 4th, but I'm willing to wait! This is the first time I've been this dedicated to watch an anime in so long. Hinata gives me hope to become a better player! This is what anime is all about!",5
haikyu,"I've been looking for good sports animes, but this has gone beyond my expectations. Never in a game was I bored, and for the whole entire show, I was on the edge of my seat, wanting more! As the show progresses, you see how the characters grow and develop, and you fall in love with all the characters, even the rivals. When they played, I wanted both teams to win, and when the crowds were cheering, I chanted along! I was crying and laughing throughout the show. 11/10 would recommend. Can't wait for more!!",4
haikyu,"I don't even know where to begin with this, awesome is not even enough to describe this anime really. I have watched sports anime before, even as a kid. I grew up watching Slam dunk, but after that no sport anime ever came close to being worth watching, not until I gave this anime a try. It didn't just came close to it, It surpasses all sports anime ever made. The main guy? Hinata Shoyo, is just amazing. Two thumbs up for the mangaka for incredible work. All the characters were all well made. No boring episode. Shoyo still gives me chills every time.",4
haikyu,"Memorable characters, realistic struggles (but with the epic thrills expected of a shounen), and amazing sound + visuals. Do yourself a favor and watch it right now.I was always really put off by sports anime for some reason, probably because I thought that any anime about such an ordinary topic was bound to be stupid and over-dramatic. But recently, I was running out of anime that fit all the narrow-minded criteria I had in mind, so I was scrolling down the list of anime on Crunchyroll and decided to give Haikyuu!! a go. I laughed my way through the first episode because it felt over-the-top as I predicted, and I only clicked on the next episode because of the cliffhanger they set up at the end (eternal rivalry denied). I'm so glad I decided to start watching, because once I did I couldn't stop. Haikyuu!! shattered any preconceptions I had about sports anime, because it's so realistic and unpredictable, but also uplifting and epic like any other standard battle shounen. I actually came to appreciate Haikyuu!! even more than those, because it realistically showed moments when the protagonists messed up. It set up its stakes properly, so that the main characters aren't always in a do-or-die situation and protected in 1000 layers of plot armor. Because its a sports anime, and because it's realistic, Haikyuu!! is stunning.",5
haikyu,"And here I thought that I'd never like a sports anime in my life, but I was proven wrong. This show has everything going for it. Intense volleyball action, interesting and likable characters, even ones that are meant to be complete douche canoes can't be hated, what more could you ask for. Also the fact that there's actual tension when they play and don't automatically know if they'll win is quite nice to see. Hoping for that fourth season to be announced soon.Overall, I highly recommend it, even if you don't think you'll like sports anime, like I did. This show might just change your mind.",5
haikyu,"To keep it short, Haikyu!! is an amazing show. It is so good at keeping you engaged if you care about the characters. Notice how I didn't say that you need to care about the sport to like it. If you're an athlete or love a good story with action that can give you the same vibes as a fictional shonen fight can, then you will appreciate this show. The themes and life lessons in this show can hit home for many people as well. After the 1st episode, you will know if you like it or not.",4
haikyu,"Excellent artwork; intense, continuous action scenes where you're swept up in the moment; solid music/soundtrack. Good quantity and quality of humor/comedic relief. Many of the issues I have with shōnen are not a problem here. Screenwriting is solid; there aren't filler episodes; in-episode recap/flashbacks aren't excessively repetitive, lengthy, or unnecessary; plotline moves at a good clip. Main character is energetic/excited but gratifyingly endearing, not obnoxious (a hard balance to find), and all characters are developed at a solid pace and portrayed as three-dimensional. Context and backstories are sufficient enough to add dimension and audience comprehension/sympathy, but brief enough (and timed well enough) to avoid detracting from/interrupting the flow of the main story. My one suggestion for improvement would be additional proofreading for the subtitles, as the grammar often contained errors, particularly towards the end of the seasons. It's been awhile that I've been so emotionally involved in an anime; I binge-watched all three seasons in about three days.",5
haikyu,"I've been MIA when it comes to watching anime for the past 2-3 years. Nothing seemed interesting enough to watch so I would always put whatever anime is popular at the time on my mental ""watch list,"" knowing that I may never bother to actually see it. Anime Expo 2015 comes around and a good majority of the con is covered with Haikyuu cosplayers. Once the con was over, I decided to suck up my unwillingness and watch Haikyu. I don't know how to truly describe my undying love for this series. It not only managed to revive that old flame of watching anime I used to have, but it also made me a diehard fan. The characters are all fantastic with amazing growth + development issues throughout the series. The animation of it is smooth and clean. Nothing's too harsh on the eyes. What I appreciate about Haikyuu the most is that it makes it hard to hate the rivals of Karasuno. Yeah, some rivals are strong, but not enough where you think they're some outer worldly being, bent on destroying anyone and everyone. Some may be cocky or a bit rude, but Haikyuu reminds you that they're just high schoolers with a desire to win at the end of the day. Nothing criminal about it. This is the first series where I can say that I genuinely like or love each and every character, whether they're from Karasuno, Aoba Johsai, or even Shiratorizawa.10/10Will buy all the DVD collections to support this amazing series ♥",5
haikyu,"I instantly related myself to the Guardian of Karasuno, I was great at spiking, however I lacked endurance to block in the front, I'm 5,7 and back in high school I would be that short kid who jumped hella high and spiked with ferocity. However, my legs couldn't keep up with jumping high to spike while being able to block so... with that said I was the main digger for my varsity team, spikes, tips, intense jump serves, you name it I dug them all. Even dug against the mvp for my team during practice who is insanely tall and is definitely considered a powerhouse (mind you I felt the bone in my forearm want to bend backwards...). Even got a kill from a dig where the ball flew back to the opponent's side and hit right on the corner within the bounds.This anime has believable characters, the different personalities and clashes keep things interesting. Just watch it and you'll have a good time for sure.",5
haikyu,"235 five, 11 four, 0 three, 0 two and 0 one-star reviews. At one point it had a 1-star review literally saying ""Why are you reading this 1-star review? Go watch the anime!You can't go wrong with this guys. Haikyu is just one of those series. The pacing is just great, the animation is top-notch, and the comedy is on point, even though the anime takes itself seriously. I really love when they nail that balance.The characters are awesome. Both their personalities, where they all have their own charms, and also their ablilities and playertypes on the court are really interesting. Love Nishinoya,  The Guardian Deity of Karasuno. love Kageyama, The Genious Setter. It's great :DReally, with season 3 coming up soon there's only one more thing I can say:If you're into sports anime just check it out for your self. If you're not into sports anime...You might just fall in love with volleyball, as I did.",5
haikyu,"Quite possibly the best sports anime of all time.You will watch this show.It will move you.You'll feel excited.You'll watch the new episode 2, maybe 3, times in a week.  When it's about to be the weekend you'll watch the first half of the match or training sequence in anticipation of the episode airing.You'll wait, patiently or not, for the simulcast to start.  When the screen starts moving you'll do a little fist bump.  Then you'll notice that crunchyrolls subs don't turn on if you leave the countdown clock running.  DAMNIT CRUNCYROLL!!!!  So you'll refresh and be happily on your way.Then you'll see something kickass, you'll read a neat bit of dialogue, or think of something funny to say, and you'll scroll down to be the first to comment on it!  You're probably not going to be the first to do so, but it's so kickass when you get those 300+ upvotes :DPersonally, I've started skipping the otherwise awesome intros so I can watch the episode uninterrupted and still have a minute or two ahead of people to be the first to comment :DHaikuu!! deserves everyone one of it's exclamation points, hurry up and watch!",5
haikyu,"This is my first sports anime.And I dont even like sportsI tried KNB but, to put it in kinder terms, it seemed kinda ridiculous (laser shooting a basketball is apparently ""totes normal"" in a non-fantasy genre but okay) so I quit halfway the first ep lol but BUTI decided to give Haikyuu a try.ONE OF THE BEST DECISIONS IVE MADE IN MY LIFEThe characters. The plot. All of it is just great. You will FEEL so much. I've watched it 4 times already. You won't regret it. 13/10 would recommend with rice.",5
haikyu,"4.5/5 starsThis anime got me bursting out loud in laughter, to getting teary-eyed, to feeling inspired, to feeling all heart-warmed. It's not only animated beautifully and uniquely, but also wonderfully done: in terms of plot, character development, and balance (such as its ups and downs: motivation, devastation, winning, losing, etc). Not only this is my favorite sports anime (currently, and probably will stay as so), it's also one of my favorite anime overall. I'm not only excited, but thrilled for the sequel to come out! After finishing this anime, I immediately went onto reading the manga (starting from where the anime left off--at chapter 71). And I got to say, it's definitely worth checking out, especially if you enjoy the anime. Edited on: 2/7/15***",5
haikyu,"Excellent characters and a surprising (especially for it's genre) story make this a pretty damn good anime. While it is indeed a ""sports"" anime, the characters aren't the ""I have to win this game to save my family farm"" type or any of that bullsh*t, they really just enjoy playing volleyball. While the main character's team IS the underdog team, it doesn't mean that they've tried and trained the hardest, and that's why they're gonna win; EVERYONE trains their hardest to win, including the opposing teams. Everyone, including the opposing teams, are portrayed as the same: an intense, hardworking team that tries to do their best at volleyball, not some big bad team who only win by cheating. Definitely different in that regard. Sadly, it didn't get renewed for a second season, which is awful.",5
haikyu,"3 Words to describe it: Genuine, Action-filled, HilariousIn all honestly I only watched this anime because I was playing volleyball at the time and though  ""p'eople seem to like it- i guess i could check it out- if i don't like it I can always stop BUT NO this anime turned out to be one of my favorite animes ever! The animation in this is fabulous!  It builds drama in the moments in needs to and underlines notes of humor other times.  The action scenes are exciting and played up/executed extremely well with the animation.The characters are genuine, likable, and are well developed throughout the season.  Their designs are fantastic- Hinata and Kageyama are the perfect pair to lead the show and every supporting character behind them is fantastic as well! Haikyu!! starts out a bit slow (giving backstory and such) but a few episodes in becomes incredibly captivating!  The protagonists are extremely lovable and  - the antagonists are interesting and still have a great level of character development.  Not to mention this show is HILARIOUS! When Haikyu!! isn't building up drama or developing a character it is hard to not be laughing or at least smiling.  I have watched a lot of anime and this one remains as one of the most hilarious ones i've seen! I am super excited for season 2!!!- Delaney",5
haikyu,Before I watched this I always thought sports anime was completely overrated. People that hated sports but loved sports anime made me think the fanbase was just a bunch of girls (even though I am one) that wanted to pick out a husbando from an attractive all male cast. I never believed it when people said they actually enjoyed these for the series. Then one day I was bored and decided 'oh might as well watch an episode' and clicked on Haikyu!! because the cover was interesting. Then after that episode I watched another and another. The characters are interesting and the actual games are suspenseful and I need to always see what happens next. If you are hesitant to watch it please just give it a chance. I now know not to judge anime like this again because If I just skipped over it I would not have gotten the chance to ]enjoy one of the most amazing series I have ever watched.,5
haikyu,"This series is perhaps one of the most thrilling, well-done sports anime I have ever seen. The characters are well fleshed out within the first few episodes after their appearances, have a realistic amount of depth, and surprises from episode to episode occur with great timing. The anime is very humorous when it really counts and surprisingly serious during appropriate times. That said, it was very short.Hoping for more! ~~ Maelstrom",5
haikyu,"The author must really love Volleyball, because they conveyed that across to me and I really love It now. From the beginning I enjoyed their antics, nothing more than normal high school kids that love their sport. Then WAM!!! Like that I was pulled in and treated to a complete series that ran like a,  GOD LIKE QUICK SPIKE!!!! I was, and am, totally and emotionally involved in each aspect of the series.  BROVO!!!!! ENCORE!  ENCORE!   You can almost feel the vibration, from the running and jumping, and of course the slam of the ball hitting the court.    The wave of WOW!! That hits you when you witness a plan come together!You want to cheer for them and pat them on their back, while giving them a towel, a drink and yelling encouragements to them!!!!!!What else could I say about this series, but, WOW!!!! I loved this series.",5
haikyu,"I played Volleyball for about 9 years, including all through high school and man have i got to say that this show is AMAZING! I played wing spiker for all the years that i played the sport and every single thing about this show brings back so many fantastic and vivid memories, every experience of the game is depicted soooooo god damn well that it's almost hard for me to explain it. Watching Haikyu!! is a somewhat surreal experience, it almost feels like I'm playing again and it definitely makes me want to get up and play. This may just be my passion and love for the sport talking but this is just a fantastic anime. If you like bro feels, hilarious moments, and sports then this is definitely for you. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.Did i mention its amazing? Because...well yeah, it is.",5
haikyu,"My sister told me to watch it, and I who had never once watched a sports anime before had little hopes for this anime. I mean, sports was something I personally thought I would never enjoy, being the couch potato I am. However, after the first episode, I was stunned and amazed at how breathtaking the show was just from the beginning, and I thought that maybe after that it would probably get boring. How wrong I was. This anime kept delivering and delivering, and soon I was out of available episodes to watch; yet, I craved more, so I went and read the entirety of all the manga so far, and I still can't satiate my craving for Haikyuu!!. I even read the RAWs, and I'm someone who has always had the patience to wait for translations. Haikyuu!! is the only manga I have looked at RAWs for because there's just a constant need for more Haikyuu!!Anyway, with my obvious obsession aside, let the actual review begin!Plot 5/5The basic gist of the plot of Haikyuu!! is just like with any other sports anime: to win. Though, there's a sort of unique charm with this anime in that it has a smooth flow between volleyball life and their life off the court. Most of the intensity happens on the court and during a match, while the laughs happen off the court, but sometimes (like with the case of Asahi) there will be serious moments that aren't matches. It helps keep the anime ""real"". Also, another thing is that this anime seems to get likened to Kuroko no Basket a lot, especially because of the Light/Dark dynamic between the two main characters (which will be expanded on later) but what Haikyuu!! has--or rather, doesn't have--that Kuroko no Basket does is the lack of ""superhuman"" abilities that's very present in Kuroko no Basket, especially among the Generation of Miracles. In this way, it's a nice breath of fresh air and it makes the anime more believable. Yet, even without the ""superhuman"" abilities, Haikyuu!! still doesn't fail to deliver (or should I say toss, haha) a clutch-to-your-seats match.Characters 5/5Now, here's the aspect where Haikyuu!! particularly shines in compared to most other sports anime, or anime in general: its characters. Everyone is realistic and nonuniform. Hinata Shouyou, who would naturally seem like the never give up and naturally gifted character, is actually just a young boy who's really passionate about volleyball but has only subpar abilities (barring speed and jumping). Kageyama Tobio has exceptional characterization in that one would think he was the cold and aloof kind of person, especially with the rumors of being the ""King of the Court"". And yes, he did seem like a jerk in the beginning, but he turned out to just be someone who was merely misunderstood. He wasn't at all kingly. A little bit selfish, yes, but overall just an awkward, socially inept guy who's a genius at volleyball and just as passionate about it as Hinata. And no, he's not quiet and aloof at all. Far from it, actually. Naturally, these two end up meeting as rivals, and eventually they form a duo. It's at the formation of this duo, where Hinata is the ""light"" and Kageyama is the ""shadow,"" where Kageyama's characterization really develops, because you see him actually making an eventual effort to think of someone else (ie. Hinata) instead of himself.Now, I could talk about these two dorks forever as well as the other amazing characters of Haikyuu, but in general, everyone is basically three dimensional and even the smallest background characters get backstories of some sort. It's hard to hate anyone because there isn't a reason to hate them. They're all just like people; they have their bad sides, but they have their good sides too. There isn't an ""evil"" team, and that's what's so amazing about it. Everyone just really wants to play volleyball, and sometimes, because all the characters are so lovable, it's surprisingly hard to pick who to root for sometimes!Art 5/5Very high quality animation. The art style is nice and simple, yet easily distinguishable. The anime did the manga justice by perfectly mimicking the style and feel of the mangaka's art, and they even managed to polish the mangaka's style to make it nicer. Because of the art style, all of the characters can be considered nice and ""appealing,"" but there is still a huge range of characters while keeping them beneath the boundary of being too over the top. The animation is smooth and oftentimes breathtaking, especially when they're playing matches. The action scenes are especially very nice because they perfectly capture moments in what feels like real time, fast and quick-paced much like how real life volleyball is, but during critical moments, it will get slowed down a bit to build up tension and anticipation. Everything flows well together and I still haven't seen one scene that is of bad quality.Overall, this is a very nice and polished anime and is true to the manga. Highly recommended, even to viewers who aren't inclined to watch something about sports.",5
haikyu,"At first when i saw this anime i was putting it off for awhile because i thought it was just another sports anime (which it is but its MUCH MORE). I decided to watch it two days ago and i finished it in one night! Its amazing, the story line and the characters are great, and the adrenaline i get when watching this anime feels great! usually when i watch an anime i take awhile to watch because the first couple episodes move the story way to slow. but right when i watched the first episode of haikyuu I WAS HOOKED! i definitely recommend this to everyone!",5
haikyu,"If you like Kuroko no Basuke, FREE!, or Prince of Tennis, then this is perfect for you. If you're looking for something funny and something to just watch for fun, then this anime is also for you!I love this anime and manga so much because it's just quirky. It has the right touch of bromance that's not cheesy or overwhelming like Free! but it does have the same ambition and quirk like Kuroko no Basuke. The main characters are awesome and it's about time we had a good volleyball anime happen! Give it a try for yourself!",5
haikyu,"Honestly, where every other anime of the season disappoints, Haikyuu excels. Maybe it's just because I already have a love for sports anime, but even where anime like Kuroko start to bug me because of the ""super powers"" Haikyuu keeps the powers out of the show. It's so refreshing!All of the characters are so strong and rounded, I'm having a hard time picking a favorite! I know I'm going to be dropping a lot of money on character merch because of that, aha!",5
haikyu,This isn't a great review but all I want to say is that this anime is great!! I was reluctant to watch it since I was recommended it because it was about volleyball but it's more than that. It's one of those anime that leave you agitated after an episode because you have to wait one more week for the next episode to come out. No matter what your anime preference is this is sure to get you hooked. The characters are subbed perfectly and the development has been awesome so far it gets you excited. You have to credit the character designs too because it doesn't look like your typical cheesy types. Intro song awesome too.,5
haikyu,"This anime wasn't what I was expecting.  It was/is better than that.  I thought that this main character was the crème de la crème and was going to deal with his first rival throughout the series.  But, after the first two episodes, you realize that it isn't that at all.  The main character is inexperienced, but, he wants to live the dream and do his best at the sport.  His first rival on the court soon became his best ally and a way to fix his inexperience.   It is amazing how they work so well together, thus bringing up the saying ""Opposites attract.""  This anime is really good and I do recommend giving it a shot!",5
haikyu,"I was browsing through CR popular list after catching up on all my shows and reluctantly came across this awesome anime. The superb character development makes me appreciate and love something about all of the characters. I ended up watching all 9 episodes in one day and was completely hooked. If your into sports anime, then your at the right place. There is a perfect combination of comedy, drama, art, and depth in this series that will make you eager to see the next episode. Easily a 5 star anime!",5
haikyu,"I usually don't like sports animes, but this really surprised me! I love the unique and bold characters, the animation is wonderful, and the voice acting is good too. Though some aspects are a little generic, it's hard to make such a creative anime out of sporsts, and this is very well done. I recommend it to anyone who liked Kuroko no Basuke, or just anyone who likes some nice, simple, but still good anime. Even though i've only seen 7 episodes, it's going up there with my favorites. I even started reading the manga because i couldn't wait to know what happened next XD",5
haikyu,"Just saw the 7 episodes and must I say... wow. The animation is great, the characters are interesting and I'm looking forward to the next episode. Honestly thought that I wouldn't like watching a sport anime but I was pleasantly surprised- though how serious they are & how much thought they take into volleyball is a little alien to me personally, I will definitely watch this entire series. If you haven't seen a sport anime before, I suggest you start with this!",5
haikyu,"Even though there are only a few episodes as I'm typing this, I think it's fair to say that this is going to be an excellent series. After watching the first episode I immediately fell in love with the characters, the art style, and the sport they play, leaving me hungry enough for more that I read through the available scans of the manga in a couple of weeks. Now I can't wait to see their thrilling matches in motion. The series is well animated with nice music, and the voice actors do very well in portraying the characters' personalities. The writing is fun and hilarious at times but evokes strong emotion when it needs to.My only gripe is this; while the male cast is colorful and interesting, the female manager, Kiyoko, is rather lacking. It feels at times as though she only shows up long enough for someone to comment on her beauty, and she barely talks or shows any emotions until fairly far along in the series. It's not enough for me to drop more than one star, but it does bother me at times.All in all, it's got amazing potential and, to sports anime fans like me, I can't recommend it enough. Even if you aren't interested in volleyball, the charisma and depth of these boys are sure to draw you in.",5
haikyu,"I agree with the review about the knb vibe. After the third ep, I do feel like there could be some rather nice character development/friendships brewing. That's a BIG thing for me in any sports anime, the teamwork and determination really makes the sport so much more appealing. Once I fall in love with the characters, I will love the sport as well. Since I'm so impatient, I'm probably going to start reading the manga now. xD",5
haikyu,"I Hated volleyball and said what the hell and watched this show. It became my favorite show. I loved this show so much that I even tried out volleyball. I actually respect the sport a lot more. But that is beside the point, the show is brilliant. They have brilliant writing, great visuals and nothing that is too unrealistic. There is amazing character development and most of the characters a re really likable in their own unique way. F*cking amazing show.",5
haikyu,"I've never played volleyball outside of school PE requirements so when I started the series I had nothing to go off of. But quickly, I fell in love with the mindsets and drive all the characters have for the sport because it reminded me of when I used to play soccer. That rush of when you're trying to score and then the feeling of when you do. This show nailed it and had me cheering with excitement every game and practice. I wanted to see the boys succeed, I felt for the older guys who were running out of time and wanted to win finally.It's a good anime and I'm rewatching it again lol",5
haikyu,"The first time I watched this, it was because my sister forced me to do it. I figured an anime about volleyball would be stupid and boring. This show is neither of those things.Haikyuu is really good at pacing, storytelling, animation, excitement, all those things. But the characters, man. The CHARACTERS. The characters are the absolute highlight out of all these amazing details, and they're what really makes someone love this show. Almost no characters could be called one dimensional, and the show makes it difficult not to care for all of them even when you're supposed to be rooting for the main charactersI love this show. My anime-intolerant friends love this show. My mom loves this show. Everyone loves this show. Watch the show",5
haikyu,"Haikyu!! has hands-down my  favorite animation style out of all the animes I have watched in my life. For no reason at all I just randomly started watching this show with my intense bias against sports animes. I just decided, meh, volleyball? why not give it a shot. Boy, am I glad I did. You want to root for the main characters so bad throughout the entire anime which is makes the plot intense, involving, and rich. Aside from the fantastic development of the show, I have to come back to the animation. Haikyuu!! is truly the best art I've ever seen and it also has one of the best openings, Haikyuu!! OP 04, it sends literal chills down my spine.",5
haikyu,"haikyu is an anime that exceeded my expectations. everything was great. the animation was well done and all the characters had a set of strengths and weaknesses. i love how they made us cheer for every team. that the opponents weren't just antagonists, but people who'd also worked extremely hard. i enjoyed the different story arcs, and the intro was good as well.  this series is just overall amazing and it's a 5/5 for me!",5
haikyu,"This was my first sports shounen, so I do have a particular soft spot for it. But, that's not to say that it isn't good. It's definitely one of my top 10 animes, personally. I've watched it about 10 times (even got my mom to watch it multiple times with me) and it always fills me with pure joy and happiness when I watch it. I love the characters, the pacing is great, Production IG does another great job in animating this series, and it's pretty accurate in portraying the sport (played volleyball for a number of years). This is seriously one of the best out there and I cannot wait for season 4!",5
haikyu,When I first  saw this I didn’t think it would be that good because it’s just about volleyball but it turned out to be one of my favorite series’s. The characters are so lovable in hiakyuu and seeing the characters grow is even more amazing.I really love this anime even though I don’t like sport in real life. I highly recommend you watch this series.Im also reading the manga right now and it’s also very good,5
haikyu,"This anime is amazing. I love how you fall in love with every character even if they are on the other team. It shows that everyone wants to win and has high hopes and dreams even if they know they are not the best team competing. The animation on how they receive, spike, set, etc. is very realistic. The music is so great. The games are intense, the feels are sooo strong and can hit you like a bus, and the humor is spot on. I have watched this anime 5 times (I know I have no life 0-0) and I'm up to date on the manga and rereading it atm ( about chaptrer 83). I highly recommend p.s. the character development is just straight satisfying SEASON 4 HYPE",5
haikyu,"This was a brilliant anime. I think that it has amazing animations, a nice soundtrack and the way, the show presents volleyball is really good.I personally did not know anything about volleyball, yet I fell in love with this series. The characters personality is deeply explained, with stories about their past. I like how there are no real ""bad guys"" just the opposite team.You will definitely like this anime.",5
haikyu,"Minor spoilers (in particular spots, caution!) detailing first few characters and general topic/thoughts over Haikyu!!'s ""philosophy""/values in my eyesFor quite a long, I've been extremely competitive in almost everything I've done in my life. Even when I was young and didn't understand much, I put as much effort as I could. Eventually, I became more serious, more understanding, and continued to grow in thought. Because of these contributing factors and a recent involvement in Volleyball (around 3 years now, also I have family members who played a lot of Volleyball today and before), I feel a deep connection with the show and the characters created here. Shōyō (""Short"" Orange-hair) from the beginning resembled myself for his youth, passion for Volleyball, and his ability to keep working hard even though he is against obstacles. Hinata never stops trying and is continually inspired to become the best. My favorite character, however, is Kageyama (Tall Black-hair); he may feel egotistical and rude to his fellow teammates, but he is just another perspective to the world of competition. Possibly a darker side of competitive people, Tobio is still trying to become the best and striving to better his teammates in the game. In combination, the cast in Haikyu!! are pieces of different competitors, placed in different stages and situations in their careers, they perfect each others' holes and want one another to become better for tomorrow. Haikyu!! may be about sports, but they also include the lightness of High School (school-life), friendship, and being on a team. For example, Tanaka(-senpai, the ""baldy"" with the buzz-cut) is hilarious and keeps the mood uplifting. Captain Daichi (Dark Brown-hair with a kind of square head) is a great example of a young leader who sees the best in people. He knows he may not be the best, but he is dependable when the other players feel discouraged and puts his faith in the others by believing their abilities will lead the school to victory. I give my respect to Sugawara (Dark Grey-hair with the mole near his left eye) because of choice of being a great teammate; he teaches his teammates and acts another guiding figure in the series. He is there to continue pushing the other players (mainly Kageyama) to maintain their training and not become stagnant in learning. It also helps on the creativity of the animators and other staff where they make the characters have funny expressions as well as scenarios. There is a correct balance between the action and comical relief that reels me in staying around to watch.Haikyu!! on the surface may not seem flashy, but it is definitely is exciting to watch. The reason it is, is because the characters are energetic and are always ready to practice more and more. Each person is exceptionally likable because of their diverse attributes that build their character. I adore the anime because it adds an element of thinking and strategy into it. All the characters have strong development throughout the episodes and become a better team. It's something I want to experience; that's why I'll keep my head up, not fall, and continue to be fired up, in order to just feel my importance to something's entirety. Thanks for reinforcing that ideal to me, once again. I'm thankful for this series and hope for its continued success and praise! Each player in Karasuno high school are important to their success; they all know that. You are not alone, everyone is right behind you. As long as the ball is in the air, the game isn't over. Continue to work hard ! ~~~That's why they are passionate for their position and aim for the right to soar. The development of the characters is something that hits close home and probably to many others out there. There is a lot of metaphors and things you can learn from, some are basic, some take more thought, some can only be found from particular perspectives. I feel as you grow and change into someone more refined, Haikyu!! will be there for you to re-watch and you'll discover something new that hadn't appeared before. If you or someone you know are a fan of volleyball, sports, or anything that is competitive, you/they should watch Haikyu!! because of the competitive spirit and fire that explodes in every episode! It is fun and relaxing as well as being seemingly stressful and intense! Nothing beats trying to be the best to me!",5
haikyu,"I have never  really  been interested in sports.  I had always thought most sports were boring- especially a sport like volleyball. So I was quite skeptical when my friend told me to watch an anime based on it. But I decided to give it a chance because I wasn't really watching any other anime at the time and felt like being open-minded.It didn't take long for me to get hooked and in full-binge-mode.  The more I watched, the more I became enthralled by the characters and their dynamics; their motivation and ambition were deep and contagious. I began rooting and cheering for them in their games because I truly wanted to see them succeed and win. They do a great job at explaining volleyball in depth and go through the importance of each and every role and position. It made me realize how deceptively simple volleyball was. I had always thought it was just a glorified game of hot potato over a net- I was definitely wrong about that.Anyways, upon completing this anime- it became my #1 favorite anime ever. It made me interested in sports for the first time in my life and gave me a story I wished would never end. I simply cannot recommend this enough.",5
haikyu,"This anime is honestly one of the best I've watched. I've played volleyball for 2 years, and the knowledge of volleyball put in Haikyu!! surpassed my own. It taught me a lot of things that will be helpful to be in the next few years. Haikyu!! has a lot of intense matches, and a lot of comic relief to counter. I found it extremely enjoyable to watch.Haikyu!! has lovable characters that are easy to connect with. By the time you're done watching the anime, you don't really dislike anyone. No character is the cliché overpowering impossible to beat protag/antag, but there are obviously some well-rounded players. Every character is good at what they do, and when you put them together, they're a great team. Everyone has their strengths and weaknesses.The person I really connect with in this anime is Nishinoya. I'm around the same height as him, and I can't jump very high like Hinata. So libero is where I'm the most comfortable. Nishinoya is also an enthusiastic and energetic person, so just watching him jumping around when Karasuno scores a point makes my day.I also like that none of the characters are really antagonists. They're just opponents reaching for the same goal. Every team Karasuno plays against is different, making each match exciting and new.The art is breathtaking, and nothing in this anime goes to waste. All the growth made in the characters and the plot are put to use. The music is also amazing.I really like that there isn't much romance in this. Yes, there are a few characters who obviously have crushes on others, but nothing really escalates. Which is great for me, because I'm not a huge fan of romance.",5
haikyu,"This Anime is fantastic for volleyball lovers and those who've never dipped their toe into the pool of ""Sport's"" Anime! The story is very focused and realistic. Character development progress's very well with ALL OF THE CHARACTERS. Having good development for one or two characters is always great but, when the story can encompass everyone and make them very individual its almost unheard of in an anime. Literally everyone has an important role on this team they're all on.My favorite things about this Anime:- Does not dip into romance of any kind but, does have your classic hottie that motivates certain people.- Classic ""Punk's"" or ""Tough"" guy's- Confident characters- Intro and Extroverts- Timid Characters- HILARIOUS CHARACTERS (along with scenes)- Knows when to be serious and throws in some serious ""feels"" when they play volleyball winning or losing.- Pace in this show is perfect, not too fast or too slow.Please, go watch this without hesitation and you will enjoy this",5
haikyu,"Gotta admit that i was a little skeptical at first about watching this one, but wow am i so glad i decided to watch this. Every episode keeps me glued to my computer screen and leaves me wanting more. The characters are just amazing and their growth throughout the series really shows. The way they interact with each other sometimes just cracks me up. I'm not even a volleyball person but this anime makes me want to actually play it to feel as cool as they do. A must watch for sports anime fans, and even if you're not into sports anime, still watch it you won't be disappointed!",5
yatogame-chan-kansatsu-nikki,"short, ""cute"" but unless you want those and the Nagoya reference is not really worth the 3 min. It's rough to translate well  and without the viewer having at least some colloquial Japanese to understand what was said, even the subtext translations skipped over some.translation. My guess is because the ""adult"" context the joke.which isn't adult context in Japan.As for Prejudice: For someone to review it and give it 5 stars while writing ""I can't tell you how frustrating it is to not understand what is going on""  & ""i'll give it a 5 star since I don't want people to prejudice this anime for bad reviews"" is prejudice.",3.5
yatogame-chan-kansatsu-nikki,"There is no other way to properly describe the show other than short. Short main girl, short run time, short budget, and generally short on jokes. It's joked that it's from Nagoya, that's it, mind you there are other jokes there, but they are all in service to the fact that it is, in fact, in Nagoya.If you seriously having nothing better to do with your day and looking for a brainless show, there are worse ones to watch.",2
yatogame-chan-kansatsu-nikki,"When you want to watch something but don't have time to watch something longer, this will do.  There's a joke or 2 per episode, you might learn 1-2 things about Nagoya, but it tends to leave you feeling unsatisfied.Long story short, new kid in town moves from ""The Big City"" to a smaller (but still decently sized) town where he tries to befriend a native with something resembling a Scrappy-Doo complex.  (Surly over the superiority of her hometown.)  Because of the native's town-pride / insecurity, she reacts badly to the newcomer.This is a little bit of a comedy, a little bit ""here's how Nagoya and Tokyo differ"" and not much else. This could be a good promo for a decent-sized comedy, but as is, it's spackle to fill in the gaps in your schedule when you don't have time for a full-length show.",3
yatogame-chan-kansatsu-nikki,"I normally hate short episodes, because they're to freakin short! However this just has that spark in comedy to it that is just bloody amazing and worth catching up on...Done!",3
yatogame-chan-kansatsu-nikki,"I usually love cat animes, or things like that. But unless you get the cultural differences between Nagoya and Tokyo, which seems to be the main focus, you probably won't understand much of what is going on. The cat part is only childish and secondary from what I've seen so far. A bit early to say its real rating, but for now, it's a 3. But, I was actually happy the anime was short at 3:30 to be honest, as I wouldn't be able to take the brain numbing censored sexual innuendos and main focus of Nagoya is lolz for 30 minutes. Will keep an eye on the next few episodes, but for now, it does not deserve a spot in my endless queue.",2

yatogame-chan-kansatsu-nikki,"This Anime seems to have potential, that is until you see how short each episode is. When I saw the cover art for this anime I immediately assumed it was gonna be really good so I decided to watch the first episode. Don't get me wrong it wasn't bad but they made the episode way too short, I can't tell you how frustrating it is to not understand what is going on. All though the episodes are extremely short, it has a cute animation and I do believe it has potential so I guess I will stick around for more to decide wether  or not is good. For now i'll give it a 5 star since I don't want people to prejudice this anime for bad reviews.",3
rwby,"When I saw RWBY on Rooster Teeth, I gave it a try because it looked interesting. As it turns out, I enjoyed watching it. The animation is cool and the plot seems like it could get interesting. I also really like the music, namely the intro. All in all, it's obviously not the best anime out there. The people in the background are just silhouettes and the show is on a pretty low budget. However, I think it's pretty interesting and for 5-8 minutes of my time per week, I'm not complaining. p.s The show improves with every episode.",4
rwby,"RWBY is not about the definition of anime per se, but an encouragement to the artform we have been watching for years from an American perspective. The episodes are a mix of light hearted fun, likeable characters, and a little bit of genius for the fight sequences. The story follows four girls at a boarding school that specializes in the training of cutting edge warriors that protect society from an encrouching horde of monsters. Initially they have to overcome the differences on the inside before they can unify to overcome evils without. Rather than harbor preset expectations about voice acting, 3d cell rendering, or episode length when compared to the Japanese production houses that have been creating wonderful entertainment media for decades now, I think an open mind is needed. This isn't a first class trans pacific jetliner, it's a jet propelled ninja backpack, it isn't the latest Sony Vaio, it's the first Macintosh. It isn't a watershed moment for every anime critic, but I think the essentials are more than enough present to encourage what it already has going for it. For a show about killing monsters, please don't be a monster. For a show called Ruby please don't toss out the diamond in the rough.",4
rwby,"Rwby's Pros out way it's cons and it's only getting better. Overview,Music:Top notch, Jeff Williams delivers and even if you despise everything else it's soundtrack is incredible.Action: Monty Oum's bread and butter and it shows. Excellent fight choreography and clearly Monty and the laws of physics had a falling out at some point because Rule of Cool is in full effect and it's all the better for it.Story: So far, nothing we haven't seen before, school for fighting monsters, creatures of darkness, If you are into any type of fiction then you've seen the premise. That said, it's way to early to be certain of where it may go and with multiple seasons confirmed there is ample time for them to subvert there premise or introduce more original plots. Also, it needs to be said that even if they don't do that, not having an original premise is NOT automatically a bad thing. If it's executed well that's all that matters.Animation: Needs work, outside of fight scenes it tends to be awkward and objects tend to clip. Lip sync needs work but has gotten better from the first episode. If it follows the pattern RVB did then we can probably expect to see them improve over time.(Compare RVB Season 8's CGI to Season 10's)Voice Acting: Better then the Black and Yellow trailers would have you believe, much better, but not perfect, most of the principal cast are new to voice acting so there delivery can be somewhat stiff and lack emotion, but again from the trailers to episode 1 to episode 8 you can hear the improvements.Overall: it still needs work, but know new show doesn't. Flaws in animation and some amateurish voice acting don't take away from the Incredible music, awesome action and so far, a likeable cast of characters. It will fix what is not great in time and like I said its already only getting better.",4
rwby,"I'll preface this by stating that I was a fan of Roosterteeth before RWBY, so I am biased towards their work.In my opinion, RWBY is good. Produced by a small studio, it goes above and beyond what one might think it could be. The animation during everyday interactions can be a bit rough and seem a bit disjointed (Ruby can vaporize cookies on contact with her mouth). The voice acting can be a bit forced in places, especially in the trailers. And there are quite a few cliches.But RWBY has a lot of heart. It is very easy to love the characters and they each are memorable and special. The fight sequences are crazy (in a good way) and the animation there is much more fluid and fun. And the music is FANTASTIC!  The show really picks up momentum and gets better and better towards the end. The episodes are short, but it's nice for when you just have a bit of time and you want a fun little watch that will make you laugh.RWBY is good. It's not God's gift to mankind or the best thing since sliced bread, but it's fun and cheerful and enjoyable and good.",5
rwby,"When I first tried to watch RWBY I was shocked at the 3d animation. But after about 10 minutes of watching it becomes normal, it is very immersive and provides for very brilliant action scenes. The character development is there for all main characters, (and well done), plot line is clear and understandable, and the characters are extremely likable and enjoyable to watch. I definitely recommend anyone to watch this show.",4
rwby,I have to say I've never been more impressed with this anime. Yeah its made in American and thats were alot of the markets moving. Can't really control that if you wanna keep the style alive. that part can be a little disconcerting but its something I've learned to look past.This anime goes above and beyond for series that goes for anywhere between five to ten minutes. and it accomplishes story wise in five to ten minutes what takes a half hour or godsakes three episodes at times to accomplish. its been great ride and good show to what others can do.,5
rwby,"I've watched the first couple of episodes and this is a good anime, because it has all the hallmarks of historically good animes. Clever dialogue, quirky personalities, awesome fight fx (sometimes a bit overkill-ish), and an interesting story pace. Characters are super attractive, dynamic and interesting, likeable within a short span after introduction.Who cares about where it comes from. Good anime can come from anywhere there is a desire and capability to produce great anime, be it Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam, USA, Russia, whatever. These artists too grew up on the same great art form from the motherland (Japan) that the rest of us did.Give em a chance to spread their wings for the sake of the future of this art form we all love and cherish.",4
rwby,"RWBY has been one of the most ground breaking animes in years. and its grabbed audiences all over the world in less than two seasons. it entered the scene with some rudimentary animations and story but as season two continued to play out its animations have continued to improve and its story has opened and unraveled in some very fun ways.but despite its success and fan base its been under attack by the weeboo minority. individuals that believe anime should only be in Japanese and made in Japan. They believe that animes should only come from mangas and be made from manga drawn animations (no improvements or adaptations allowed) and story have to follow a rigid guideline. The problem is even Marvel and DC comics can't follow this to the letter so why do weeboos expect the same from all of Anime. this on top of the fact that half these guys are also closet lolli pedophiles.This is the same crowd that believe that the horrible reboot of Rozen Maiden was God and RWBY should never have been! they exist on a standard of double standards or no standards at all with no principles at all. The anime community will die it follows the direction of this Sci-Fi minority. The bigger problem as I keep pointing out in previous reviews is Weeboos. As also pointed out by one of the greatest anime legends to grace the art Hayao Miyazaki. He's continued to warn that the industry is being ruled by the Weeboo minority and not by fans or good animators. and good animators can come from anywhere Japan USA UK Canada, Europe China doesn't matter, they can come from anywhere and so can the fans.Despite this RWBY has shown the Weeboos are a minority. They'll keep hating and dropping BS reviews (on here especially). But RWBY has given anime a new lease on life, for this stands head and shoulders above the rest and is a classic in the making.",4
rwby,RWBY comes straight out of the mind of Monty Oum and has been dazzling audiences for a couple years now. Teaming up with the guys that brought you Red vs Blue to create a CGI anime. This anime may not always be visually dazzling but it has been making strides in improving anime and expanding story as all animes should anyway. but the best thing about RWBY is how much content there is in the anime vs other animes. This anime can fit a half hours worth of the story and content in ten to fifteen minutes. its been a revolution in the making.,5
rwby,"The Bad:-Script. It is not horrible but paired with the poor voice acting at the beginning, it was a little cringing.-Animation. The hair, the mouths, etc. distract your attention from the show.-The episodes are too short to be absorbed in the show's world each week.The Good:-The MUSIC! Very fitting and great to listen too. - Action scenes. Though the animation doesn't fit for everything else, it does very well for the magic action scenes and different effects (like the flaking petals) make this extremely enjoyable to watch.-No ridiculous or obnoxious fan-service.The Getting Better:- The voice acting. It has improved since the trailers and first couple episodes but still much room for improvement remains. -The Plot. Yes, it appears very stereotypical, but I have faith that it will improve.-The characters. They are very one-dimensional now but they are beginning to have a little more depth. More soon to come I hope.",5
rwby,"Rooster Teeth have done a lot of amazing things, but never have they generated any  original content of their own. As their first original creation, RWBY does not disappoint. Although many criticize the series 3D animation style, it is the very thing that gives this series a flair. The amazing graphics and effects that 2D animations are not able to obtain are all prevalent in the weapons and even the characters. As for the story, it seems simple on the surface but it is seemingly more complex as the series passes by. What you thought was just the White Fang seeking chaos and control now involves the story of Ruby and Yang's origins, as well as a lot of other internal conflicts. And better yet, romance has finally come into play. The characters are all unique, whether they're quiet and harsh, but also fun-loving like Blake, or Cute, querky, and caring like Ruby. What I'm amazed by is how the developers are even able to keep up with their color name system, which I am barely able to upkeep with my Fanon characters. Now, for the most attention grabbing aspect of RWBY, the action. There is a general rule that most actions should follow to become very successful, and that is a unique aspect to the world's fighting. That aspect is the transformable weapons, aura, and dust. The most eye-catching thing about the action is the extremely fluid animation that many 2D animations just can't do. Every single fight in the series so far has gotten me on the edge of my seat and overflowing with awe, with the only 2 reasons being: (again) the weapons and the fluid animation. Overall, I'd recommend this anime to anyone who is a newcomer to anime, or someone who's looking for something new.",5
rwby,"I'm not going to pretend this is an outstanding series: it's not. In fact, it’s not very impressive at all for a vast majority of the time, and is upsettingly overrated. It does however have redeeming qualities sprinkled throughout that may or may not warrant a viewing, depending on what interests you I guess. I'll start with the positives.The art direction is generally pretty good. The design of the Grimm is fascinating, the sets and scenery can range from good to great (they get better every season), and the costume design is very good, for a few reasons. Many of the characters are designed after historical or mythological figures, and that design will also tie into their personal fighting style, personality, and story arc. What's also interesting is that the coloring schemes are used as a story element—exhibiting certain character traits and plot foreshadowing on a level that will surpass most shows of this trade.The last few points also tie into the lore and story, which are thoroughly designed by show creator Monty Oum. The lore is very detailed and thought out in a way that would require some outside reading for most. Since Oum's passing however, it seems that Rooster Teeth will be taking the show in a different direction than the creator's plans. Though such an executive decision is disrespectful, and frankly upsetting, this review will focus on what *is*, rather than what *would be*. He went out with a surprisingly weighty third season though, with a level of peril and scope that redeemed some of the series' more prevalent flaws up to that point. After that, there is a dramatic quality decline in season 4 that would suggest the writers were replaced by middle-schoolers.I’m going to keep Rooster Teeth’s politics in the review’s score to a minimum, but there’s no other way to describe it other than disgusting. They declined Oum’s wife after she revealed that she was aware of Monty’s plans for the series, and also proceeded to fire a majority of the animators, choreography team, and writers that had ties to Monty, only to write in their character inserts as central to the story. Not only did season 4’s story quality dramatically decline, but the conditions surrounding it are nothing but despicable. The quality effectively undermines the series’ peak at season 3. I digress. . . .Finally, the music is decent. Jeff Williams writes not only the intro songs, but does the majority of the soundtrack as well. The intro music is actually pretty good generally, with the first two themes being outstanding to me, and a periodic decline in volumes 3 and 4 respectively. The soundtrack itself is fairly good too, as it employs some clever thematic sensibilities to a small but still enjoyable degree. It doesn't shine high above most shows, and the material isn't overall very memorable, but it is a step up in quality from television's average endeavor nonetheless. Casey-Lee Williams, Jeff's daughter (if I'm not mistaken), also provides the vocals for the intros and soundtrack, with a truly beautiful voice and outstanding range. Now for the negatives:The animation, not including the generally well-done choreographic concepts, is fairly poor. I know animation is hard, but television has set higher standards. To be fair, the quality has increased along with the presumable budget increase, but there is still a sense that the characters are simply paper dolls devoid of weight. The quality of choreography in season 4 however declines dramatically, which subtracts one of the show's few redeeming qualities from the dynamic.Despite being arranged with the lore cleverly, the characters are diminished to simplistic, tired clichés. The characters I actually found interesting only sparked interest out of a predisposition liking for that particular kind of character, and at its worst the personalities and the banter between them are insufferably irritating or downright cringe-worthy. This is in no way helped by the voice acting, which generally reaches its peak at flat and minimally passable, but for the most part is just bad. The chemistry between the voice actors is almost absent in its entirety, and that can perhaps be attributed to the generally poor script, which feels choppy and hastily written. The story arc of season 4 however is a sure decline in quality. The plot goes almost-literally nowhere for nearly the entire season (with minimal character development), and there’s an oversaturation of uninteresting exposition alongside new, useless, irritating characters. Individual Volume Ratings: Volume 1: 6/10, Volume 2: 7/10, Volume 3: 8/10, Vol. 4: 4/10, My overall rating: 6/10 (≈ D-) (≈ 3/5 stars)I personally would like some of my time back, though again, there are redeeming aspects here and there that don't make it a complete waste of time. So watch it if it interests you. Don't if it doesn't. If you care about plot or characters though, it’s probably best to steer clear.If the decline in quality continues, I'll change my recommendation from a ""watch if you think you'd like it"" to a ""steer clear"". I can't see myself returning for a fifth volume, so I'll leave the review at it's most positive stage.",5
rwby,"I had low expectations for this, as the animation was low quality, but I gradually began to love it! Everything about this exceeds my expectations. The pacing, grim setting/atmosphere, fight scenes, and plot all add up. The best part is the cut scenes. It really gives you a dark vibe and you understand the plot crystal clear. The characters aren't two dimensional and there solve plot points bit by bit",3
rwby,"I had believed, at first, that this would be a ""failed"" anime. However, after watching the episodes and seeing great reviews, one can clearly see that this anime is nowhere near failure. I hope this anime will be one of the top animes out there since I think people don't appreciate the ""3D"" style art. To me, that art style just makes it much more unique. Also, in my opinion, anime shouldn't be judged by it's art style, but by it's story, and this anime got a heck of a story.",5
rwby,"Definitely not to everyone's taste, this show is kind of all over the place when it comes to what it does well and what it needs to improve upon.What it gets right:Action sequences. This show has some of the coolest fight scenes I've ever seen. They're gorgeous, creative, well-choreographed, and absolutely jaw-droppingly awesome. The weapon and fighting style designs are amazing.Writing: while not always executed as well as I'd like when it comes to the voice acting, the writing behind the story and dialogue is solid. It's witty and funny when it needs to be, brings out the key elements of each character's personality, and for the most part it flows really well. The story's not that original, but that's not necessarily a bad thing since it pulls all of the story elements together better than many of the other series I've seen with similar plot elements. Also, the character pairings for teams is great- their dynamics, strengths, and weaknesses all serve to balance each other and make for really fun and interesting interactions.Character designs: Awesome. Each character that has an actual design is very creative and does a great job conveying the character's personality.Musical Score: Loved it. Bought it.What it needs to improve upon:Animation: Aside from the awesome action sequences, the rest of the animation needs some serious work (though I'd like to note that it does improve with each episode). The characters' movements are all pretty awkward and stiff for the most part. The syncing for the voices is hit-or-miss sometimes (more problems with earlier episodes than later ones), and there are quite a few times when objects and bodies overlap, ruining the sense that the characters and objects are solid. Also, I wasn't a fan of some of the ""cartoon-y"" elements chosen for some scenes, such as characters taking on Chibi appearances or playful fights turning into a 2-d cloud with arms and legs sticking out- it didn't seem to fit the style of the show and was kind of jarring to see. The animation shortcuts were also a bit annoying, such as the show's tendency to reduce background characters into stiff silhouettes. With a few exceptions, the backgrounds needed a lot more work as well.Voice Acting: hit-or-miss sometimes. To the actors' credit many aren't that experienced and are still learning and improving their skills- the acting does improve as the show goes on.As I stated before, this show isn't for everyone. I almost stopped watching it several times in the first few episodes because of the animation and voice acting, but the positive aspects of the show that I listed above made me decide to keep watching despite my hang-ups. I'm glad I kept watching and look forward to seeing the next season and seeing how the show continues to improve.",4
rwby,"I'm glad that Crunchyroll picked up this series. It shows that this series is gaining more and more publicity among the anime community.I really like it how America is starting to develop their own kind of anime culture. I loved anime-influenced American series like Avatar: The Last Airbender, The Legend of Korra, and now RWBY.Also, this my first take on watching a CG anime. I've seen 3D anime, but mostly in video games, but this is the first time I've ever watched a full anime series in CG.Some things I liked about this:First and foremost, it is from Rooster Teeth (how can you not like Red vs Blue?), and it is Monty Oum's work. I also liked how each character has their own unique background and abilities. The plot is still in its early stages, so there are some hokey moments, but I'm giving this series a chance, and I hope to enjoy it all the way through to the end.",4
rwby,"Eschewing most archetypes, and infused with a ""doesn't take itself too serious"" sense of humor, RWBY is a solid offering from Rooster Teeth and Monty Oum. RWBY posses top quality animation, with frenetic battle sequences and developing characters. While episodes are a tad short, each leaves you more interested in the story. I would definitely recommend RWBY to anyone looking for a change from the usual troupes. I am ever impressed with the strength of the female leads; the interesting plot developments; and the well-crafted nature of the universe.",3
rwby,This has been all I could ever ask for. I've heard some really nasty Weeboo rants and unnecessary wrath on the people that like this anime. one I'll say is the animation drawings are the most stellar but the CGI animations are second to none. and the best part if all is the fight scenes are a total death-defying thrill. There's somethings that if I had my way could be improved I really couldn't ask for anything in anime more fun.and actually as I'm watching season 2 they are improving the animations and the drawings a little more every time.,5
rwby,"This review for RWBY is split into what I consider RWBY's important elements: plot, animation quality, soundtrack, and characters. It will be spoiler-free.Plot: RWBY's plot is interesting, but nothing ground-breaking. The first episode opens up with enough mystery and intrigue to keep you watching with a few memorable moments. The majority of the story takes place at Beacon, which is essentially an academy to train chosen adolescents to become warriors, known as Hunters and Huntresses. Why would this universe need Hunters/Huntresses? RWBY's monsters that inhabit the world are called ""Grimm"", whom, in my opinion, become more interesting in later seasons. This leads to some interesting plot points, but there also are a fair amount of ""filler"" episodes. Fights between characters are eye candy to watch, and most have plot relevance as well.Animation Quality: The animation quality improves greatly over the seasons. Season 1 has the roughest animations, specifically when depth-of-field is involved. For example, let's say Ruby is running away from someone from the foreground into the background. The running animation used in season 1 makes it appear as though the character is running on a green screen and can be cringe-worthy at times. By season 3, Rooster Teeth beefed up production enough to deal with unique animation challenges much better.Soundtrack: The soundtrack/music is one of RWBY's strongest qualities. Jeff Williams and Casey Lee Williams write/preform/sing the majority of the songs and they do an amazing job. It's hard to describe the soundtrack in words, so I suggest looking up season 1 and season 2 OSTs on YouTube. As of the time I'm writing this season 3 currently doesn't have a released OST. Needless to say, I'm excited for it.Characters: The characters are likely the largest reason so many people love RWBY. You have a young & somewhat naive Ruby, a tsundere Weiss, an extrovert Yang, and a shy & reserved Blake. Many consider these 4 young girls to be the series' main protagonists. Worry not about a small roster; plenty of other characters are introduced throughout the seasons to keep things interesting as well as... well, I won't hint or spoil anything for you . Saying anything more about each character would diminish RWBY's character development.Verdict: While not the most unique anime out there, the outstanding music and character development alone is worth watching for.",5
rwby,I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by this anime. 3D animes aren't usually my bread and butter nor is video game based animes which use the same animations. I was actually quite fun to sit down for 15 minutes have a drink and watch this short little piece. The animations are standard for you get form a game or an ani-short but it was the story that had me curious and that's I've been enjoying about this. Since there's no manga for this thing to go off of you really don't know where its going to go. Its almost like Binge TV you just don't know how its going to turn out till they get to the conclusion.I was very much saddened to hear about the recent death of RWBY's creator and I hope the series continues to live on.,5
rwby,"TL;DR - This show is better written, far more entertaining than most of the anime that gets released each season in Japan.  There is a reason why RWBY has a large fan base in Japan and there is a reason why Warner Bros Home Entertainment Japan is officially picking this up for official Japanese localization.If you want to give this show a shot, you should NOT go into this expecting a typical anime.  For clarification, RWBY is not an anime.  Anime is... Japanese animation, created by the Japanese industry, for the Japanese audience, where the main spoken language is originally in Japanese and the first broadcast is in Japan.  Now before you go raising your pitchforks at this review, this statement is not to put down RWBY in ANY way, but you are actually doing a disservice to the awesomeness of this show by calling it an anime and expecting it as such.Much like Avatar: The Last Airbender or The Legend of Korra, the show borrows art influences from Japan; but RWBY stands on it's own as a creation from the wonderfully talented people working at Rooster Teeth and of course Monty Oum.Of course it has influences from anime (art/character design obviously), but first and foremost it is an American animated web series.  Upon watching RWBY, very quickly you will pick up on what I mean.  The humor is very American and extremely non-typical of Japanese anime humor.  It is refreshing to see gags and jokes that are not based on main male protagnists walking into the girl's changing room or finding them naked in the shower ending with a slap.  The humor, for the most part, is witty, intelligent and well executed (especially in Volume 2), but enough with the humor.From world building, to character development and growth, to plot development, to fight sequence animation; RWBY manages to do many of the important things right the first time.  Characters are interesting, characters have contrast with each other, interactions are well scripted and RWBY manages to make you care and like each character for their own faults and strengths.The sound editing and music of RWBY is fantastic.  Jeff Williams and his daughter Casey Williams have done a fantastic job with the soundtrack and if anything music is definitely one of the stronger parts of the show.  It fits, it works, and it enhances the show in every possible way.The action is very typical Monty Oum.  If you didn't like Dead Fantasy you won't like this, but I don't know many people that don't enjoy watching over the top, rhythmical, creative and just insanely cool fight sequences.Unfortunately, the show isn't perfect.  The animation is rough at times, clipping of polygons happen here and there and certain backgrounds can lack finer detail or textures.  Keep in mind however that the whole show is made in Poser and Rooster Teeth has been making great strides to improve this and you can see the improvement over Volume 1 to Volume 2.  In addition, the voice acting isn't Hollywood professional.  Certain lines may feel a little forced or even lacking true emotion, but it is good enough for the show.RWBY manages to do so much more with everything ELSE that the minor imperfect surface details are rendered insignificant.  I consume A LOT of anime each season and I've been watching anime since the late 80s.  RWBY is worlds better than a lot of the high production crap that gets put out each season by Japan, especially recently.I am hoping Monty and the Rooster Teeth team continue to pour their hearts and souls into this show and continue to deliver an epic entertaining experience.  Like a book, don't judge it by its cover and you will be pleasantly surprised.""Haters gonna hate and ain'ters gonna ain't.""",5
rwby,"I'm going to come right out and say it: RWBY is not original. In fact, the core of the show seems to be to involve any anime trope they can. And if you are bothered by that then that's fine, it's your opinion and you are allowed to have it.However, that doesn't mean RWBY is bad. In fact, I believe the reason why RWBY is as popular as it is because of it's love and respect for what makes up anime. Unlike some shows that simply use a trope or a cliche because it will appeal to the most people, the creator and writers of RWBY use them simply because they like them and want to show why they do. For example, Ruby is not a cute, dorky girl for the sake of being a cute dorky girl but it's because she has so much less social experience than her peers and is shown to have a stronger affinity for things she knows about like weapons than stuff she doesn't like people. And the writers know this and point it out, like Yang intentionally leaving her so she's forced to meet new people. Likewise, the sharp contrast between Yang's lax and trigger happy side and her maternal, wiser side may seem like a huge contradiction until we learn about her past and see she intentionally holds herself back around Ruby. It's writing like this was why the tropes and cliches became as popular as they did and why RWBY does them well.But this wouldn't be a proper review without talking about the rest of the show. The writing skips in quality at times. Most of the time it's pretty average with the later season giving them a kick to really good. But there are times that the show can push the Rule Of Cool too far and rely on said rule too much. So you're enjoyment there is based on how much tolerance for that you have. If you don't have a lot or even an average amount, you're not going to like the show. However, I should say that I seen far far worse offenders of RWBY's offenses here, one of whom was cited as an inspiration for RWBY. The humor is rather good, especially if you're a fan of wackier humor. it definitely works well in the context of the series. So the writing as  a whole is surprising good.Now time for the animation. Although Volume 1's animation isn't very good, it's acceptable considering the crap I've seen like the numerous still frames and reused animation in a certain Gainax anime. And as the series grows older, the animation gets better as the animators get more and more experienced with the latest Volume's switch to Maya being a great improvement. And the fight scenes are consistently very good, being at the top of fight scenes in anime. (Barring legends like JoJo or DB). Although they do change drastically in Volume 4, they are still a treat to watch. So animation is good.The music is...phenomenal. As in, I play RWBY songs on loop when writing. They are blood pumping when they need to be like ""I Burn"", sad when they need to be like ""Cold"" or uplifting like ""Gold."" Jeff and Casey Williams knocked it out of teh park here. SO the music is spot on and the only thing that doesn't massively improve since it can't improve. The characters, although they fall into basic anime archtypes, have reasons for being the way they are or have variations that make them really interesting, like Jaune's deconstruction of the Idiot Hero. That said, there are a lot of characters in RWBY and most don't get a whole lot of development so that's a point against it. But all in all, the main characters get the development they need and are a joy to watch. SO yeah, the characters are good.The emotion behind the show is perhaps one of RWBY's biggest strengths. There is this sort of energy and feeling behind it, something that tells you that it's not just another generic show pumped out to make a quick buck but rather is a passion project by a man who loved anime and wanted to express that. And that energy and emotion resonates with the audience, enthralling them in the show. So yeah, RWBY's got a great amount of emotion.All in all, RWBY is a good show that has it's fair share of flaws. But, it most definitely makes up for them. If you're a fan of aniem that revel in tehir medium like Soul Eater or anything made by STudio Gainax or Trigger, especially Gurren Lagann or Kill La Kill, you will love this show. And if you aren't then at least give it a fair shot. While it has a very long way to go before becoming great, it's definitely very good.Have a nice day!",3
rwby,"I must honestly say I was skeptical about watching this anime. I normally watch an anime due to graphics since my eyesight. Once I watched episode 1 I greatly fell in love with how the storyline and characters were; it was interesting and epically ecstatic about how the storyline is. It may be a practical anime to some, but its A MUST WATCH. Look on youtube about how this anime became what it is now. Knowing the background about it makes it that much more enjoyable to watch.",5
rwby,"For the season 1-2-3. This show was really good. Animations and story was good, but it was focus on the unique combat action. But the creator died and season 4 is meh, season 5 is just horrible. The story went from nothing special and logic, to magical stuff with bad guys who do bad things for no reasons. + the fights that made the show cool are now horrible to say the least.Plus i really feel like there is product placement for their merc. For exemple : You will see Jaune hoodie, and they make that really akward joke arround it, only one time. Guess what, you can buy the hoodie in their own store for only 39.99$!",5
rwby,"This was Rooster Teeth's first attempt into a animated series. From the mind of Monty Oum, this show with really take you on a ride of emotions from happy, to sad, to down right revenge driven. The first season yes is somewhat slow, but due to the long running nature of this show, it should be at least given a shot as it is mostly used as a way to deliver to the audience the world that was inside the mind of its creator. Each season increases in quality and polish by tenfold in the regard of voice acting, Vic Mignogna as well as Yuri Lowenthal join the cast later in its running, as well as in its animation. If you are a fan of a great series that grows and develops with its audience than please give this show a shot.",5
rwby,"Monty Oum was the lead animator of this show as well as an animator of Roosterteeth's Red vs. Blue. As it has been stated in these comments, no it is not the best animated show on this website, but it was made by hand and computer in a studio office in Austin, Texas. This work contains the love and care that only a true animator can show for his work. Oum passed away on the 1st of January this year, and while this show ""isn't the best"" it is still one of the best anime I've seen, the best American anime I've seen, and the final work by the man that was and is Monty Oum. Even though he passed, he will be remembered for both the impact he had on people, and the works he has created, like this one, that will last forever in this modern tech age. For these reasons and more i can only give a 5 star rating.",5
rwby,"RWBY was envisioned by the American Final Fantasy fanatic and fan-crossover videogame animator-turned-professional Monty Oum. This show shows that Monty is quite the anime enthusiast but at the same time its something much different.The action-loving and highly mobile characters move 60 fps from scene to scene non-stop here. Anime spends 20 minutes with a lot of looping and camera panning, featuring barely moving characters only to show us occasional fight scenes in between 20-minutes of girls just talking. Not to mention the story here is epic without suffering from season-long filler and side stories.The episodes are less than 12 minutes long and the payoffs start early and come often.",4
rwby,"I was down on this series earlier, and I still stand by my opinion of the first 2 seasons (flawed, but enjoyable enough). The third season changed my opinion on it in a huge way, and I'm excited to see where they go next with it. The third season really lives up to the potential that this series has, and finally gives it a sense of purpose (both for the main characters, and the overarching plot). A vast improvement over the previous seasons, and it leaves me anxious for the next season to begin.",4
rwby,"I am very much enjoying this series.I find it unique.I like that the characters are based off characters from stories and history like Jean of Arc is based off Joan of Arc,Ruby based off Little Red Riding Hood,Yang a badass version of Sleeping Beauty,Black Belladonna based off of Bell from Beauty and the Beast,Weiss based off Snow White,Honora based off of a Norse god and etc..I like villains,the monsters,even the style of the animation is nice and unique.The characters even though all diverse and different are so badass!This has literally been Rooster Teath's greatest creation yet.I am normally not a fan of American made cartoons but this one is very awesome,and has become one of my top 5! favorite animated series.And absolutely cannot wait to share this with friends and followers of my blog.I cant wait for Volume 3 do your best Rooster Teeth!",4
rwby,"Rooster Teeth offers a refreshing twist on anime with RWBY. Having watched many of their video game commentaries, I was intrigued when they decided to produce an anime series. So far, it has surpassed my expectations. The English in this series took time to adjust to. Perhaps it was for the better since no subtitles meant that there was nothing obscuring the intense battle sequences. I found the graphics slightly lacking. However, the well choreographed fight sequences more than compensated for this slight flaw. I also immediately liked the characters. The cast covers a wide range of characters from dorky students to crazy professors. Some of John's dorky antics seems forced at times, but I didn't mind too much. Overall solid series and I expect it improve even more as more episodes are released.",5
rwby,"I'm an animator, so this is coming almost strictly from that perspective.RWBY is unique in so many ways, the voice acting although not always perfect, is quirky and for the most part incredibly well done. Each character is unique both in their fighting styles and just the ways that they handle themselves, which is hard to do. even without the actual character models there it would still be possible to pick out the characters just by their movements and that is incredibly impressive.In the U.S. other than Korra, or Adventure Time we lack good, story driven animated shows, which is why so many people gravitate towards anime from japan. This show however shows so much potential as to what is possible. It's made in Austin Texas at Rooster Teeth and still feels like a large budget T.V. show.The first season may of been very rough, and it still has it's moments where they could've put more time into it, but the improvements so far from season 1 to 2 are huge. I can't wait to see where the story goes from here and I hope that this show influences more companies to make good shows like this.I'm just so tired of stupid animated shows that are aimed so largely towards children. Projects like this need our support!",5
rwby,"For an anime with such a low budget, the pool of talent put into this series is impeccable. As a fan of both Anime and Rooster Teeth, I had many doubt for this anime when the trailers first appeared. Packed with action the trailers lacked depth and story, this query was blown out of the water. 'RWBY' is a great anime to watch if you are looking for a quick 5-10 minute fix. Although the story is lacking it makes up for this in character development and obviously its action scenes.I highly recommend this anime to lovers of the action genre.",5
rwby,"RWBY is not for everyone, much like Gurren Lagann isn't for everyone or Fairy Tail isn't for everyone. However, to me RWBY is an astounding series imagined and created by a group who are much, much smaller than the bigger production houses. Some complain about the animation type, others the voice acting. Are they as polished as Black Butler? No, and to be honest it shouldn't be. RWBY shines as it is something original, and you can tell that the VAs, animators and writers really had fun making it. The characters are compelling, the battle sequences astounding, and the character development through the first Season was very well done. I can't wait for Season 2 to premiere this July, as I'm certain the RWBY team will continue to astound us as they refine their craft.",5
rwby,"RWBY (By: Rooster teeth) is truly an example to the entire western industry on how to make an anime good without completely copying Asian country's. RWBY is truly a one of a kind anime that has a great storyline that you quickly get in to, the character designs are cute and amazing, the music is some of the best I've ever heard in an anime (I consider this to be an anime). The only thing that I have a problem with is the voice acting, sometimes it can be quite good and others it's completely crap and sounds out of place.If you can get past that one flaw than this truly is an anime to watch, it shouldn't take you to long to go through it but when you do...You'll be aching for more.",4
rwby,"To be honest, based on some of the trailers I was expecting a little bit better. The style of animation doesn't bother me much but I think the project could be done a lot better. It appears that not much time is spent on character expression for most characters. The design on the weapons is incredible, but aside from that it seems very lackluster. The voice acting, as many others have stated, is atrocious for most characters. There is no emotion and therefore you feel no connection with any of the characters. Also, at least half the time it seems no effort was placed into making the mouth movements sync with the voice. I love the basis on the characters having roots in popular fairy tales, but I can't seem to care about them or their troubles. I blame two aspects for this. The first being as I already stated, the lack of emotion in the voice acting makes me not give a damn. Secondly, the length of the episodes doesn't leave you much time to develop any sort of connection. I also think the music, albeit incredible; plays a bit too loud. It seems to distract from what's actually going in in the show. Overall, I say it has a ton of potential and with the right funding it could become something incredible. I would be a supporter if RoosterTeeth started an IndieGoGo to make the episodes longer (15-20 minutes; 20 minutes would serve as a normal anime length), with more attention to design and sound mixing; as well as getting professional voice actors / getting current staff voice acting classes. A very high level reward could even be a guest character appearance in an episode for maybe, 5-10,000 dollars. Stretch goals could allow for additional seasons. Just throwing it out there.TL;DR: Incredible potential failing to meet epic levels likely due to lack of funding. Exceeds expectations for ""American Anime"" but still quite a bit off the mark. An IndieGoGo campaign could probably fix a great deal of the problems; if not all of them.",3
rwby,"By no means is this series perfect, but I'd argue that it is worth watching. I've seen a fair amount of opinions on RWBY. Many say that it is amazing, and others argue otherwise. While everyone is entitled to their opinions, I may as well shed some light on how I see this. The first criticism I see is of the animation itself. Many fans agree that the first and possibly second seasons have some... dare I say rigid animation. The fight scenes are always a spectacle and seem like a dance between fighters. Beyond that, people are quick to criticize non-combat oriented animation. Despite my enjoyment of the series, even I find it a bit jarring. However, as each new volume is release you can visibly see the improvements the RoosterTeeth team has made. You have to keep in mind that they were pretty new to animation like this at the time of RWBY's release, mainly doing some animated moments for their series, Red vs Blue (set in the Halo games). The experience they have acquired over the years shows throughout the late volumes.Oh and if you don't like the 3D style of animation, stop clinging to 2D animation and get used to it.Another aspect that people criticize is the voices. Maybe it's because these people are biased towards Japanese voice acting and don't like English voices anymore. However, there is some justification for this. Many (if not all) of the voice actors for this show are workers in the RoosterTeeth/AchievementHunter offices and by no means professional. Many enjoy hearing their favorite online entertainers doing these voices, and other's notice the lacking quality. But as I mentioned earlier, they have grown as well... I believe...I have seen a couple of people discussing how they did not like the character design, calling them basic and such. To that I say: look closely to find many inspirations. Team RWBY (the character, not the show name) draws its inspirations from famous fairy tales: Red Riding Hood, Snow White, Beauty and the Beast, and Goldilocks respectively. Some connections are obvious, clearly seeing characters based on Joan of Arc and Sun Wukong (from Journey to the West). Others are a bit harder to see at first glances, like Achilles or Pinocchio. Some characters are not seen much or remain relatively stagnant in terms of growth. Others are given [somewhat] meaningful backstories and development through the plot, taking the hardships from their past and using them to move forward. A character's history, motivation, and intent are also shown in the music. Speaking of...I don't care what anyone says, the music is amazing. Jeff Williams and Casey Lee Williams have done a fantastic job with the music. It's nice how the music revolves around the characters and plot, even with a bit of foreshadowing if you look hard enough. Jeff touches many genres of music at certain times, and Casey is a superb vocalist. I seriously recommend you listen to some of the songs from this series from places like YouTube or your choice of digital music shops (like iTunes).Oh and the story... I don't feel qualified to analyze the quality of the plot. I'm no expert on how a story should be told, but I guess even the most famous heroes in popular stories start with a simpler life. But I enjoy it anyways!Sure the first one or two volumes may be offputting to some. You might disagree with me on many aspects of my opinion. But if you look past many of these things, you can see that it is not as simple as you'd think it to be. The series continues to grow, like the smallest spark invoking a roaring flame. You can't just start a fire and walk away. You need to stick by until the end, much like how you shouldn't dismiss it early to make a judgment.",5
rwby,"This is undoubtedly one of my favorite shows I've watched in a while. The story is enthralling. The characters are well written. The action scenes are absolutely top notch, and have a lot of variety, to put it lightly. And the soundtrack for this series is nothing short of amazing. From high-paced songs that get you excited to see some action to slower more somber songs that may make you cry and a whole lot in between, all of the music is very well written.",3
rwby,"I enjoy RWBY, I'll admit.  I had fun watching all of it so far, but it's not without it's flaws.First season they either ran out of budget or were to lazy to at least draw background characters, second season rectified this.  The animation during fight scenes is pretty good.  Other things, such as when they are running, it looks like they have something shoved up where the sun don't shine.  The voice acting has grown on me, but they also have gotten better as the series progressed.  The first season was pretty rough in this department.First two seasons I don't feel really do much other than build up (*spoiler* one of the bad guys gets arrested, but breaks out later anyways).  Yes, they have awesome fights, and new characters, and someone gets taken down.  But in my opinion, the real stuff takes off season three.Season three is good.  Fight scenes didn't look as good as in season 2 in my opinion, but they were awesome none the less.  The voice acting has gotten better, and the animation is starting to really pick up.  I feel like with this season, RWBY has finally made it's identity. All in all, there are still some rough patches in quite a bit of places, which is why one star was taken off, other than that, RWBY is a solid series, and this season is a solid season.",2
rwby,"(Review as of the end of season 3)Do yourself a favor and watch more than one or two episodes before you dismiss this one.Animation: People often criticize RWBY for it's animation, and while it is rough in places and definitely atypical compared to popular Japanese anime and American animated shows, keep in mind that it's amazing for such a low budget, the rough parts get smoothed out some as the series progresses, and it has it where it counts in things like fight scenes.  The uniqueness of the animation adds flavor to the show and while it may be a bit jarring at first, it grows on you.Story: It starts out a little haphazardly in the first couple of episodes as RWBY tries to introduce you to its world and characters, but it quickly stabilizes.  The story increases in linearity and depth as the series progresses.  The premise of studying at a school to become a warrior may sound a bit familiar, but there are little and big touches all throughout that make it stand out from the crow.  The first season is mostly pretty lighthearted, but don't expect everything to remain happy-go-lucky forever.  Episodes are short originally, but get longer in season two and three.  Despite their short length, however, each episode manages to pack a lot in.Characters: RWBY is all about the characters.  The story is as much about the characters as anything else.  Expect to meet lots of fun, quirky characters, that will alternately make you laugh and give you the feels.Music:  I'm not normally a fan of the kind of style RWBY uses, so I mean it when I say it's pure awesomeness.  Oh, and if you want to get a feel for how things get darker over the course of the series (there are still fun parts; it's just that there are a lot darker moments in season 3 than season 1), look up the lyrics for the opening songs of the seasons.  Country of Origin: Yes, it's made by an American company, but don't let that dissuade you.  Who cares where it was made as long as it has everything you love in it?  What are you waiting for?  Watch it!Overall impression: one of my favorite series",4
rwby,"When RWBY was just a few trailers, I was actually pretty excited for what Monty had in store for Rooster Teeth's fans to watch. And Monty delivered a fantastic anime-inspired show. Spectacular, over-the-top fights and displays of power along with an awesome soundtrack (courtesy of Jeff Williams). As the series went on, the animation even began to distinctly improve.The first season was amazing, though a little iffy on the animation, voices and dialogue. On the animation's problems were due to the guys and gals working on RWBY just getting a feel on the CGI engine (Poser) as well as working on entirely new characters. The voices and dialogue were a little something but notable because the voices for the RWBY girls, for example, are not really professional voice actors at first (Except for Blake's VA, Arryn Zech) and they needed some time to find their spot as those characters. The dialogue was mostly done by two guys (the dynamic duo, Miles and Kerry!) so prior to this, Monty himself gave the two some anime homework. Basically they have to be watching anime so they can get an idea of what kind of things to expect and what to write. All of those needed some work at first when things first started but slowly improve. Season 2 (Or Volume 2) eventually came around and anyone could tell they really improved. The animation wasnt so clunky or choppy. Voice acting has improved (Adding more characters as well), the visuals even improved. But what really stood out was the very first episode just made Vale look a lot more colorful and alive with actual people in the background instead of silhouettes, actual cars driving on the road, and street signs (The traffic lights especially) are now holorgrams reminding us about the Scifi/fantasy world the show takes place in. Even the shading has improved, from a ""Cell shading"" look to a more detailed, gradient kind of shading.Season 3 got slightly better with the visuals and even more so with new characters and adding even more to the story just deepening the plot even further. But it's become hard for me to watch with what Yang was tricked into doing.",4
rwby,"When RWBY first came out it was pretty low budget and you could tell, but as it went along it gained more viewers and more funding, now it looks great.The characters are fun and have some depth to them, you find out more about them as you go so they don't seem static, the story keeps things moving along but also takes some breaks from action to make sure that the characters stay human.It's a show that I check back with every week to see more.",2
rwby,"Okay.  I've watched this show all the way through twice.  The initial watching was ""OH MY GOD CUTE GIRLS WIELDING BIG ****-OFF WEAPONS THIS IS AMAZING OH MY GOD THE FIGHT SCENES.""The second watching was ""Okay what can I find wrong with this show.""The show itself is a great watch.  The characters are fun and vibrant, the world feels good and while season one was a bit sluggish in the end, season two picked it up and kicked it into high gear!Now, I've only got one REALLY particular gripe with this show, and it's the animation in some points.  (Watch the episode Dance Dance Infiltration, where Cinder is running on the rooftop and you'll see exactly what I mean.)  But that aside, that's the only REAL complaint I have.  Season one was in itself, the pilot all the way through.  It was a new idea, seeing what would stick as it tossed concepts and ideas at the wall and season two took what worked and ran with it in a really satisfying way.All in all:  Four out of five.  I'd give it a five out of five but seriously, go watch Dance Dance Infiltration.  Like now.  Go watch it now.  I'm complaining about it but I'm also advocating that it be watched so it's like a fifty-fifty deal.But seriously, set aside an afternoon, grab your favorite drink and snack and watch this show.  It's fun, it's explosive and leaves you with a satisfied sensation at the end.",5
rwby,"If RWBY is anything, it is a good time and fun to watch. The action sequences are fun and interesting and the story does have progressions and arcs I'm curious to see told. The characters are fun and while the voice acting is not always great; I appreciate this for the fun ride it was and the the nice package it adds up to being at the end. Support RWBY because I have a feeling it is going to keep getting better and better over time.",5
rwby,"RWBY being the product of Rooster Teeth has been kind of a love hate relationship for me. On one hand you have a team that brought you action comedy thriller like Red vs Blue. A comical slash dire masterpiece of fringe style comedy action story with a deep dark subplot. RWBY shares much of the deep dark world beneath the world type writing, and the world Team RWBY knows really is just a sugar coated topping.But I had to grit through some just off and rudimentary animations. I was happy and forgiving when I found out they were working on solving that. I do applaud what they poured into these short episodes. Its often more than what some animes put in twenty five minutes to an hour. More RWBY less filler...Some of the characters get annoying but it doesn't detract from the fact that they continue to develop and won't remain the same characters later on in times to come.I'm givin it back to RWBY cause they are cleaning up good and making strange story more strange.And Hters don't like it, change the Crunchy station. More Lolli less RWBY",5
rwby,"I have faithfully followed this series since Rooster teeth announced that it was going to be a thing. I have always enjoyed the things they create, and this is no exception.After the first season I didn't feel I had enough to go on, so I decided to wait to review it. I'm glad I did. Putting the animation, and art aside I felt that after the first season we didn't have much story progression. However this season the Rooster teeth team has done an excellent job in fleshing out the characters back story, and giving the show a more serious tone. I'm eager to see how the show progresses.The animation as well has improved compared to the first season when we had black silhouettes for background characters. I'm glad they are putting in a bit more detail, and working on keeping the episode length above twelve minutes. To those people out there who won't watch it due to the animation, or because it is made in America I urge you to give it a chance. Sometimes it's nice to try something a little different.",5
rwby,its so unique. and lets be honest its probably the best looking cgi youve ever seen.the characters could use some more and the episodes need to be longer and please please rooster teeth make this series as long a red vrs blue. its more popular any ways. and apeals to a wider audience....not just xbox fan boys like yourselfs. im just hoping for more this is one of the few anime im watching this season. along with zangouku no terror and barakamon,4
rwby,"At first, I didn't like the animation but it grew on me; the characters seemed to be sub par. However, I kept watching because of the fight scenes and funny one liners. It's also refreshing how short the episodes are. The first season opening song is too good as well. As this series progresses, you can tell that RT is growing as well our beloved MCs. It's 4am, sorry for the scattered review, give it a shot and I don't think you will be disappointed.",5
rwby,RWBY Volume 2 is an improvement over the first in every way. No more four minute episodes has allowed for much better pacing then last volumes at times brutal slog. Also the animation has received a marked improvement with much better backgrounds and smoother character animations. Top that off with a group of much actually menacing villains and much more screen time focused on the main team and volume 2 has everything the 1 volume lacked while still retaining what it did right (Excellant music and action.),4
rwby,"RWBY is one of those examples of how a show can do a lot of small things right in order to make it great. It doesn't have the largest budget, but the art style is unique, quirky, and memorable. Small details like how blood fluttering petals add a nice flare to already dramatic and intense action scenes. The quirky humour and witty banter between the characters in the side scenarios are what made this a favourite for me; the humour quickly grew on me and because of it RWBY is on the top of my all time favourite animes.",4
rwby,"Hmm, a review of the web series RWBY. I know this show isn't an anime but it certainly feels like one and that's why I decided to write a review for it (plus the fact that there isn't much to write about this weekend). RWBY is a series by Rooster Teeth; a small production studio based in Texas who do a lot of different video shorts. RWBY is the first and might be the only series I'll watch from them not to say that their bad or anything but the other work they have created doesn't exactly fit my taste. Anyway, onto the review:StoryRWBY takes place in the world of Remnant where a legendary battle of light vs darkness rages on with humanity representing the light and soulless beast called the ""Creatures of Grimm"" representing the darkness. Humans power various weapons and magical powers with a mysterious element called ""Dust"", which gives them the upperhand and eventually leads them to victory. Those who specialize in using such powers are called ""Huntsmen"" and ""Huntresses"" and those who wish to take up such an occupation in the future attend special schools like Beacon Academy. Ruby, Weiss, Blake and Yang are four such girls who form a team in hopes of becoming Huntresses in the near future. Hmm, this setting is nothing new; a battle between good and evil, four girls with very different and conflicting personalities form a team, they all go to a special school (school uniforms included) where they hone their skills while becoming closer to one another. Nothing new but it's still pretty damn good the way it has been carried out. If anything Volume 1 is really all about laying down the foundation for the whole series and introducing the characters and the world they live in. The Creatures of Grimm do seem to take a back seat to everything that goes on in this series and that's the only part of the plot that seems to bother me a tiny bit.The premise and synopsis makes it seem like they're an incredibly important piece to the overall story but really the Creatures of Grimm are only given screen time when you venture into their territory like a hunter walking into the woods and encountering a grizzly bear. As long as you stay out of the woods, they're almost non-existent. Besides that one point, everything else in RWBY is incredibly good. What I find most interesting is the situation involving the Faunas or more importantly the White Fang which also forms the great relationship between Weiss and Blake. The Faunas are pretty much humans except they have some kind of animal like characteristic (typically ears) and that has brought about various acts of discrimination and racism. Not to mention the fact that Faunas are typically used as slave labor by the most prominent Dust producing company in the series; Schnee Dust Company. The Faunas attempt to fight for independence and equality and while some do so peacefully, more radical groups like the White Fang resort to terrorism. This only creates a greater divide between humans and Faunas but creates an interesting sub-plot that I really want to know more about. There are other subplots in this series that seem to be converging into one greater event such as Penny's odd origin (I think she's an android; calling it now), Roman's alliance with the White Fang which is strange since the White Fang practically despise humans, Roman's superior and her accomplices. Rooster Teeth really managed to lay down a great first volume while dragging in it's viewers and getting them to beg for a second.AnimationI think it goes without saying, CGI isn't something that can be given an accurate rating number. It's either good, bad or bearable and RWBY's animation is kind of in-between bearable and good. The action sequences are certainly amazing, more thought out and intricate than ANY anime I've ever watched. RWBY is the only series I've come across where I would actually want to go back multiple times and rewatch a scene again and again. Sometimes small explosions can get in the way of a fight scene but this usually happens during quick paced fights. The character designs are actually second the best part of RWBY's animation or more so of Monty Oum's creativity.Each of the characters in RWBY share some kind of resemblance or allusion to a famous fairy tail character or some historic figure. Alright screw the character designs, what I really wanted to talk about are the weapon designs. The majority of weapons in RWBY are hybrid combinations of projectile and melee weapons that are each beautifully constructed. I can't help but love each of the weapons incorporated into this series. My favorite being Blake's Gambol Shroud.Music & SoundThe voice actors for RWBY aren't half bad and it only takes the first time hearing them to get used to their voices. There are moments when the voice acting doesn't seem to sync up with the animation. The dialogue however isn't as aggravating or annoying as Japanese anime or their English dubs where we tend to have strange pauses, cutoffs or the usual ""repeat something someone just told you because it's dramatic"" thing. I guess in the industry of voice acting, most of RWBY's voice actors are actually amateurs but the scriptwriters made up for it.RWBY's soundtrack is definitely something you should hear. Even if you weren't a big fan of the series, you will most likely love the soundtrack which was mostly sung by Jeff Williams and his daughter Casey Lee Williams. Primarily hard rock with a little bit of electronic, RWBY's OST is out of this world. Admittedly, Casey does speak with a lisp so some words are slurred during a song but nonetheless, it's still an amazing soundtrack. Each of the main heroine's trailer songs were actually slight spoilers to their background and personalities which has only become noticeable after the ending of the first volume.CharactersRWBY's cast are a diverse set of characters and are very relatable (I know it's not a word, yet.), at least personality wise. I don't think anyone these days have actually gone to school to be trained in the art of killing monsters. As I stated before the dialogue and basic conversation between characters is smooth and sounds about as natural as would an average conversation with your friends. Just like I stated before, the issue between the Schnee Dust Company and the White Fang creates a significant change in the character development between Weiss Schnee and Blake Belladonna that I won't spoil for you. The other two members of Team RWBY include the blood sisters (yes, their blood related) Ruby and Yang who share good chemistry as to be expected. Despite their difference in personality, over the course of the 16 episode short series, the girls learn to set aside their differences for the sake of the team. It's a cliche that's been done a couple hundred times but RWBY transitions through it all making it unique as well. The other cast members include two other teams from Beacon Academy; Team JNPR and Team CRDL who each contain their own motif as well. As Team RWBY is to fairy tail characters, Team JNPR is to ancient warriors and Team CRDL is to birds.OverallRWBY is definitely a short series that will keep you interested. What RWBY has done is nothing new but it definitely stands out with great fight scenes, an interesting story and a great set of characters to enjoy. Remember that Vol.1 was simply laying the groundwork and building the Team mechanics for the characters. We have yet to really get into the deeper plot and this will most likely be the focal point in the next volume. Technically there hasn't been an official air date for Vol.2 but expect news on that sometime soon.",5
rwby,"The four trailers kinda set my expectations pretty high for this and honestly, I was left wanting more. I was expecting something like a watchable video game with this, because the trailers were over the top and crazy with insane choreography, unrealistic but really cool looking weapons and amazing animation all with an awesome ost. But when it started running, the plot dragged on for way to long with stuff I didn't really care about, the first episode sets up what could be amazing if they stuck what they were good at. The plot isn't bad, it had a lot of potential but it focused on the wrong stuff. I didn't care about the school or the students or anything like that. I wanted to hear more about the criminal underground and the monsters that inhabit the world. We didn't see anything like that until around episode 13 or 14. That's when it gets real and really good. not saying the other episodes are bad, they had a few cool fights but there wasn't enough to keep it as memorable as the last few episodes. The soundtrack was great though, Jeff Williams really wrote some excellent pieces for the series. I not just saying there good, i'm saying they're amazing. The ost is also diverse too being able to go from orchestral pieces to club mixes, it's fantastic. The animation style was very refreshing too. It's done in a cel-shaded 3-d style similar to video games like Borderlands and Telltale's The Walking Dead, but it sames like the budget was saved for just the action scenes as the animation outside of them is average at best. Just look at the now infamous cookie eating scene. The voice acting was actually decent but the lip syncing is pretty shotty. I was actually afraid of what might happen with the voice acting because in the trailers, it was horrible. Overall, it has potential but let's hope that the producers really pull up there game for volume 2. I'm really looking forward to it.",5
rwby,"To be honest, it is hard to know what to expect with this series seeing as how its the first of its kind.  An anime inspired western web series by a studio that rose to fame by basically playing video games.  But personally I found that this series kicked the arse out of 90% of the anime I've seen coming out of Japan.The story and characters are a refreshing change of pace from the norm, most breaking out of any  stereotype mold as the volume plays out.  The writers use there time very efficiently, displaying some plot and character developments very subtly, leading to some some big ""ah-ha"" moments down the road.  It was also nice to see so many female leads that can actually be taken seriously.  Only one or two could even be considered fanservicy at times, but it never comes close to taken over their characters.Oh, and the music is freaking amazing!  There are no words I can type that will do it justice.  The soundtrack wasn't #1 on iTunes for no reason.If there is one flaw it is the episode length.  Some of them are as short as 4 minutes, meaning that by the time you start to get immersed, the end credits roll.  But if you are marathoning it, its amazing.",5
rwby,"Pros:Badass weaponry.Badass Characters. Also, characters are lovable.Badass soundtrack.Unique sense of delivering the show.Cons:Somewhat noticeable goofs.Voice acting may be bad but that grows onto you.Episodes are short.Amazing show. Gives a the term ""Amerianime"" a new meaning. There's badass characters, badass weaponry, and a unique style of animation. Although the voice tends to be ""bad"", that'll grow on you as that voice begins to mold into that character, making it dumb to change voice actors. The animation maybe bad but that's due to the a small crew working on this, so episodes tend to be short or noticeable goofs appear throughout the show but, then again, it's a small team producing these episode making them more badass for making a more badass show.",4
rwby,"Have faith in Roosterteeth, have faith in Monty Oum, have faith in the RWBY team.They've got something going here, something that can last a long time. If RWBY can last as long as Red vs Blue has lasted so far, it'll be something worth sticking with.As for its start, while it has the occasional animation issue or clipping problem, its got great music, great fight scenes, and your typical Roosterteeth sense of humor, minus the curse words.I'm all for this show. Definitely suggest giving it a shot.",5
rwby,"RWBY is a bit disappointing.  It has so much potential but it's flaws, few as they are, are just to prominent.Story: 4/5 - Okay I'll admit I'm being bias but I just can't help but love a story about a strong woman who's weapon of choice is a scythe.  That aside, the story feels cliched but cliche sells.Animation: 2/5 - I just can't get over how good the action scenes look compared to the rest of the show.  It just feels lazy.  Voice Acting: 1/5 - I've heard much better voice acting in art school class projects.Soundtrack: 4/5 - The soundtrack works so well with the series.",5
rwby,"RWBY is a spectacular internet-made show created by Monty Oum. Produced by RoosterTeeth.com, this show carries many different actions, under the same subject. This show follows Ruby Rose a quirky, and a somewhat childish girl who is granted into Beacon Academy after she battles the evil Roman Torchwick. Roman escapes but Ruby is taken to meet Prf. Ozpin and is accepted into Beacon. Her fighting skills are greater in strength because she lacks a 'fear of death'. Ruby's weapon of choice is her High Caliber Snippier Scythe, know as the 'Crescent Rose'.Weiss Schnee is what most people would call bossy, bratty, and ambitious; yet, in episode 8 we see a kind and helpful side of her. She is smart and strong, using Dust in battle to take things to her advantage. Not much is know about her backstory and we hope to see later on how she got her arrogant personality. Weiss' weapon of choice is the 'Myrtenaster', a Multi Action Dust Rapier. She has a long scar along her left eye.Blake Belladonna is more distant and quite than the other characters but she has a fierce fighting style. Seen in the Black Trailer, she has deeper morals and cares for other human's lives, even if they have wrong doings; this makes me think if she had been granted mercy if she was face with death long ago. Blake shows many cat-like features, including her amber eyes and her bow. She also has great agility and flexibility. Blake's weapon of choice is her Variant Ballistic Chain Scythe, dubbed the 'Gambol Shroud'Yang Xiao Long is the last person on team RWBY. Yang has a very 'fiery' personality (X3) and is seen as the big sister of the group. It as been see before that you do not mess with Yang's hair in battle, she treasures that stuff! o///o' In battle or if she become enraged her lilac eyes turn to a deep red and her hair appears to give off fire. But in times of need, her great strength and skill are valued. Yang's weapon of choice is her Dual Ranged Shot Gauntlets, 'Ember Celica'This great anime brings four very unlikely characters together as they face the challenges and monsters to become Huntresses and help their world.I hope this gives you a little info about the show and it's main characters. This show does have it's flaw here and there with either animation of voice acting, but it still is a great story for when you have nothing to d Learn more by watching the show on CrunchyRoll or Roosterteeth.com-Tie~",5
rwby,"I will say this now. Making a good action anime is hard, it's difficult to balance the various elements of plot and motives with the actual fighting itself, and how much of it there is. Animation: Shoddy character expressions (during fights, I look at faces. Also when people eat, drink, and speak), Nice fights (well thought out), Good Character Design Concept (nice weapons!), Why do all the enemies look horribly bad in detail compared to the MC's?? Spend some time on them!!Sound Mixing: Borderline terrible, I won't lie on that fact or try to call it better than it is. It's bad when you see a mouth moving but it doesn't quite try to sync with the words, or when something makes a sound, it doesn't quite ""sound"" like it is supposed to. The music is played louder to remain the focal point for the audio to overlook the mixing problems.Vocal Talent: Amateur Class 101. Add emotion to your voice, it's as simple as that. Everything else just follows through when emotion is added.Music: No complaints, I can see myself buying a copy of the soundtrack. It's pretty cool.Characters: I feel sort of ""meh..."" towards them, hard to describe. Just, it feels very plain when you see them interact on daily things but they're hype when fighting. It's kind of a weird mix, blame the story for that.Story: Light and Darkness is a thing I loathe hearing about, when someone talks about Light and Darkness as a plot theme, I think of how many childish stories follow this path. Originality Matters. Anything else? No, I don't quite see how starting an anime with no backstory and simply reused plot ideas are a good idea for a storyline.Overall: despite my criticism, I don't hate this anime. I can't. The fact is: How much ""epic"" can you fit into a couple of minutes without constantly trying to appeal to fans? It's difficult. However Amateur stuff has it's perks, and in time, seeds grow into something incredible. Hopefully this anime will become something I can talk about with friends, not because it's made by Rooster Teeth (American Anime w00t!! I <3 RvB!!), but because it became something worth bragging about having seen.",3
rwby,"Monty Oum (Creator) is known for his action packed CG work and this is no exception. Note this series is a WEB series meaning episodes are supposed to be short. Each episode is split in half to keep content rolling. Even I know this, but I'm still bugged by it nonetheless it's a good series so far (Wished each episode was atleast 8-10min). RoosterTeeth has many other series to work with also so don't complain too much (Red v Blue!). Perks about the series:+ Bad Ass Characters+ Bad Ass Weaponry+ Bad Ass Fight Scene+ Each episode seems to improve from the past due to feedback.+ Voice Acting improved greatly from the trailersNegatives- Voice performance -  CG (Animation) mistakes - Irregular episode cut offs leading to Ruby Syndrome ( Cravings for more episodes and bolstering complaints about episode length nonetheless rewatches episodes millions of time due to withdrawal).This review will update when further content is added to the show ^_^",4

Honestly, a lot of people complained about the 180 from super happy positive almost ""Magical Girls"" young adults show, to a darker mood - but for the overall story line of the world it makes sense  Season 3 had a lot of amazing fight scenes and introduced a lot of teams  Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hide You'll never see again . Motion and animation had improved drastically for normal character interaction. Not as many cringey lines made it in here.Season 4... 4 stars. A complete overhaul to the animation for the show, more awesome fight scenes and getting a bit of story fleshed out now. It's starting to get to the main course of the world and whats happening. Character interactions are still shaky but much better from season 1-2. There was definitely some good character development during this season.Season 5 - 1 star.I honestly am not going to sit here and go through every issue I had with season 5 but it was a complete let down in my opinion. I feel like the team really stepped away from what they were best at - and it did NOT work out for them. Here's hoping next season will be better.I still love it, and I love the world and will continue to watch it - but just the trend they had set getting better was completely ruined with the last season.",4
rwby,"Apologies for the length, but I wanted to be thorough in covering many aspects of the series.  I hope you bear with me.Synopsis:RWBY is a series about the world of Remnant, where people across several different nations live together in peace while keeping monsters known as Grimm at bay.  The story follows primarily an academic team of four girls training to become the protectors of innocent people, known as ""huntresses"", who train at a combat academy to fight these creatures of Grimm using weapons powered by their ""aura"", a magical force from within the user that protects and empowers them, and ""dust"", an external resource imbued in ammunition, clothes, and other applications for various effects.  These four huntresses, together, become Team RWBY, and they get into various sorts of trouble over the course of their time at school, Beacon Academy, while seeking solutions to troubling discoveries they make along the way.Details & Feel:The characters in the story are inspired from (and, in some cases, bear similarities with) characters in fairy tales, history, and folk stories from various cultures.  Perhaps most obviously, the fairy tales of Grimm are overtly represented amongst the members of Team RWBY.  The world itself has a deep and nuanced history and sociological reality that may be alluded to through the various interactions between characters and groups.  Many social patterns bear close similarity to American culture, which contrasts with the Eastern-stylistics of the character models and action sequences.If I were to make comparison of this series to others I have watched in the past, I would say that this show has several parallels to Soul Eater in the narratives, the general worlds, the action, and other tropes.  If you enjoyed that story, anime or manga, this one should feel similar in many ways.  The characters themselves are not so caricatured as those of Soul Eater, bearing more realistic motivations and personalities that help inform the tone of the series as being more mature and more down-to-earth in its themes.The story at its current state has reflected themes of loss, hope, love, friendship, calamity, abuse, coping, control, social justice, destiny, and fear/negativity.  Fear and other such negative emotions are a major driving force in the world of RWBY as madness is in Soul Eater, which creates a great deal of tension and impact within the story at critical points.  Especially considering parallels to the real world, whether at the personal scale or the global scale, there is a lot that viewers may find relatable in the narrative of RWBY.  It has been my observation as part of the fan community that RWBY has even managed to inspire viewers who were at an emotional low point in their lives.The dynamic of the show in terms of time is not typical, being that it is a web-series not designed for TV broadcast, but rather the average internet surfer.  The episodes vary in length during earlier volumes, but most do not reach anywhere close to the 30-minute-time-slot lengths that most anime on Crunchyroll has.  However, they are also not ever less than 4 minutes like how many TV spot anime episodes on Crunchyroll are partitioned.  They may tend to vary between 8 - 15 minutes each.  As a result, a volume will not be as long of a marathon as it may seem, but each episode will certainly not waste time.  Some plot progression may seem slow, or take more episodes than seems necessary, but that will be because some plot lines are carried through several episodes in tiny chunks that are equivalent to a whole 20-minute anime episode. The music composed for the show is most often vocalized and spans several genres, though the most prevalent ones are rock, jazz, and orchestral.  Vocals are generally performed by the voice of Casey Lee Williams, the daughter of the series' composer, Jeff Williams, though male vocal segments are present in several songs as well.  These songs serve as leitmotifs for the characters and their lyrics also allude to some aspect of the character associated with them, serving as another dimension to the lore of the series.  Knowing the lyrics of these songs can reinforce a viewer's understanding of the series as a result, or even alert them of what has yet to happen.Context:RWBY was not merely the brain child of the folks responsible for bringing one of the most successful machinima franchises in history, Red Vs. Blue, through the medium of Halo: Combat Evolved by Bungie, Rooster Teeth.  This is show is based upon the original work of Monty Oum, an animator who died in 2015 after the composition of Volume 3, but before its release.  Monty Oum was known for fan animations such as Haloid and Dead Fantasy prior to his work on the animated segments of Red Vs. Blue in later seasons.Monty's death was a blow that reached personal spheres within Rooster Teeth's working staff for the show.  For Volume 3 and onward, there is a profoundness of emotional content that will surpass even lenient impressions to be held of the first two volumes.  I would assert that much of this work is the result of a shared experience of the entire staff; it is a phenomenon that I struggle to find a comparable case in any industry for.  Monty's very soul continues to inform the narrative quality of this series.With this in mind, it is to be re-emphasized that, as a chilling coincidence, RWBY was set up to be a story with deep and profound themes of loss, coping, and hope.  Starting from Volume 3, the staff have been more prepared than ever to deliver a story that reflects genuine and organic feelings and circumstances aligned to these themes.  I consider this an assurance of quality in future work within the series, but take it as you will.Production Quality and Mitigating Factors:Something worthy of note is that a lot of internal talent for voice acting work, and the production team for the series gradually expanded, especially at the time during Volume 3's development.That said, the first two volumes have their issues as the earliest forms of the studio's work that may require endurance from a critical viewer.  Animation and detail will be profoundly lower due to the production staff breaking into new territory, and the dialogue will start out awkward early on due to the nature of central characters.  This all changes for the better later on as the production team learned from mistakes and improved upon shortcomings.  Some examples of this were the jarring juxtapositions of certain 2-dimensional effects with the 3D animation, ""shadow people"", bland environs, and rigid non-combat gestures.The first two volumes, however, are very important to the story as character-establishing/developing, world-building, and foreshadowing.  In fact, there are instances where that very same awkward dialogue uttered by characters has meaning that extends beyond anything you see until Volumes 3 and 4, making them valuable details despite their presentation.  The first two volumes are therefore worth your time to engage with first to experience the story the way it was intended.Volume 3 was the last one in which the particular modeling software used for the characters since the first episode, Poser, was employed.  At that point, the animation had already evolved in quality in many aspects.  Beginning in Volume 4, the production team began using Maya, which enables a degree of freedom in character animation that was as yet unseen in the series.  Without going into too much detail, the expressiveness of Faunus, a race of people with animal ears and tails, could be more nuanced and detailed than in the past.  Additionally, the facial expressions appeared a little less ""broken"" on the faces of the characters while not sacrificing anything with regards to more energetic scenes of battle.  This all builds into an ever more immersive storytelling experience, as a viewer will feel less like they are looking at Miku Miku Dance scenes (as one might mistake as the software used to make the first few volumes) as they are looking at an actual anime.Other Media:This series has an accompanying series called RWBY Chibi.  It is animated in a chibi style using Maya, and bears a simplistic aesthetic due to its nature as an in-between series for the Rooster Teeth production team, having been made after Volume 3 and before Volume 4.  Even so, the dynamic movement of the models in this series goes well beyond the previous Poser models, which is especially important for the impact of its slapstick routines.  If I were to describe the style in terms of proportions, it would be somewhat like if RWBY took place in The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker and everyone was about Link's size; the show is not cel-shaded.  It is advised that you do not watch that series without finishing Volume 3, as it alludes to spoilers as far as the Volume 3 finale.Current State & Summary:The story itself has only recently completed its fourth volume, and it does not seem to have a quick path to an end in sight.  Many plot lines have split off and begun converging, yet there are layers of conflict that run deeper than what the protagonists are currently aware of.I have awarded this series 5/5 stars.  While there are certainly quality faults in the first two volumes, those faults only go so far in obscuring the quality story being told.  Improvements as the series went on also begin to overshadow earlier points such that your endurance through the awkward beginnings will be richly rewarded.  The particular score deduction that the faults would account for do not amount to enough to justify a 4-star rating as a result.  If I were to use the 5-point scale with decimals, it would be around 4.7 or 4.8 out of 5.If you are new to the series, I hope you consider watching it through at least Volume 3 before you finalize your own judgment.  Should you find that you enjoy it, a passionate community exists for the series as well.Recommendations from a fan to other fans:Every time I have been watching recent episodes, I would then pay a visit to the Youtube channels of MurderofBirds and Puns of Damage to witness their reactions.  They are among several major community figures for RWBY that accentuate the impact of each episode.  MurderofBirds tends to anticipate developments in the story based on current knowledge, while Puns of Damage would provide a heartfelt analysis of social and emotional content within each episode.  Both of these commentators have a deeply emotional and personal connection to the series that will even show in tears, so those who do not feel comfortable with watching real emotional outbursts on the internet may not prefer them, but I consider their commentary to have critically added to my own interpretation of the episodes as I was watching them.  I would recommend giving them a watch sometime.",2
rwby,"THIS REVIEW IS UPDATED FOR; RWBY SEASON 4 EPISODE 12 Damn, Rooster Teeth... Just...  Damn... I never thought you'd do it, but...YOU FINALLY MADE RWBY INTO A FANTASTIC, MUST-WATCH SHOW!While the first three seasons were pretty fun to watch and had surprisingly good story, characters, animation and action, its Season 4 which really shows what RWBY should have been all along.The main problem with the first three seasons is that it was clear through the analysis of the writing that the creators didn't really know what direction to take RWBY in. Up until Season 3 Episode 6, the past episodes were practically fillers that had no general meaning or caused much advancement in the plot. This was incredibly disappointing when considering all the effort and the set-up they had for this world; with villains, dust, aura, and ESPECIALLY the Grimm. It was such as shame that they didn't use this potential!But Season 4 is where they TRULY kick it off!I'd even say that the first three seasons of RWBY to season 4 is like the first three Star Wars episodes to Episode IV; the first two were blegh, the third one was pretty good yet still had its problems, yet IV is practically a masterpiece!Finally this show takes advantage of the universe its made for itself by focusing more on the Grimm, creating an actual villain, and making the show a whole lot more darker and edgy! Now I can say with complete confidence that this is a must-watch web series for everyone!NO VERDICT SINCE THE SHOW ISN'T DONE YET",4
rwby,"The beginning of RWBY is what will turn most people away from this series, as the series started as a web series by Roosterteeth. Season 1 is cut into six minute shorts with an obviously low budget, secondary character designs are  nonexistant. This does not mean, however, that the series stays that way. Quite the opposite, with each passing season the production value and storytelling ability evolve. Six minute shorts evolve into 15-20 minute episodes and the animation becomes more detailed and unique. Background art and character models have been boosted in quality so much Episode 1 of the series is nothing in comparison to the more recent episodes. As of this review Season 4 is taking the series to new heights artistically, and I only expect more from this franchise. As for the show itself...I honestly was shocked of how much I enjoyed the series. I came in with low expectation after seeing some comments on YouTube, watching only out of sheer boredom. I quickly became interested and the next thing I know I binged the current episodes in little more than 3 days. Likable characters and insane acrobatic fighting scenes blend well with a unique world loosely based on fairy tales from all over the world. Roosterteeth and the late Monty Oam have blended eastern and western culture in a way that only Avatar: The Last Airbender was able to do (with a much smaller budget). The lore and story so far have been almost entirely well connected and engaging while still allowing for some mystery and a desire to see more. Overall the story is without a doubt the best part of RWBY. That being said I have complaints. Thanks to the initially short story telling the show takes a while to get on it's feet, and even in the current seasons each episode can barely allow the plot to move forward, especially with the current arc being quite a bit larger. The first two seasons move slowly, behaving more like a schoolgirl anime than an action fantasy like it wants to be. This, however, is quickly resolved as season 3 smacks you with so many plot changes the series becomes almost unrecognizable. The show jumps from lighthearted humor to grim events so suddenly at times it can leave you in a moment of awe as you suddenly take in what happened. The show also suffers still from a lower than usual budget, and requires brief 3 minute fillers between some episodes, which adds to the story a bit but often remove you from the immersion. And while the story can be at times too much for the episode time to handle the overall plot in more than satisfactory to see. Overall I would give this show a 4/5. There is a lot of potential in RWBY, and it's almost perfect. It is, however, held back by a lower budget and the limits that come with it. But if the recent seasons are any indications they are getting far more money each year and with it more resources to expand. Keep with this series, you won't be disappointed.",5
rwby,"I have loved this show ever since I first found it. It is fun and goofy, while managing to keep the serious aspects of the show serious. It is very good at hinting at the ominous future while keeping the characters developing in their own ways. The characters are very intriguing and yeah they might seem like your boring cliche characters, but I believe they are definitely developing them off that as it progresses especially with what just happened at the conclusion of the most recent volume. I would recommend this 100%. However you need to come into this with an open mind despite the animation and the ""shallow characters"". Keep in mind the characters do develop.",4
rwby,"This is the kind of series that makes its lemons into really, really good lemonade.  The budget is pretty low at the beginning and so at first the animation isn't exactly Bones class material (that gets loads better every season), but boy do they use what they do have to its best capacity.  Despite its technical shortcomings, they do so many things right that even many beautifully polished anime don't manage to do.First the animation: It's mostly Poser Pro and it does look odd, kind of like slightly older video game scenes (that's what I kept thinking, anyway) but the beautiful designs, style and and world building among other things more than made up for that, especially as they kept improving as the series progressed.  The rapid-fire action and choreography for the fight scenes is pure genius (RIP Monty Oum, you were truly amazing) and the incredible music (it's all sooo good) just made it all the better.  Every weapon or ""semblance"" power is surprising and fun to watch (almost no weapon had just one function and the ridiculousness of some of them only made me love it more--the main character has a folding gun-scythe and super speed powers for crying out loud, and even coffee cups are to be feared).The most amazing part of this is the world building and characters though.  They all feel genuinely human, even a lot of the side characters.  That's true for a lot of good shows, but I think this one does it especially well.  There are believable motivations, complex emotions and most of all you can really feel for them, care about them, and laugh or cry with them.  A lot of girls in anime kind of annoy me but I love every one of these characters.  It's interesting too that most of them are loosely based on historical or fairy tale characters and that plays into their stories in an interesting way.  And the world of Remnant!  It takes place in a fascinating world where the moon is half crumbled, Dust crystals grant powers, mysterious monsters called Grimm prey on humans, animal-humans called Faunice fight for their rights or for domination, and hunters and huntresses are taught to protect mankind.  It's complex and mysterious, and really cool.Soo this is got long.  But RWBY is that good.  In short, just watch it, you'll see what I mean.  You'll laugh a lot and cry too and season 4 better come soon.",5
rwby,"Okay, so, let me start this by saying that RWBY has made me into such a devoted fan it's ridiculous. I watched the first episode before I watched the trailers, first fight seen was great, mysterious, and I wanted to know more. Then the characters actually started talking to each other... insert cringe here. Yeah so the writing and and voice acting was AWFUL. God, such, cringe. But I thought the fight scenes were really interesting, and so I watched. I got to the end of the season, it was good, not great, but good enough for me to watch the next season. The next season was better, even if it had a bit less plot development. The animation got smoother, and writing got slightly better, and the show starting feeling a bit better in its own skin. Still some cringe, but less. Not much to say except that Monty Oum died. He was a genius, season 3 commenced. Wow. Like, wow. Fight scenes got more original, more glorious, and the plot! Wow, the writing felt not just good, but fantastic. I watched the show eagerly, I watched reactions, I watched reviews, that's how good season 3 is. I cannot wait for season 4, the show is so much more complex than I ever would have thought from just watching the first episode. Also, you should watch the trailers, they're amazing. Fantastic show, fantastic animation, I've cried watching more than once, just, great.PS Don't watch it on Crunchy Roll if you don't have premium. The episodes are too short for all those ads, watch it on youtube, you'll be doing yourself a favor.",5
rwby,"While volume 1 may come off as a cliche and poorly written excuse of a ""slice of life"" or ""Magical girl"" type anime, RWBY is quite the opposite. The show's willingness to constantly improve upon itself keeps you intrigued alongside the vast and captivating story. By the time you finish volume 3, you'll be begging for answers. An anime that was created by a man with a dream, and four simple colors.Thank you Monty, you'll always be in our hearts.",4
ahiru-no-sora,"For fans of basketball, Ahiru no Sora sticks true to the sports roots: game rules, breakdown of plays, and a typical high school life in Japan. An array of characters makes the story very compelling. You already get a hint of each uprising character without it dragging the story. The show has a wonderful soundtrack composed by Hiroaki Tsutsumi, one of the composers for Dr. Stone. To address the elephant in the room, Kuroko no Basket fulfilled it's own ability to bring anime into basketball. However, Ahiru no Sora brings out the beauty of basketball into anime.",4.5
ahiru-no-sora,"I'm not really a fan of sports anime, but THIS GOT ME REVVED UP! The MC is great! I love his perseverance! The story looks really good and I love the animation! I can't wait for more episodes! Ok ok, I got too excited. Here's the plot: A kid that's short and gets bullied a lot enters his new high school for the first time, he heads to the basketball court straight away, but gets stopped by the basketball team members. He then challenges them to a game to get into the team. He then shows them his incredible basketball skills! Action, Fanservice, and Basketball.... What else do you need?!",5
ahiru-no-sora,"I really love this anime. I wouldn't say I'm a huge fan of sports anime, but I do enjoy Basketball and this series so far has an interesting and fun story arc. It's light hearted, funny, it draws you in, and you can't help but love the characters. This delinquent basketball team, that is trying to make something of themselves, really does grow on you right from the first episode! It's in my queue and I'll be watching it every week. I'll look forward to it.",5
ahiru-no-sora,"It was a little slow at first, but thank god I stuck with it! The next few episodes were amazing! I couldn't stop watching, everything was intense, fast, and incredible. Every shot, every pass, and every jump made it feel surreal and had a real impact! It is also quirky, hilarious, funny, and odd at times, but I am loving every single second of it! I am looking forward to hopefully see this series to go big. It really is an amazing show and I love the art style and characters. It has become one of my top best new sports anime this year!",5
ahiru-no-sora,"I have been watching sports anime for as long as I can remember and a lot of the tropes I saw growing up are present in this show. There is a clear inspiration from Slam Dunk where delinquent but talented players come back to the sport, and in tandem with talented freshman, take a no-name team to great success. The premise is almost identical to Dear Boys where a talented, but short basketball player from a basketball family comes into a school whose team lacks 5 players and consists of a great players who lost their love for the game because of their unsuccessful history. But despite the glaring similarities, the show has a certain charm to it, thanks in large part to the cast that makes me wanna keep watching. Beautiful animation doesn't hurt. I'm always excited when a great sports anime pops up and this one definitely has the makings of one from what I've seen so far! I'm excited for more episodes",5
ahiru-no-sora,"There's pretty much no flaw I can think of to this show. The creators depict basketball with the proper rules in perfect detail, as well as make an amazing plot for the show. It's inspiring to see the main character, being put down his whole life for being short while trying to play basketball, start to try his hardest to play official basketball, eventually turning a team of thugs who didn't care for the game into a team with amazing potential. It creates inspiration, it shows that even when people constantly put you down you can still get up and make something of yourself, and that's why I enjoy this show.",5
ahiru-no-sora,"I'm so excited to see this finally become an anime. The manga began in 2003, so the character design definitely looks much different then what most are used to now. Although i personally love the art direction, i can understand why some may be turned off by this. This series is definitely less over-the-top then something like Kuroko, so if you're looking for something with flashy color lights with characters of all colors of the rainbow, maybe you should look there. Will definitely keep watching weekly",5
ahiru-no-sora,"If you're like me and absolutely adore sports animes then Aihiru no Sora is an excellent pickup. The main character is quickly likable, and while some may draw some similarities to Haikyu with a short protagonist in a tall person's sport, their story lines are entirely unique to one another.In fact, they are rather opposite. Haikyu's team is a well rounded group of individuals that support and raise the baby bird that is Hinata. Whereas in Aihiru no Sora, the highly adept Kurumatani has to shape a rowdy group of high school punks into a respectable basketball team.However, they do share some similarities in passionate players, excellent music, and fluid animation with lots of technical terms from their respective sports. I would highly recommend both shows.",5
ahiru-no-sora,"I'm not normally one to write reviews here, but after seeing the number of... frankly puzzling positive reviews this show has been getting, I felt compelled to play the part of the contrarian.The last few years have been a great time for fans of sports anime. A new wave of great shows - Hajime no Ippo: New Challenger, Kuroko no Basket, Baby Steps, Haikyuu, Ace of Diamond, and Hinomaru Sumo, among others - have really pushed the genre to new and exciting heights in terms of both storytelling and animation. It was my hope, when starting Ahiru no Sora, that this show would follow in the footsteps of those greats. Those hopes lasted... about 90 seconds into the first episode, but I stuck it out for the first three episodes hoping things would improve. Needless to say, they didn't.The StoryWhen you get right down to it, sports anime tend to be pretty formulaic, particularly when it comes to team-based sports like basketball (or baseball, or volleyball, or whatever). The protagonist, a highly-skilled but underappreciated high school athlete, joins an underdog team of misfits and losers, helps them bond and improve, and leads them into games against a bunch of strong, antagonistic teams, usually in a big tournament.Ahiru no Sora follows this formula to a tee, and brings virtually nothing new to the table. Sora, the protagonist, is a super-skilled, super-positive, super-bland main character who nobody takes seriously because he's a short guy playing basketball (gasp!). If this is giving you flashbacks of Kuroko in Kuroko no Basket, Hinata in Haikyuu, or Hinomaru in Hinomaru Sumo, that's because this trope has been done to death in sports anime. Sora is basically a distillation of the most generic traits of the aforementioned characters, but lacks any of their charm - he's not as quirky as Kuroko, not as relatable as Hinata, nor as ferociously fun and attention-grabbing as Hinomaru. Sora's only real character traits are that he's... relentlessly nice to everyone, and he's super into basketball. Aside from that, there's a running gag where he attempts to confidently stand up to a group of bullies before getting beaten up, but that's about it. After three episodes, he's still pretty much a blank slate.The story revolves around Sora discovering that his school's basketball club has been overrun by delinquents, who use the club room as a hangout and don't actually play the game (again, if you've seen Hinomaru Sumo, this is nothing new). Naturally, his love for basketball and ""NEVER GIVE UP!"" attitude eventually convinces the team to begin taking the game seriously. As of the end of episode 3, there are only really two other characters who have gotten any development in the show: Chiaki, the token comedic relief character who is characterized as a lazy pervert, and Momoharu, the leader of the delinquents who secretly likes basketball but gave up on it, and is inspired by Sora to start training again. It's not really any more interesting than watching Yuma, the similar delinquent in Hinomaru Sumo, learn to appreciate the sport and develop his skills, but Momoharu's growth over the first 3 episodes is by far the most interesting thing the show has to offer. Sadly, the excruciatingly slow pace of the first three episodes makes it hard to stay invested.While Momoharu's character arc does offer a glimmer of hope that this show could turn it around, far too much of Ahiru no Sora simply feels like pointless filler. Large chunks of the first three episodes are taken up by scenes of Sora's delinquent teammates getting into street fights with gangs from rival schools, alongside ""comedy"" bits in which Sora helps his teammates peep on the girls' locker room, steal underwear from apartment balconies, and attempts a layup naked in order to convince his teammates to practice, while the actual ""sports"" part of this sports anime takes a back seat. In all, I'd estimate about 25% of this show thus far has actually been focused on basketball, while the rest is either pointless filler or comedy that falls completely flat.Now, a slow start isn't always the end of the world in a sports anime. Some shows, like Ace of Diamond and Hajime no Ippo, have very slow starts, with more focus being placed on establishing characters than diving right into the sports stuff. If the characters and story being told were more interesting, or if the show were at least nice to look at, I'd still be willing to give it a shot. But sadly, neither of those things are true. Which brings us to...The AnimationSo to start with, I'll just come out and say it: dear God this show is ugly. Considering how many beautiful anime, sports and otherwise, are being made in 2019, it's crazy to me that a show with animation this bad is actually being watched by anyone.The best evidence of the low quality of the animation in Ahiru no Sora is, I think, the OP. An OP is typically where a show will put its best foot forward. Oftentimes some of the animators' most exciting, fluid animated sequences are featured, along with highly stylized visuals and creative transitions to build hype for the show itself. Ahiru no Sora's OP does none of these things. About 2/3 of the OP is taken up by simple long shots showing the main cast doing generic activities: running, hanging out in the club room, drinking water, etc., or just still single frames being panned over. What actual basketball action is shown in the OP is weirdly jerky and poorly animated, with occasional fast cuts to extreme close-ups of Sora's feet or hands to give viewers the impression that he's doing something flashy and athletic... without actually animating anything flashy or athletic. Even if we're not comparing to the best sakuga-laden sequences of the OPs in any of the other shows I've mentioned (and yes, there are 10-second clips in Kuroko or Haikyuu's OPs that make Ahiru no Sora's OP look like it was drawn with crayons), this OP just isn't good - it has very little character, very uninspired visuals, and nothing that gets me hyped up to see more.In transitioning into the show proper, these problems remain. The animation, particularly in the basketball sequences, just feels janky and ""off"". Forget about the creative, highly-stylized sequences of Kuroko or Hajime no Ippo that turn mundane actions into something out of a superhero movie - even compared to much more grounded, realistic shows like Haikyuu and even Baby Steps (which is far from perfect in terms of animation), the basketball sequences here are either poorly drawn while using the absolute minimum number of frames, or glossed over with lazy shortcuts. A good example of this laziness can be seen whenever Sora drives to the basket against his opponents (about once per episode): the effect is achieved with a single, abrupt cut. One moment he's dribbling in front of them, then the camera cuts to a close up of someone's eyes or feet, then suddenly there's another cut and Sora is behind them, with no actual animation frames showing his movement (and yes, I know Kuroko's Vanishing Drive did this as well, but (1) a character suddenly turning invisible worked far better in a show that already featured ridiculous, over-the-top super powers, and (2) his disappearing and reappearing were always dramatically represented with smooth, stylish visuals and sound effects, rather than abrupt, nonsensical cuts).The ugliness of the basketball sequences feels, in truth, like an extension of the show's overall aesthetic. The character designs themselves aren't terrible, but the show is plagued with off-model frames and wonky, inconsistent proportions (especially Sora's legs in some specific shots... seriously, pay attention to this and you'll start noticing it constantly), even in non-action sequences. Environments are generically drawn with as little detail as possible, which leads to the school and world in general feeling hollow and lifeless. Making matters even worse, the show's overall color palette feels strangely drab and washed-out, especially compared to the vibrant, eye-catching colors of most modern sports anime. I get the feeling that the animators were going for a ""grounded, realistic"" feel for the show, but didn't really have the talent and/or budget to pull it off and instead came up with something that just looks outdated and mediocre instead.The ConclusionFor fans of sports anime, I can't imagine watching this show and not feeling as if you'd rather be watching one of a dozen different shows that do what Ahiru no Sora is attempting to do, but far better. And for people who aren't into sports anime, I'd hate for a show this uninspired to be their introduction, as the genre has a ton to offer and deserves more fans than it has. The only people I could imagine truly enjoying this show are people who already love the source material (I haven't read it), or people who simply have a categorical love for all sports anime, regardless of quality.And if that's the case, I sincerely hope they enjoy this show - but for anyone else, I'd stay far away. If you want a basketball anime, watch Kuroko no Basket instead. Or, if Super Saiyans playing basketball isn't your thing (and if that's the case, what's wrong with you!?), watch Slam Dunk. Despite having been made 25 years ago the animation is basically on par with what Ahiru no Sora has to offer, with far better characters and story behind it.",5
ahiru-no-sora,"I was super skeptical about this anime from the description.  That skepticism grew after the 1st episode, but decided to stick with it for a bit.  The 2nd episode was better.  I still found it slow, but I began to like the idea of a ""bad gang boys turn good"" story line.  I thought it could have a lot of potential. Unfortunately after the 3rd episode, I'm throwing in the towel.  Although I think the premise with the potential gang storyline mixed in is a great idea, the follow through fell flat.  It's too slow and tedious to keep my interest.  Too bad.  I really though after episode 2 that this was going to pick up.",5
bleach,"Overall, for people who don't want to read: I recommend the first part of the series, up to the end of Soul Society, but not past that. The story started out nicely with few bad points, but later was prone to Kubo's horrible storytelling and inconsistencies.Don't get me wrong; I loved Bleach when I started watching it years ago. I even jumped into the manga just to get that extra little bit of story out.I'll start out with the good stuff.Bleach looks damn cool. Who doesn't like Death Gods with swords (not scythes) and black kimonos? Plus the idea of swords with abilities is pretty fun. The beginning (up to early 2006) was promising and I wholeheartedly recommend the beginning of this series. Just don't be disappointed by the recent developments.But, after the several asspulls and Kubo writing himself into corners in recent years, I can't recommend the post-Soul Society part of the series to anyone looking for good storytelling and consistency:1. Most of those seated officers in Soul Society who were introduced (or just shown in cover art) early in the series either appeared a few times or once. Good writers generally avoid huge casts, yet Kubo gave us a huge cast that was largely ignored except in omakes and the little comedy gold mines at the end of each episode.2. The Hueco Mundo arc looks oddly familiar... Ichigo goes to save the girl, travels to another world where anything can happen, fights all the ranked/uniformed baddies, makes a few friends among the locals (who were totally ignored since early 2009), and gains another power. I'll ignore the powerup since this is shonen, but the whole fiasco reminds me of an earlier arc: Soul Society. They're both rescue missions in another world with similar antagonists. Another world, same story.3. Powers are inconsistent. Yeah, this is a shonen, where power can fluctuate depending on emotion or some other crap, but since when did a Shinigami's ultimate skill, Bankai, get so freakishly depowered? Bankai is supposed to be rare, yet all the baddies we see can always shrug off a normal attack easily and almost always require bankai just to show how powerful they are. Just to note, Ichigo was able to defeat three lieutenants barehanded (vol. 18, ch. 152) yet has a hard time with the Bounts (anime only), Arrancars, etc. Unless Kubo forgot about the non-captain Shinigami power levels, Soul Society has little use for those fodder beyond the menial purifying of lesser hollows. Why not just send in captains to Hueco Mundo and the War? Oh wait... that's what they did.For manga readers:Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hide4. Aizen specifically gains a powerup each time he is almost defeated in all of 2010. This is all attributed to the blatant plot device known as the Hougyoku, which manifests the desires of those around it and advances the Hueco Mundo/War plots. It is the cause of Orihime and Chad's powers and Aizen's nearly omnipotent powers.5. Aizen knew about and manipulated Ichigo since he was born. Since when does a plot twist like this work well in storytelling? Never. And, why hasn't it been mentioned before? Kubo could've slipped in a simple ""he's grown"" line for Aizen, but there has been nothing hinting at this relation.6. How hard is it to introduce a group that isn't like the Visored (Yes, apparently the Vizard spelling is wrong) who are just there to help Ichigo regain/master another skill to fight some new enemy? Xcution will probably be ignored in the future, like the Visored.7. Give Ichigo a cool shockwave skill and everything's fine. Upgrade that shockwave with a black color, and it's still okay. But, nothing's ever been mentioned about a higher level version of the skill that has nothing to do with shockwaves. In fact, it's just raw strength at the cost of Ichigo's Shinigami powers. The Ultimate Getsuga Tenshou is completely unrelated to the original skill.When there is nothing relating shockwaves to raw strength, we can usually assume a powerup like this doesn't exist... EXCEPT in Bleach. Bleach is open to any and all powerups, without regard to foreshadowing or planning. The Final Getsuga Tenshou exists only in Kubo's Bleach, where he probably wrote himself into a corner and couldn't find another way out except with a never-before-hinted asspull of a powerup. Yes, Crunchyroll has this very same skill on the top of the page when I wrote this, but I'm just putting this out there under my spoiler tag.8. After building Aizen up for hundreds of chapters (or since the end of 2005) as a big baddie who gets all these powerups, Kubo rushes the ending and lets Ichigo and Urahara beat him in 5 chapters. Talk about anticlimactic... Sheesh... 9. The art quality in the anime sometimes dips (like most long-running shonen series). The swordfights sometimes devolve into crossed swords, sparks, and angry stares. Though it's probably necessary, the plot advances a chapter every episode, which is already a snail's pace. It's a bit of a waste of time when the same story takes 23 minutes to watch and five minutes (a minute for recent chapters) to read.10. Speaking of reading times, the recent chapters in the manga are filled with full page backgrounds and character faces. Neither are very detailed, especially the backgrounds. The dialogue is sparse, unnecessary, and unimportant. Does it really take a page to ask Ichigo what he wants to drink, another to announce another new character is back, or to open a door? And, why are there half pages filled with black or blocky backgrounds?Edit:11. Kubo rewrote the canon to the humans' powers THREE times. Read the manga or check out this spoiler tag.Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideFirst, Chad and Inoue's powers came from Ichigo's excess reiatsu, then from the Hōgyoku, and now from hollow attacks before birth. Sheesh...Edit 2:Want to get a jumpstart on how to make fun of Bleach? Take a look at this: http://gliblord.livejournal.com/23557.htmlAnd let me add a quote directly from Kubo:""I think when I am drawing, I wasn't just clarifying the lines, but illustrating the 'air'. Therefore, no matter in drawing or writing, neither words nor lines, but singularly illustrating the 'air'. I always have this feeling of bringing the 'air' into the paper when drawing. How to phrase it, every panel should have a background. Backgrounds are drawn to remind the reader where is the characters situated. However, I feel that it was not that important. In this manner, at the very panel when a character is exceptionally distinctive, I don't feel like filling the background at all.""",5
bleach,"This anime has a great premise. It has cool characters. It has sweet action. The first 60 episodes are phenomenal, and have you on the edge of your seat. The first 60 episodes are well written, well paced, and are epic. Then... the show gets drawn out. The suspense is gone, the goal that drove the main characters is gone, and they are left preparing to fight an incredibly overpowered antagonist. It drags on and on for 200 episodes, which contains a few epic fights, but is mostly boring and repetitive. Then it picks up real well for two final, epic battles, with a climax that is impressive and great. Then it ends around episode 315ish and you are satisfied with the great ending. Then the show keeps on going. For no reason. And it sucks. So here is how you watch the show: watch the first 60 episodes, skip around through the next 200 episodes (many of these are filler), watch several of the many final boss fights, then stop when the climax ends (you will know when it ends). Then stop. Stop and don't be tempted to keep watching. Be satisfied.",4.5
bleach,"Started watching this on late Adult Swim anime dub nights back in 2006, and was hooked and singing the first ED ""Life is like a Boat"" with Rukia as my favorite character. Fast forward six years, and here I am, with Rukia finally getting her first haircut (but nevertheless still my favorite character) and the ""apparent"" ending of Bleach's anime at episode 366. Whether you're a hater or a lover of the series, Bleach gives you a broad gray zone. You can be totally in love with the series for a few interesting arcs, then a nonchalant hater for the boring middle arcs, and suddenly a hardcore fan at the ending. It's all about timing and if you yourself have the time. Bleach is great. I'm recommending it. It's one of those classics that happen every now and then. It rode its wave of fame, and now it's slightly waning. One Piece is the same, even if you disagree, it's the truth. But anyway. Yes. Watch it. If you like the supernatural, interesting plots, and mindblowing cool fights, you'll like Bleach. If you like the cutesy romance and shoujo cliches... well, you should still probably try it.--- A bit of the other... stuff ---Music: Great OPs and EDs. Gendou has lots of them if you want to download them btw. (No aff) But action/fighting music is repetitive. (For example, arrancar arc) You might get tired of it soon. Graphics: Wonderful. Loved the hi-def SD at the end. The beginning quality is pretty good for SD here at CR, but the DVDs are the real thing either way. Plot: Yes, I admit. It's repetitive. Usually involves a girl being kidnapped and later saved by the ""hero"". But the getting to the girl is sometimes pretty interesting. Some arc endings may leave you unsatisfied. But episode 366 is satisfying. Basically you'll realize that whenever Ichigo gets the same power as you... you can be sure he'll rock it harder than you ever will.",4.5
bleach,"This is both a manga and an anime review, about Tite Kubo's Bleach. Lets start with a synopsis for those who are looking to start watching or reading Bleach. Bleach follows a teenage high school student named Ichigo Kurosaki, who has the ability to see spirits. One day he meets a girl in black robes named Rukia who exorcises a spirit and claims to be a Shinigami (God Of Death) who's purpose is to exorcise spirits and destroy evil spirits called Hollows. Shortly after Ichigo's family is attacked by a Hollow and when Rukia becomes injured she transfers her Shinigami powers to Ichigo transforming him into a Shinigami. As Rukia has now lost her powers Ichigo must become the Shinigami for his town and protect it from attacks by the Hollows.I must say now I love Bleach. Its fantastic, full of action, great characters good story lines and very funny comedy. The manga art right at the beginning isn't totally amazing but as you get further in the art becomes fantastic, very original character design's and just overall amazing. Being a battle manga obviously there are some epic fights but its the fighting concept that makes it very original. Unlike Naruto, Dragonball Z and some other popular shonen manga's this is a sword based battle manga. Each Shinigami has a sword or Zanpakuto that is unique to each Shinigami. While nearly all Zanpakuto look alike (medium sized katana's) Ichigo's is almost like a huge broadsword. Rukia comments that a Zanpakuto's size represents their power so straight away we know Ichigo's character is going to be special. As we progress through the story we find that the Zanpakuto's have different stages which give the wielder different abilities, Much enjoyment from the manga is seeing the wide variety of Zanpakuto's and the different abilities that they contain.Bleach also has one of largest character rosters of regulars ive seen in a while, but the characters are so interesting it doesn't overwhelm the story or other characters. The main characters are Ichigo, Rukia, and Ichigo's school friends Orihime, Chad, Ishida (a Quincy) and a shop owner named Urahara who has considerable knowledge of the Shimigami world known as the Soul Society. As a main character Ichigo is great. He's the strong silent type, is fairly intelligent ranking in the top 50 (no. 23) out of the entire school for test scores. Its during this time we find more about Ichigo's personality. Because Ichigo has orange hair its popular belief amongst the teachers and students who don't know him that he bleaches or dyes his hair and due to that fact gets into many fights with older students and due to the fights (and hair) teachers believe him to be a delinquent, so he studies for tests to get good pass marks so teachers will leave him alone. Ichigo also doesn't like to share his feelings opting to close himself of from the people around due to witnessing his mothers death when he was young, adding a slight bit of tragedy to the character.Like everything Bleach isn't perfect. A problem often cited that doesn't really bother me much is the lack of romance. Its generally female fans who comment on this but some males have found the lack of Ichigo havintg an interest in a female character less convincing than some of the other shonen heroes such as Naruto. Also the story arcs are extremely long compared to some other mangas and can drag out for a good while. Bleach sometimes falls prey to some cliches as well but its so rare its hardly an issue.All in all Bleach is amazing and I would recommend it to any fan of anime or manga. Its exciting, original and has a few good unexpected twists down the line.",4.5
bleach,"The series follows 15 year old high school student Kurosaki Ichigo, and the adventures he has dealing with his rather unusual ability, as a substitute Soul Reaper. This series is filled with drama, intense battles, and some comedy on the side. Overall, I strongly think you should check this Anime out.   Animation is great. When there is swordfights, they almost relate to real swordfighting, technique wise, they have the animations of the sword movements drawn out perfectly. In fights, the characters have special techniques that are fictional, but create a great suspense. Characters are great and thought out for the most part. Each main character has its own story and they all see action sometime in the series. Music is a great aspect in this series. It adds more emotion to everything and it makes certain scenes more important. The music can make the scenes sadder, more action packed, or they describe a certain characters mood. Music does a great part in Bleach Storyline is side tracked in some episodes by filler arcs, but for the most part, Bleach is fun and action packed, and you will want to see every episode.",4.5
bleach,"I have read the entire manga series before watching the anime, and personally, I like the manga a little bit better. Both the manga and the anime are amazing, though. You will definitely become attached to the characters and the plot will drag you in. One you've started watching/reading Bleach, you can't stop. I've introduced some of my friends to Bleach and they've become just as addicted as me. It's an overall great anime",4.5
bleach,just watch it and get sucked in. from the moment i caught a glimpse of my friend watching this i had to ask what was this action packed masterpiece filled with a one of a kind story line was. after watching a few of the English episodes and catching up to my friend i needed more. i became so into it that just 30 minutes wasn't enough for me so i found this site and proceeded watching. And now the jokes on me because i still have to wait a week or so for the newest releases.,2.5
bleach,"I absolutely loved Bleach. The humor, fighting, drama, and plot was amazing. People would argue against the numerous amount of fillers, but it you trully appreciated the character development and overall series, watching the fillers was never a problem!I highly recommend, but I always give a warning ... there's 366 episodes! Choose the time you start watching wisely, because it's had me pull all nighters.",2.5
bleach,"Bleach characters are Awesome. Which kind of makes it sad because this anime had so much more potential if Tite Kubo had order some stuff in the manga in a different way that would have made some stuff more interesting.This anime has a lot of great action.The down side of this anime is that it has a lot of  filler episodes and it didn't mix in with the anime at the appropriate time.Sometimes it would come in the middle of nowhere and had nothing to do at all with want was going on at that time.So I would skip episode 33,50,64-109,128-137,147-149,168-189,204-205 213-214, 227-265,284,287, 297-298, 303-305, 311-342, and last but not least 355.Add all this together and you get 166 filler episodes which brings down the episode count to 200. If you skip the OP and ED songs 3 minutes and skip the 4  minute recaps on later episodes then you can watch 3 episodes per hour. Bleach anime should really be remade in the future.",2.5
bleach,"Ichigo Kurosaki, is a protag with orange hair and Rukia Kuchik, is a soul reaper. I have to say Rukia Kuchik, is fiery. It's rare that there is a female character in an anime that is both ""calm"" ""edgy"" and ""energetic"" all at once. ""Ichi"" and ""Ruki"" interact with each other in a well seasoned kind of way. These two make the show steam like soul food. They fill the air with a nice aroma.Originally I thought Bleach was for kids, and in some ways it is, but it has a deep story that is contrasted beautifully by action and comedy. It's a rare mix.  Other anime studios try to pull this off but it rarely works. Overall this reminds me of Death Note meets Inu Yasha. As far as the animation, the anime is drawn more ferocious than what's happening now. Shonen Jump usually brings this to the table.You can probably watch this with your kids and enjoy it.Bleach is a must ""wash"". lol.",2.5
bleach,"NOTE*-(This is a proper short review, not a usless 5 star! best anime ever useless review.)-Bleach, an anime centered around Ichigo, a ""Highschool student-turn-Shinigami (reaper)"" is a good anime. Having a great main story-line with loads of action packed fight scenes. HOWEVER, for a long running anime Bleach in all honesty is only 'Good' not Great. The early episodes of this anime proved to be one of the best and most interesting fighting anime's out there. The main story-line was great however the arcs (fillers) have most definately been stretched out much too long. The fillers in Bleach let the anime lose its momentum in terms of excitement. The fight scenes also sometimes feels too repetitive stretching out for 8 episodes sometimes which honestly makes the fighting seem a lot less intense as some fights can definately be made in half the episodes. The characters also are not very unique in a sense, several characters differ greatly from each other of course, however most of the villains and many of the shinigami are actually not entirely unique. Ichigo, being the protagonist sometimes also lacks what usually a main character in a fight anime needs; in all honesty besides the orange hair, he's not a very UNIQUE 'hero' as if you just change his hair color to black, he can definitely pass off as a sub character.Even with these faults, the overall story-line in this anime as well as the excellent music and animation which is pretty much as good as it gets for any anime proves to make this anime a lot more captivating. However i still believe that this anime seems 'Over rated' as a lot of the time the anime can most definitely improve, luckily seeing as the later episodes after the 'Aizen Storyline' seem to be more fast paced which is perfect for an anime like this. Overall, Bleach - 4/5 stars.The main story-line is great (manga) but how they put it together in the anime with the arcs let the anime down - 3.5/5 starsThe music is great, having epic instrumental music is great for a fight anime! - 4.5/5 starsThe characters, simply can be made more different, especially Ichigo - 3.5/5 starsFinally, the animation is one of the best that can be seen in any fighting anime series, no complaints. - 5/5 starsA great anime for those who love fighting anime (Naruto/One piece etc.) However, my opinion entirely, it's only an average anime out there.",2.5
bleach,"Many of the arcs are really good.  Lots of fighting and interesting storylines, but every once in a while you get a real lame bit.  Not to say that should entirely take away from the show.  It is still a definite must see, but be warned there are parts that will make you say what the heck?!  The action is fantastic, especially when Ichigo (main character) gets angry.  Give it a try, you will be happy you did!",5
bleach,"BLEACHBleach' is a story of Ichigo Kurosaki, a high-school student that can see ghosts and spirits- as the main character.Suddenly, a 'person' comes into his room, and -of course- Ichigo react reflecty; kicks that 'person' on the face!That 'person', that feels Ichigo've been rude, says; 'What's that for?' but actually this person is shocked, cuz this person is actually a shinigami (death god, soul reaper) which means this shinigami is a spirit, that can't be seen by most of the people.But, this shinigami isn't coming without reason. She, comes to the world of living, to kill hollows (bad spirits) and send them to Soul Society.Then, after that weird meeting, this shinigami sys her name; Rukia. and Rukia needs Ichigo's help.And that's how it work, until Rukia must give her shinigami powers to Ichigo; which is, actually, kinda a taboo.But Rukia must do it, cuz hollows are attacking Ichigo's house: and, Rukia is actually wants to give some of her powers, but Ichigo's body absorb ALL of her powers.Then, automatically, Ichigo becomes a soul reaper.He kills and kills, then send them to Soul Society, until a big problem comes..Rukia's mistake, to send her power to Ichigo, have been heard by Soul Society, so, her brother, Byakuya Kuchiki [6th company's captain], with her best friend [Byakuya's vice captain] come to the world of living, to pick her and deliver her to the punishment.Ichigo wants to keep Rukia in his side, but he's not strong enough to kill Byakuya, or even Renji.He's the only one who's bleeding, not Byakuya or Renji.But, Ichigo isn't a guy who cries in a problem.He always try, without fear.So he, who was been saved by Urahara, study how to fight and how to face enemies,and after that, with his classmates Chad, Ishida, Orihime, and Yoruichi [sensei], and of course with Urahara's help, he go to Soul Society to rescue Rukia.blah blah blah, after Ichigo fights tons of shinigami, with tons of helps from tons of people, Rukia is save now.But the series isn't end yet! There's still enemies, which is, actually, the former shinigami that died before; Aizen Sousuke, with his gang Gin Ichimaru and Kaname Tousen, plus those mighty Arrancars, Espadas, and Fraccions.""Howl, Zabimaru!"" -Abarai Renji""Reap, Kazeshini."" -Shuuhei Hisagi""Raise your head, Wabisuke."" -Kira Izuru""Sit upon the frozen heavens, Hyorinmaru!"" -Hitsugaya Toushiro",4
bleach,"This anime has some of the coolest music and unique art of all time. The first couple story arcs were truly laudable and what followed showed exactly how lame tite kubo really is. There are ACTUALLY multiple filler arcs that weren't in the manga. These arcs were inane, came out of nowhere, and took away from an overall strong storyline. The ending (of the anime, as the manga is ongoing, but not looking much better lol) was a travesty and did not give what this anime deserved.",5
bleach,"Bleach is pretty good all in all yet it does come with its own amount of flaws. Filler is a big problem in bleach so big it will interrupt the main story arc while the arc is happening. Most people just skip these parts, but the fact that these parts exists and become an issue is disheartening. It would be fine if these filler stories were good, but a majority of the time they are not. The bount saga felt very out of place, like it was taken from a failed anime and just put in with bleach characters. The arc about the swords coming to life brings up major plot holes that are in the show. These filler arcs just ruin it for me, and the last arc of bleach is also really lack luster. If you love bleach and you watch it all the way through please go read the manga. The Manga is still going and its getting really good. If anything I hope they bring bleach and animate this true final arc.",5
bleach,"this is going to be very concise, Bleach as an overall anime deserves 2 stars, 3 at most in my opinion. This is just because of the lengthy, boring, and plot pointless filler 'arcs', I actually watched Bleach without watching most of these fillers because they are completely pointless to the plot, and most of them are absurd and a waste of time to watch. That being said, without watching the bad fillers, or without all the fillers completely, Bleach gets the 4 star rating. Now not all fillers are bad, just the lengthy ones. A good example of a good filler is whenever they show Ichigo's 2 sisters, Kon, and the old dude (forgot his name) fighting hollows as a sort of Kaman rider homage. But to be fair though all of these long running anime's like Bleach, Naruto, and One Piece tend to have a ridiculous amount of uninteresting fillers. I recommend Bleach to anyone who will just skip the fillers, and to people who don't mind them.",5
bleach,"Bleach had such promise for me, interesting powers, plots, characters. I dove into it headfirst watching until I had caught up, it was after I caught up a few years back that I realized the series was doomed. I loved up to episode 64, that's when things started to go bad. So I am going to review this show as if it is two separate shows. Before episode 64:  The beginning of the series was really awesome, the plot that a shinigami saved a normal boy and made him a substitute shinigami, a whole world of spirits and beings separate from ours in a different light. All the powers and characters you met were interesting, the fight with Kenpachi, everything was brilliant. I only had good memories up until this point, which is why I recommend people pretend the following episodes don't exist. Because even if they introduced cool characters it all went downhill, I've heard the manga is better, so if you want to continue past this point I recommend going to the manga.After episode 64:  It showed promise at first, there were bigger scarier hollows, more powers, cool new characters. The Arrancars, espadas, it looked so promising. But fillers, and lack of character growth, along with other faults made the series become a bother to watch, but I powered through, that is until there was about 30 or more episodes of filler at a time. Only to have one real episode and then continue filler. After that I gave up. This isn't really one of my best reviews, but more or less a warning and a recommendation. Bleach is a good anime only to episode 63. So if you like Shonen, go watch it, but either stop at 64 or go to the manga.",5
bleach,"Summary:Ichigo Kurosaki is a highschooler who is turned into a Substitute Death God and helps protect is little town called Karakura. Over the course of the show new more powerful enemies appear and he trains and grows in strength in order to protect those he cares for. Overall Score: 9/10Bleach is the best anime I have seen so far, but I won't give a show a 10/10 unless it has absolutely no flaws.Anime 10/10The anime in this show is gorgeous. I love the character design, colors, effects, scenes, everything. Nothing to add here.Plot: 8/10If the show had ended when *Spoiler Alert* Ichigo defeats Aizen around episodes 305-310, and there weren't so many fillers, it would have received a 10/10. I feel everything after was extra and unnecessary. The plot is well developed I love how the story progresses, the introduction of new characters, the plot twists, the increase in powers throughout the series, the enemies, pretty much everything.Characters: 10/10There are many loveable characters. Even the enemies had something that keeps the viewer entranced and wanting to know what happens to them. There are many filler characters that aren't necessary to the overall show, but each character has a unique place. The characters can be related to and have parts we wish we had or wish we didn't have. They are well structured and the feel of each character stays pretty much the same throughout the show. Fillers: 8/10There are A LOT of fillers in this show. Even some of the major arcs in the show seem to be fillers. However, compared to other shows I've watched (*Cough* Naruto), these fillers are relatively entertaining. This is one of the few animes I've watched all the way through twice, so I mean it when I say, they are obnoxious, but not unbearable. Final Thoughts:Would recommend this show 100%. While it is not the perfect anime, it is the closest  I have experienced so far. It has a lot of fillers, but some are entertaining, and some fill in plot holes later on in the show. It is complete so don't be expecting anymore episodes.*Hint* If you love swords, WATCH THIS SHOW! There are too many epic sword fights to count, and it is all animated beautifully to boot!",5
bleach,"Bleach starts off great continues along great, and is an all around a really good anime. The only problem I found when watching, is the constant interruptions. Here you are watching some really epic battle, it's lasting multiple episodes. You finish one episode, at a key moment in the battle so you quickly leap to the next episode. Well there's the problem. The creators seemed to have a bunch of ideas but are too lazy to give them their own seperate part in the show. So they shove a few random episodes in the middle of the series. This anime would be much better with a simple plot line, instead of multiple complex ones. If you insist on watching the interrupting episodes,well, I warned you. Happy watching!",5
bleach,"I haven't actually watched anything beyond the whole arrancar saga end, but that's because I felt like Bleach ended so perfectly right then and there that I didn't need to watch any more. Personally, I felt that Bleach started off really strong, then totally lost it's value through the whole ending stages of rescuing Rukia and then picked up pace by the time he fought Grimmjow. After that, it climaxed beautifully and ended perfectly. Props to Bleach, it's definitely my favorite out of the ""big anime"" that's out there right now. I <3 you Bleach! You've been so great! Here's to 6 great years!",4.5
bleach,"This is a very good anime with a great story line all the way through, excluding fillers, and i think it may be one of my favorite anime. The only problem is that it has quite a few filler arcs but that is not a problem if you have a guide to avoid the fillers but some of the fillers are not bad. It is action packed, funny tense and emotional and all round a great anime with everything to be expected.",4.5
bleach,"The development for the protagonist ''Kurosaki Ichigo'' ,a shinigami/teenage male, never bores me. The intensity is well built up making me gush out excitement. The only problem would be how the author ended the anime and didnt continue it. Made me kinda pissed off but I overall enjoyed Bleach. The manga is still ongoing but I still haven't had a chance to read it ( too busy ) but I would highly recommend Bleach. It focuses on the struggles and sacrifices a teenage boy has to go through. Very well done! The art is great and the fighting scenes make me fall off my chair! I did not regret taking my time to watch Bleach! Go ahead and watch it! You will probably find it hard to not click on the next episode.",4.5
bleach,"I don't even know where to begin! This anime is truly amazing. It has so many twists and turns and will keep you wanting more. As long as it is, it is not surprising if some find it slow to begin with but it picks up speed and fast. Many, many people complained about the fillers it had but I enjoyed all of them. The character development is the best I've seen yet. The plot as well, seeing the characters face and overcome so many obstacles was a real joy. With 366 episodes and 4 movies, I've never seen an anime as good as this. I hope others enjoy it as enthusiastically as I did.",4.5
bleach,"This is what they should put in front of the manga and anime of Bleach~WARNING: The following anime is extremely addictive and can/will cause lost of sleep, obsession and procrastination. Viewer Discretion is STRONGLY advised Lots of fight scenes, beautiful art and a good overall plot... ^o^I started watching it and after three days of 2-hours of sleep each day, I finished reading the manga and watching the anime. Remember,  once you start, you CAN'T stop. (Unless of course, you have inhuman mental strength to control yourself)",4.5
bleach,"If you grew up with shows like Dragon Ball Z, Rurouni Kenshin, and Yu Yu Hakusho and enjoy a series with an intricate story, interesting characters, and just downright awesome explosive fight scenes, then Bleach is the series that's made for you!  The pacing is admittedly pretty bad though (especially during the Arrancar arc) and there's a ton of filler episodes strewn throughout the series (the Zanpakuto Materialization and Reigai filler arcs are worth watching though), but the source material is great. Overall, Bleach is a series that once you start it, it grabs you and refuses to let you go!Just be sure to avoid the filler episodes as those are not based on the canon story from the original manga. Use this for reference:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleach_episodesAlso, be sure to read the manga after the final episode of the anime since the story continues in the manga. After episode 366 of the anime, start at chapter 480 of the manga.",5
bleach,"I love, love, love this anime. I am not very far but I am so glad to have found it. A friend recommended it to me and I never in a million years thought I would end up liking the scary looking Ichigo and shounen genre.The characters all have amazing qualities, to make you love or hate them and the development is really worth the watch.  Never a dull moment and even in the height of battle there is a line that has me on the floor laughing.I really cannot wait to get to the end, but I hope there are more episodes to come and that the ending will live up to the story.Rokia x Ichigo.",5
bleach,"Before saying anything, let me note that after my original posting of this review, I read a review by CrimsonTrickster on Aug 7, 2011 which was along the same lines as my review, but perhaps better stated, actually. Without further ado...If you like shounen anime as a genre, then the first several seasons of this show (basically, the ""Soul Society arc"") are just awesome. (So a lot of my scoring above reflects the entire anime to this point; the storyline numbers would probably be more like 4/5 for the first several seasons of the show.) Good points of the anime include:1. Pretty good plotting through the first part of the anime and well-conceived characters2. A nicely crafted world (i.e. an expansive, imaginative, and interesting world is created in which the story takes place) which is slowly revealed in increasing detail to the watcher and keeps you hooked3. Excellent animation overall4. A fair number of epic battlesMore recently (particularly since the beginning of the fake Karakura town arc, with the notable exception of Ichigo's battles with Grimmjow and Ulquiorra), however, the show's negative points have begun to overwhelm the positive ones, in my opinion. Some of these were problems from the beginning, but you live with them because of the good points. They include:1. A very large number of characters are tracked, and though it's nice to actually learn something about them, it often becomes tedious to spend multiple episodes focusing on each in turn.2. Outcomes of battles are woefully predictable, for the most part, and the show does not seem to operate under a unified notion of how strong different characters are (i.e. the winner of the battle tends to be whoever is convenient for the writer rather than the one the show hsa previously indicated is stronger).3. Very strong tendency to get lost in fillers.4. Characters and plotting become increasingly flat (even boring) in later episodes.In the early days, Bleach was the anime that got me hooked on anime generally speaking. I kept watching it for some time out of pure momentum, and every once in a while was rewarded (e.g. Ichigo vs. Ulquiorra--I can hardly stress enough how epic that was). If you're a shounen die-hard and live for those epic battles, Bleach may yet reward you if you stick with it. But if you're not, well...it might be worth checking out, but don't torture yourself searching for more if it starts to feel tedious for you, like it did for me. (At the very least, go away from it for several months to a year and then check back in to see if anything looks interesting.) This show is being milked, hard.One final note: In my opinion, the overall quality of the opening and ending music for this show is very high. I've found several J-pop artists that I like from the songs.",5
bleach,i love bleach and all but then there were to many fillers at some point and i started getting bored with it. then i stopped watching it altogether but i said to my self (i should watch it again) so i did and it didn't turn out as bad as i thought. thats the good thing bad thing is that bleach is getting to a point where ichigo wins every fight i understand how powerful is  and all but still let him lose alittle bit. plus the more ep they make the more ppl r going to get sick of it thats what i think.,5
bleach,"It was a great series but it could get boring at many points. The reason I thought it wasn't the greatest anime was because like many other large anime the producers only think of ways to make as many episodes as possible. This of course is the reason many episodes lack action and can not entrance the viewer like many other animes can. But overall the series is unique ,and had many suspenseful parts. Even though i had complaints i think it is a great action anime for all viewers.",5
bleach,I was a bit skeptical with bleach i was just getting into anime and has so far only watched Naruto and when i first started watching that  i wasn't sure how i felt until about episode 40 i just kept watching them so realised i liked it but with bleach from the first episode i knew that i loved it and i have been watching it up to this day i started watching bleach about two - three years ago and have ever looked back while i will admit sometimes the side stories go on forever and it takes a long time to get to the episode you want because of the fillers i love this anime and would reccomend it to anyone =D,5
bleach,"Bleach, despite its name, is a fairly good shonen anime. It has gained much popularity and has a uniqueness to it. As my review title shows, it has met my expectations but barely exceeds them. I will describe why.Storyline The main storyline is well thought out and does have some interesting parts to it, but overall the entire storyline lacks unity and is greatly inconsistent. The anime starts off with the main storyline but is abruptly disturbed by fillers. The majority of the anime is consisted of fillers that ruin the main storyline of  Bleach . The fillers of  Bleach do contain  some character development and introduces other powers in the  Bleach world. However, these new developments and introductions do little to help the actual main storyline. The main storyline and the fillers do not transition well and therefore I give the storyline a 3 star rating.Music There is never any ""bad"" music so I will not give any rating lower than a 5 star rating.Characters There is character development among the main characters of  Bleach , be it the protagonists or the antagonists. However, character development greatly lacks in other characters. No major protagonists have died, making  Bleach seem like an anime that shows that good guys always win and takes away from the realism. There are also slight inconsistencies within the characters. 3.5 star ratingAnimation The animation of  Bleach is not the best of them all. It lacks some detail and has some poor animations as well. The animation makes a slight change after the first few episodes of the anime. 4 star rating for OK animation.Overall there are inconsistencies and has very little phsycological impact. The characters in this anime are very particular with one on one combat and they follow the shonen type where they talk a lot during battle and drags the episodes on. They reveal their abilities to one another which makes the action less appealing. All in all, 3.5 star rating. Not the best anime despite what other says.",5
bleach,"I have been waiting for CR to make a debut for Bleach. I have been a fan of Bleach but due to the lack of episode promotions....I couldnt find a good site to watch it on....until I heard something crazy. CR just first start a poll what would people think if they would put Bleach on CR. Then when everyone made their staggering votes, it turned into a petition highering the voices of the CR nation. Once the creators got enough signatures (oversignatures is more like it), they turned it to TokyoPOP and all the other Anime producers....finally....CR was hosting Bleach...and when I heard, I was friggin stoked. I see new heights for BLEACH.",5
bleach,"Storyline - 3/5I admit, this number would be a lot higher if I had just stopped watching after Season 3.  The story for the first few seasons flow beautifully into the next part.   Combat can bog down and one fight can drag on for far too long.  Music - 3/5Not really a big factor for me but the music seems decent overall but has suffered from some really bad opening themes.Characters - 4.5/5This is where Bleach sets itself apart from the common anime.  The characters are about the best you will find in any anime.  From the main protagonist, Ichigo, to the comic relief of Kon, this is my favorite part of the whole series.  They go into detail about the daily life and past of the main cast, for the most part, and have a little bit for everybody.  However, after the first season, they start introducing more characters and pretty much never stop introducing new characters.  It is clear that Tite Kubo has a great feel for design but sometimes you just need to sit down and stop.Animation - 4/5About as good as you can expect from a series with 250+ episodes with no end in sight.  Some very nice combat sequences.Overall - 3.5/5As stated previously, I absolutely love the designs of the characters and the setting seems very strongly defined.  The animation is better than most would expect for such a long series.  However, the combats, while intense and well drawn, go on for several episodes sometimes and it just seems like Jump! and Kubo are milking the series for everything they can get out of it.  The series got so far way from the original feel and characters that it is like watching a completely different series at times.  If I could recommend just watching through the conclusion of the Soul Society arc and stopping before the Bount arc, it would be  fantastic series. Usually when anime gets too long you can pick up the manga and continue the story with that, but as Bleach is now I would strongly advise against the manga and only watch the first 3 seasons of the anime.  The series and the manga should have ended a year ago or at least concluded this story arc.",5
bleach,"I love this anime. This is by far the greatest anime I have seen, sorry Naruto S.But my main reason for writing this is not really for a review of the entire show, just one arc.Everybody says how great the show is except for the fillers. While for the most part I agree with their opinions, the Zanpakuto Tales arc(not sword fiends, that part sucked)was the best arc I have seen in any anime I have watched.Not only were the new characters awesome(some of them more so than there counterparts), the storyline was excellent.It gives more incite into the relationships between Shinigami and Zanpakuto. I also gained mad respect for, and understood Byakuyamuch better.",5

Bleach is full of action packed fighting, but has that dash of humor. I hope you come to enjoy bleach as much as I have.....  Enjoy!!!!!!",5
bleach,"Bleach is an anime about swords and shit. Every characters has their unique ability and this anime give a lot of the character time to shine. I do have a problem with the fillers as I feel like they are dragged out, but you can always skip them. Also fights in the later episodes are 99% talking (exaggeration!!!) and 1% fighting. Otherwise, it's a great anime with bad-ass characters and actions. I highly recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen it.",5
bleach,"I recall watching this anime a very long time ago. I really like this anime the action, it even had some comedy and overall was and AAA Anime. Why Two Stars you think????? FILLER- Random stuff anime creators do to catch up with the magna. Like wow you'll be in a middle of a fight and they randomly go somewhere else for 15 episodes or something... I couldn't take it=;((( on top of that the filler was not good... Just random.. Argh!!!!!! But I have time and I'm going to rewatch... Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hide I got as far when ichigo went to the shadow lands he was fighting..... someguy to save the girl I think...... but he had to fight a bunch of people...... they captured the girl......I think in the middle of that they randomly went to earth to save someone lol or some queen or something dumb",5
bleach,"I'll make this short. Bleach is one of the mainstream anime, all of which I have seen, but this has been the only one I have been able to watch all the way through. Naruto and One Piece along with Fairytail are simply just not as good. It might just be that Bleach has a story line that interested me much more then the rest. But it does have much more redeeming qualities then the others. I would suggest it to anyone interested or needing another anime to watch.",5
bleach,"*THE FOLLOWING REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*When I decided to watch Bleach because my friends said it was good, it was one of the best decisions of my life. I loved the story, the characters, the emotion, the action, and the humor. The music and animation was nice as well, it was all amazing. However, I started to notice common plot devices in the series after the Soul Society Arc, which made me consider if I should still watch the series or not. This includes Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideOrihime being captured and having to be rescued, just like Rukia was in the previous arc, plusSpoiler Alert! Click to show or hide a conspiracy about whether the person wanted to be saved or not. Also, Ichigo constantly got healed after he lost a fight, only to have a rematch and win, and then repeat the process. I couldn't really get a gauge on Ichigo's power, and it didn't really make sense to me that his power would increase that much after one fight, it's not like he had a Zenkai from Dragon Ball Z (If you don't get the reference, it's a power boost after recovering from a near death experience)! Additionally, the fillers are horrible. Just HORRIBLE. Be sure to find out which episodes are filler and skip them. On top of that, I foundSpoiler Alert! Click to show or hide the released Zanpakuto to be really repetitive after a while, since almost every Arrancar+Visored+Soul Reaper had this. Add them together and it's nearly 30 releases in the same arc. This last one is kind of a minor nitpick, but I don't really enjoy sword fights unless there is something super interesting about them. SinceSpoiler Alert! Click to show or hide there are nearly over 30 released Bankais in the Fake Karakura Town Arc, I quickly became uninterested in these fights. So, should you continue watching? If you don't agree with little to none of my reasons of not enjoying it as much after the first 2 arcs, you should still watch. However, if you agree with almost all to all of my points, I suggest watching another anime that will suit to your liking. I am actually going to continue watching the manga/anime past the Fake Karakura Town Arc (The arc that I'm currently on), but I honestly don't enjoy it as much as I did with the first 2 arcs.~My review: 4 out of 5 stars.",5
bleach,"I won't waste time with a synopsis you should know it by the time you get to this review. The characters are a bit older than the norm and that helps with the dire situations they face. The fate of the world is a heavy burden for a 12 year old.  Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hidethis review just saved you the trouble of watching neon genesis evangelion  It was good to see it handled by an older hero. Another good point is that it's co-ed. Neither gender is side lined into a role nor treated as naturally superior or inferior in any way. But that's not the question you want answered. The question is IS IT WORTH MY TIME TO INVEST IN A SERIES THIS LONG? And the answer is yes! The filler is bad but only so bad as to make one wish for the filler to end, rather than making the show unwatchable. What saves this show is the large and varied cast of unique characters. Each character has their individuality and a unique power to match, but all are trained in the same basic arts. This is why I found the series superior to Naruto in the fact that in Naruto, it seemed as though some characters could learn new and different jutsu while others could only modify their existing jutsu. Bleach solves this problem by making everyone’s zanpakuto different, yet all the basic abilities are the same. It's almost perfect a clever mix of humor and action that doesn't beat you over the head with things you already know.    But I felt the last season was a waste. Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideThey could have ended with Ichigo losing his powers and called it quits rather than spend a season giving Ichigo his powers back then ending the series. Those few more episodes aren't worth the finale. Also most of the supporting cast is missing from the final series So yes it's worth the watch, and I demand more, but only of Bleach at it's best please, and not at it's worst...",4
bleach,"Well, in the beginning I enjoyed the anime and it was pretty interesting. I loved watching bleach but now, I lost all interest in the show. It caught my attention a few years back when it was on Toonami satuday nights. I remember Ichigo learning about the soul society and getting these shinigami like powers. After they saved Rukia  I got bored. I guess I lost interest when it was Orihime in trouble not sure , but somewhere along the line I was disappointed in the anime. I guess the episodes got longer and they talked a whole lot more explaining unnecessary things like in Naruto. Other than that they anime was pretty ok ...",4
bleach,"This series has it's moments when it is truly fantastic, the characters, the action, the development is truly top knotch, but then... It fails at times..It saddens me that this series got split up by fillers, the main plot is good, great even and the first story-arc was truly the peak of this series, but as you get further, you start to notice the fillers... oh lord, the fillers. As other shows ususally try to go a bit easy on the fillers, somehow blend it into the story a little.. bleach pulls out a completely random filler arc which can last 20 episodes+, leaving you scratching your head for what really happened and what is supposed to be going on as this random story is spewed out..The anime is truly one I can reccomend, but I have to think twice as this anime feels somewhat parted, the fillers are of generally high quality, it's not that, but they are so long and tedious when you simply want the main story... In the end a great anime which deserves the brand ""Must watch"" but also is an example of how fillers should not be done",4
bleach,is it just me but ep 366 can not be the last episode did anyone here of an upcoming season? or why they ended it like that? That is the only confusing thing about this show. I wonder if japan did not think we where going to like it as much as we did or what?? I'm just in the shadow of the news on bleach so please anyone with the correct info. (not just guessing....lol) tell us bleach fans whats goin on,4
bleach,"Alot of people i know that watched this either stopped in a filler arc or got tired of the aizen/arrancar arc jumping around.With that said it is worth sticking to the end, even though the bount (filler) arc got extremely boring it didnt intrude on any other arc. the amagai arc was good but that one and the zanpaktu arc where fillers to give TK time to release more content. and it happens in transition from one arrancar part to another, its slightly annoying but understandable. the aizen arc came to a satisfying and mysterious end, which makes it 100% worth the wait. i would have like to see the rumored episode 367 and a continuation but i was overall satisfied with the way it all wound up",4
bleach,"I began watching Bleach when the first episode aired back in 2004. I was young at the time and I had yet to discover the beauty of subtitles so I watched it in English. It was intriguing, even to my young mind, and I thought that the English version was about as good as the show could get...until I found the internet. I have been watching Bleach religiously now for almost ten years and I have to say, I have yet to grow tired of this show. Although I am very upset that the anime has stopped, I can at least get my fix by reading the manga. I was very disappointed when the show was cancelled right before everything sort of blew up in the manga and I am still praying for a sudden return out of nowhere for this show. I love every single character (which rarely happens for me when it comes to any kind of television) and I simply love the music in this anime. The soundtracks are all amazing and I have most of the opening themes downloaded to my iPod. I would highly recommend this show to just about anyone who is looking for some good action and comedy all rolled into one brilliant bundle. Ichigo is one of my favorite characters and the development of his character is simply amazing. Renji also holds a spot in my heart not only because of that wonderful red hair but also because of his personality and even though I wouldn't consider him one of the main characters his character still develops nicely throughout the series. Every single character within this show, whether main or minor, has grown and changed throughout the series which not many shows can brag they've accomplished. I would honestly say that this show rivals Naruto and I am most definitely a Naruto fanatic. I have been with both shows since the very first episode and I'll be with them until the very end (which I hope never comes for either). I hope more people can find this show/manga just as enjoyable as I did!",4
bleach,"I'm going to start off by saying that I have not finished this anime yet. I am up to episode 178 (I believe), however, from what I've seen so far I know I can give this show a five star rating. Long story short, I always thought shows like Bleach and Naruto were overrated and just way too popular for what they are. In some ways, I still think they are, but in others, I disagree.This anime really caught my attention after Ichigo gained his substitute soul reaper powers and Rukia was sort of like his teacher. I love the drive that Ichigo has to do anything. He doesn't seem to give up no matter what! I love the character chemistry and bantering between him and Rukia, it's funny to say the least. This show constantly has fights and action and there are plenty upon plenty of plot twists. I especially love the characters in this show, because each and every one of them is their own (despite there being 13 guard squads in the Soul Society). Every Soul Reaper seems to have their own distinct powers and uses with their swords, which keeps the show interesting and fresh. I also enjoy the inclusion of the Quincy powers and Ichigo's friends having powers (though I'm not very fond of Orihime). They all have their own personalities too, which is nice. This show has humor, drama and intense action. I can say the only thing I haven't liked so much has been the filler plots and twists that just didn't do anything for me. After watching quite a few episodes, I can also say that the first three seasons were pretty much my favorite. Watching Ichigo go through all the fights with the Squad leaders was by far more interesting than where I am at now in the show. I enjoyed seeing Ichigo grow as a person but also as a Soul Reaper, and I think it's interesting that he is also part hollow. The show tends to have deep stories and rich visuals as well as entertaining characters which is always a plus. I think after watching this show for a while now, it's hard to see any reason why someone wouldn't like Bleach.",4.5
bleach,"This anime's part of the big three that's being serialized in Weekly Shounen Jump. The reason why this has a 4-star rating is due to the filler arcs it has-the Bout arc, the Shusuke Amagai arc (my favorite of the filler arcs), the Zanpaku-to rebellion arc, and the the Regiai arc. Other than that, the plot is good and Aizen as the villian for most of the series (SPOILERS!!) is actually a pretty good villian (in my opinion). If you like intense action scenes (mainly with Ichigo) and good character development (not the best anime with character development), then you'll enjoy this anime. If you want more after watching all 366 episodes, then go read the manga, since it'll be a few years before the anime continues.",4.5
bleach,"I fell in love with this series from the very beginning when it first came out. A few of the seasons are slow, and some of the fillers are rather annoying and don't really contribute much to the story, but all of that aside this is one of my favorite series! I personally have recommended this series to many friends of mine, and so far they are all really loving the storyline. Its action packed, yet not always serious at the same time which makes a perfect blend in my opinion. A highly recommended series.",4.5
bleach,"I underatand most of the bleach fans are mad or happy that its been a long running anime but i feel it has a great deal of interesting parts. As i go throw the interent i see things like ""bleach is to long!, those filler arcs are boring!!!"" but i understand why there saying this. as a fan from the beginning TIte Kubo can`t give me a reason to hate this anime it has many interesting plots so many people can enjoy it and it doesn`t let you down with action and nervousness hoping the characters are going to all right.

oresuki-are-you-the-only-one-who-loves-me,Going into a new anime like this one can honestly make me just feel meh. Starts off so generic its hard to watch for more than a few minutes. And until 9 episodes were out I wasn't able to. The first episode is just so dang slow at first it hurts.Then the actual show starts. At first bench I thought ok finally something is happening. A bench later it got amusing. The next bench made me laugh. The following bench killed me.I was entertained immensely. Its funny. The jokes aren't insanely immature like a lot of harems. Power through the first part of the first episode and you'll be fine. Oh and this is a harem. Just not your typical one. It does a little of everything. Probably the only anime I've ever laughed at 4th wall breaks. If you need some comedy give it a shot.,4
oresuki-are-you-the-only-one-who-loves-me,"This anime is so much more than the troupes it looks like from the cover picture. It has you going back and forth as the audience and it is an adorably hilarious rom com. Understanding the meaning of Jekyll and Hyde might also help with understanding the references they use sometimes. I get excited to see this one each week and I hope it continues to live up to the fun it has brought so far!edit: It does keep getting more cliché as it goes on, but I think it's fun and I still watch every week! And my bf and I definitely have couples that we are rooting for haha.",5
oresuki-are-you-the-only-one-who-loves-me,"I say this series is so good! Know why? Well let me tell u, it has excellent characters! It is pretty funny. Also this series moves at a comfortable pace, I'd like to say. When new series start their run, a lot of info is placed in the 1st episode, which can be a tad overwhelming. But not this series, by the first 3 episodes u have a good understanding as to what's going on. It allows for a really fun romantic comedy :). So check it out",5
oresuki-are-you-the-only-one-who-loves-me,"I'm writing this as the 4th episode has just released, but I've only watched up to ep3. I gotta say I really like the way this story keeps shifting around as the protagonists personality and life unfolds before you to make sure you truly know who he is. This goes for all the other characters as well, they all have their own unique personalities and it makes the story very interesting seeing those personalities clash.",5
oresuki-are-you-the-only-one-who-loves-me,"Okay so you know a show has potential when someone decides to create an account just so they can write a review on it. I felt compelled to do so after reading some of the reviews and here is the rundown. Someone rated this show two stars because they found it to be generic and sort of a cut and paste type show. Im sorry but they clearly did not understand the context nor direction the show was shooting for. It's not supposed to be Toradora or Golden time. It's not trying to be a serious rom-com. So if you are looking for something more melodramatic then yes I do recommend those but the show is clearly poking fun at rom-coms in the most genius and hilarious way. I guarantee you are going to laugh. So with that in mind lets get to it:ANIMATION: Okay not gonna lie. The animation and artstyle is nothing to gawk at. Its pretty generic and has nothing that really helps it to stand out as a series. However the series makes up for this in other ways.CHARACTERS: Look I know the person below said that everyone seems like they were cut and paste from a template BUT THATS THE POINT! And I'll just tell you this much. Not everyone is as they seem.  But don't take my word for it. Go watch. In the end there are two specific characters that helps this show do a complete one eighty and at a certain point you will find yourself smiling and laughing a lot more. STORY: So the story is that a guy is asked out on a date by both the energetic youthful childhood best friend and the beautiful student council president. Both atypical roles that you tend to find in a lot AND I MEAN ALOT of rom coms. And our protagonist is horrified to find that not only do neither of these girls actually love him but the whole point in them asking him out in the first place was to ask for his help in getting together with his other best friend, Sun-chan. To make matters worse, when he does finally get the confession he's always wanted its from the bespectacled, sharp-tongued, stalker girl. Honestly when I first watched the PV I was incredibly intrigued by stalker girl. She actually comes off more authentic (imo) than the other two girls. To some, that synopsis might not be intriguing enough but I highly recommend watching because there is more to this story. I'll say it in three words: I Love Joro.CONCLUSION: The artstyle isn't top notch nor unique and you might be a little turned off in the beginning because everyone is just soooo generic but once you make it to a certain part of the episode there is a bit of a shift and you will realize that you've suddenly stumbled upon something that holds a lot of potential. I definitely wasn't expecting the twist. Is it perfect? No. But if you are looking for a romantic comedy that goes against the grain, has an interesting plot, and makes you laugh. Highly recommend this.",5
oresuki-are-you-the-only-one-who-loves-me,"Imagine a typical Rom-com with the same old ""I have no life or interests"" main character we can all relate to. That's everything you see in first place but after an episode or two all the things that make it unique and great start.Things like making great rolling jokes, self awareness of the characters, and as the cherry at the top the final episode combines two things that I thought were uncombinable. Well done ending and the ""we're back at the beginning see you in the next season“ ending.Some of you that survived my poor and awkward grammar and read it to this point may think "" so why you say it's the best of this year only? "". That's just because I have really bad memory and I could watch something better in the past, but wouldn't I remember it if it was so good?... Anyway I highly recommend it and can't wait for second season. Wow. This was long.",5
oresuki-are-you-the-only-one-who-loves-me,"This is a fun show to watch, but it's too... unrealistic for me. Now I know this is anime so that should be obvious, but any good story has things a viewer can relate to. For example, I loved Rascal ... Bunny Senpai, which on the surface is way extremely more unrealistic than this one. But at its core, Bunny Senpai dealt with the insecurities of adolescence, something everyone in the world can relate to. Oresuki has a touch of that, but is way overshadowed by the silly harem antics and the protagonist's obsession with being recognized as a protagonist. Rarely, it has glimmers of hope thanks to Pansy and her perceptiveness. Besides her though, this show is actually pretty hopeless.",5
oresuki-are-you-the-only-one-who-loves-me,"First off, I am not really into this genre of anime.  However, the writing and humor had me hooked in the first episode! The running gag with the bench had me in chocking on my water (especially with the Vader reference). The “singularity” joke was getting a little old, but it was still funny. I love how they break the 4th wall often! I didn’t expect for Pansy to totally steal the show, but her character had my attention from her intro. Sorry, but I love geeky women.  As the show progresses she comes out of her shell more and more and by the end of the series, she has become a big part of the group.  I was a little unsure if I could trust her since was pretty manipulative, but I got over it.  Let’s be real, if Pansy told me she loved me, this would’ve been a single episode anime.  They better be working on season 2!",5
oresuki-are-you-the-only-one-who-loves-me,"I don't really mind the tropes and ""predictably"" of most shows in the romantic, comedy, etc genre. They're fun, relaxing, and simple, they do what they're supposed to. Oresuki has the charm and fun of the others, but adds a level of sadism and meta humor to the mix. The characters and animation are beautiful and expressive, and it's a great show to watch if you are bored of the genre, or have a friend who is. Definitely worth your time.",5
oresuki-are-you-the-only-one-who-loves-me,"This is a great series to watch. I love it so much. Incredibly hilarious,  and completely ridiculous, and I couldn't stop watching! If you love harem anime, then this is definitely a series you don't want to miss. I don't want to spoil anything, so I'm not going to say anything at all about the characters or the plot. I will say though, that the stoy arc of this anime is great I really hope we get a 2nd season, I really think it deserves to!",5
oresuki-are-you-the-only-one-who-loves-me,"Amatsuyu Kisaragi, who goes by Joro, is just your average high school student. Nothing special, aside from two of his female friends in high school. The first is his cute playful childhood friend Aoi Hinata, also known as Himawari. The second is the beautiful student council president Sakura Akino, also known as Cosmos. During one week, both ask Joro to go on a date with him, Cosmos on Saturday, and Himawari on Sunday. On his date with Cosmos she suddenly confesses her love! Not for him though, but for his friend Taiyou Ooga, known as Sun-chan, the baseball team's ace. Cosmos asks Joro to help her get Sun-chan's attention, sad for Joro, but thankfully he still has his date with Himawari the next day. No, wait, Himawari ends up asking the same exact thing. Okay, let's start this again from the beginning.Amatsuyu Kisaragi, who goes by Joro, is a high school incel, now hellbent to help both of his female friends to try and date his best friend, expecting the loser to crawl into his arms. Although his plans are in grave danger when Sumireko Sanshokuin, who he refers to as Pansy reveals to him she knows what he's up to. How you may ask? She is his stalker, and is truly the only one who loves him.Oresuki is a fine example of character depth, and a great comedy about high schoolers and their seemingly petty conflicts. Every character in Oresuki has clearly defined motivations, and its those motivations that cause the positive or negative responses that push the cast forward as people. Joro and everyone else's actions reveal the type of person they are, but it is because of their shitty behavior that they are able to grow closer, not in spite of it. Because of that, the anime feels a lot more relatable to true friends in real life. Myself and many friends of mine all agree Oresuki's writing is fantastic, and I can strongly recommend it as one of 2019's must watch anime. The art is pretty and compliments the girls to make them even cuter, every personality is believable, and a harem relationship dynamic that's built from the ground up! There is plenty to laugh at, too much to pity, and even something to tear up about. As much as I want to talk more about it, you'll just have to take my word for it and watch it yourself, it's just that good!To those curious, I can highly recommend Oresuki. To those who already finished it, I bet you are anticipating it's finale next year in the summer just as much as I am!",5
oresuki-are-you-the-only-one-who-loves-me,"It's been said already, but I was dubious about this show at first glance. However I was hooked from the first moment the mind-boggling bench was introduced. Throw in a healthy mix of outrageous 4th wall breaks, running gags(bench-kun), and a curveball at literally every freakin' corner and you have quite possibly one of the best if not the best, romcoms of all time and certainly of this year. My only regret is that it seems like there only be one more chance to savor this masterful mix one more time in the form of an OVA sometime next year. I absolutely love Oresuki.I'm not a reviewer tho.",5
oresuki-are-you-the-only-one-who-loves-me,"I don't even know where to start. I love the art style, it makes the girls look attractive unlike ""we never learn Bokuben""' which gives its characters a plain generic look. The plot is excellent. It always leaves you wondering, and thinking with its cliffhangers and crazy twists. The MC is amazing. He's got that Harem vision and can call a bitch, a bitch. This show knows how to pull the emotion strings. I keep getting flashbacks of my old highschool relationships and drama, and those old feelings just make this show even more relatable. I love Pansy and her character's use. Somehow everything always works in her favor and she's 3 steps ahead. And there are many things about her that I'm interested in regarding her backstory. I love their use of Symbolism. Sun-chan is the Sun, and all the girls are always looking to him. Joro means Water pot. And he's always helping each girl grow and learn. One thing a good show always has is a cliffhanger, or a unpredictable plot. Oresuki will send you to the moon and even to a bench.",5
oresuki-are-you-the-only-one-who-loves-me,"I normally hate shows like this. but... it adds enough to it and flips EVERYTHING on it's head and removes the cookie cutter ways people work in anime. everyone is not 1 dimensional they have multiple aspects to themselves. the Mc for example will acts like a nice guy but he has a Hyde style to him and inside his head he acts like a lot of guys, (me included at times sadly) a total prick. i love that about this series. everyone is completely messed up in some way or another. pansy is a bit of a sadist and loves the MC for it. his best friend and student council members use him to get to sun-chan. he helps them to get in the one that loses pants. sun-chan a lot of people hate but, if you have ever been cornered and said stuff just to get a reaction, just to get them to back down. that's what he does to pansy. least that's how i read it. and that is a VERY HUMAN reaction. I highly recommend this show and it might be the best show for fall 2019. next to cautious hero anyway.bench-kun is antagonist of the year!",5
oresuki-are-you-the-only-one-who-loves-me,"I had a slightly marred experience with this title at first simply because of the crunchyroll app video player not working with me despite everything else. However, I had a second chance to watch this as it is currently, I am only at episode 6. That being said, this show is amazingly easy to get into once you're in the setting. It was naturally hard to like the main character at first, simply because of what was learned of his personality. In fact I'd say it was bordering on Incel levels of cringe. However that was only the surface level impressions gained. Looking at how the story is written, and the scenes how well drawn they are, it wasn't hard to start to notice better parts of a character you could actually relate to. While rough around the edges, a steadfast loyalty to ones friends, even knowing the potential consequences; and seeing each of the other characters go from shallow, one dimensional beings to more realized and likable people. Very quickly each became their own people, flaws, quirks, and all.As an anime I never once found myself bored, it wasn't hard to see the symbolism behind the various hints the show throws, but it didn't need to be. Sometimes it is overt, and yes there is a bit of the typical pandering, but never after the initial episode did it feel intrusive. If anything it just helped cement what kind of person the main character is, being a bit delusional if anything. Every scene was paced well, all shots presented with purpose or underlying tone. The music accompanied while on the nose, never felt bothersome. Some scenes lacked punch, but those were few and far in-between, it even goes as far as to reference such lacking of its own accord.This anime is not perfect, doubtfully many are, but it makes it very easy to love because of it. The story treats its viewer with an intellect that is not needed, but if it is there, is easy to go and appreciate. It never messes around with it's own pace, and dispenses little details that go beyond the norm in anime. Above all, I can't wait to see how well the remainder of this show goes, and that should say it all along with the title.",4
oresuki-are-you-the-only-one-who-loves-me,"So, memes regarding a certain piece of dark manga aside, this show is actually pretty good. As a comedy, the jokes land squarely, almost especially the ones that have repetition. What's a harem protagonist to do when the cute girls...all actually want to date his best friend? The characters are amusing, but everyone is also a terrible human being in their own way. Definitely would recommend as a seasonal anime. If you like harems, but would prefer something a little different, Oresuki is an excellent choice this fall.",5
oresuki-are-you-the-only-one-who-loves-me,"This show goes from being one of the best things I've ever watched to umm... Wat.Our Protag Joro is not an innocent ""Im average and I get all the girls"" Hes two faced perverted and overall a huge jerk in my opinion. Which is good a fresh start for once... But this guy apparently has a nice heart and good intentions said by the prettiest girl in the school who covers herself and binds her tities. The one who likes him is her because the girls he wanted to get with like his equally jerky bestfriend. He tries to help them it fails because the girl that his best friend wants is the the girl he supposedly calls ugly even though she is actually the prettiest girl in the school(Only Best Friend kun Knows). Best friend kun sets up Joro and he set is the outcast. Girl he hates and calls ugly helps him resolve the whole problem. But then JORO has to apologize to them after they used him and made him an outcast????! Its Outrageous that he still wants to be friends, they didn't do anything to deserve that friendship again. Once he shows his true nature he does something totally out of character. He still calls the Pretty girl ugly insisting he could never date her with her personality but calls those other girls bitches which they totally were but, still would date them. She has a way better personality than them. But then again protag just wants to get in a pretty girls panta. Basically the protag is fake and everyone is fake. So this is a fucked up romance comedy that shows the audience just how fake the characters are. It's really good but if you can't stand fake characters I wouldn't watch it.",5
oresuki-are-you-the-only-one-who-loves-me,"So this series was a wild card for me so far. I like to pick random anime to watch at times and took a risk.The cover of the series made me questionable, I thought that this show would be just another cheesy slice of life.Nope.This series so far, just 3 episodes in have been very fun to watch for me at least. Episode two is a wildcard in my opinion,but a wildcard im so grateful for viewing. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys a certain level of humor, seriousness, emotion and mystery. Most anime dont leave me guessing the next outcome or plot. Most series I watch just leave me feeling bland or refreshed, no inbetween. This series so far has given me a new refreshing and original vibe. Id recommend this for anyone who hasnt entered into the world of Slice of Life.",5
oresuki-are-you-the-only-one-who-loves-me,"I would give it closer to 4.5 stars but I think its that good that i lean more towards a 5, among all the other sea of isekai coming out 2019, this anime is a funny drama about a boy and a love shape thing that I wont spoil for reasons. Its fairly relatable and extremely funny when it comes to the plot, its a very fun watch that i searched and read the entire manga and now considering buying my first light novel series.

After being asked to go on a date with them, they both confess to liking Joro's best friend, Sun-chan. When I realized this, I just awed. It's a new take on the worthless Harem genre.

Although the main concept itself is not exactly original, the use of that concept is quite refreshing in this anime. In an era of ""Crappy Isekai Invensted"" anime industry, this kind of series is greatly welcomed.",5
oresuki-are-you-the-only-one-who-loves-me,"A high school romcom (sort of) in love with satirical romance. All signs point to this being a bold comedy, so don't hold your breath on expectations of heart throbbing romance that will make you fangirl out loud. It's a highly generic setup in many ways, but that doesn't mean it isn't something special. If I had to say something bad about OreSuki it would be the characters. Though they play out well in scenes, many characters lack depth and can feel highly generic to the point that they remind you of every other romcom out there. There are a few favorites, but many feel like cookies on a baking sheet, only a select few feel irreplaceable. Voice acting has a few stars and some bland performances. It's hard to tell if this is a result of the lines themselves or purely talent so far. If I had to say something good about OreSuki it would easily be the art. A vibrant, colorful setting has a delightful use of color schemes you might only rarely see in any genre of anime. Beautiful art adorns backgrounds and characters alike that make anything and everything the screen shows pleasing to the eye. Excellent attention to detail to all aspects of the visuals down to the little accessories. Comedy is a sticking point in the show, with clever writing that delivers with great consistency. The soundtracks are masterfully used. Though they might seem very ordinary and bland on their own, the use and timing of tracks is effective and adds impact consistently across diverse scenes. Animation is well done.Overall it's a comedy intent on showing the horrors of young love, an anti-harem if you want to define the genre. There isn't much the show has to offer outside of comedy and nice visuals. It does fall short of being truly great, but scenes are delivered with excellence again and again, unexpectedly turning what seems like a generic show into a moderate success. I give it a 7.8/10. Favorite character: Bench-kun.TLDR Version: Anti-romcom with stunning visuals. Not perfect, but very consistent. Cast is very weak. Repetitive but fun, for now.",5
oresuki-are-you-the-only-one-who-loves-me,"As of writing this I have seen episode 2 and no further. I have also not interacted with this story in any other medium so I know diddly squat about where this is going to go. First off, I absolutely love the MC and his inner monologue. It’s hilarious and completely contradicts the nice guy attitude everyone else sees. The girls representing flowers and the popular guy being named “sun” is unique and fresh, I really like it. The rule of three in comedy is also present and frequently shows up (aka the bench and confession scenes) and having people lay out their feelings at the first episode of the show therefore avoiding the “keep it in nobody shall know” attitude that these kinds of shows tend to lean towards is enough to keep me watching. If you’re on the fence, give it a shot. I know I’ll be sticking with this one.Review will be updated at the end of the season.",5
oresuki-are-you-the-only-one-who-loves-me,"I like this anime, because the main character is not the bland character you meet in the first minute (no spoiler).  I also like how he gets himself pretty deep in trouble even within the first two episodes... I'm looking forward to how deep in crap he gets, and how he gets himself out of it, or what happens in the end.I've watched to the end of the 2nd episode, and it ended on a huge cliffhanger.

oresuki-are-you-the-only-one-who-loves-me,"This anime may be one of the smartest takes on a classic harem anime I've seen in a while. It does a great job of both refining the common slice of life romance while also expertly subverting those. Story 4/5: You have your generic male protagonist that looks exactly like Kirito from Sword Art Online. In his harem, the childhood friend, the student council president, the bookish girl, the journalist, the tsundere, and then a random girl who just got introduced so I don't know what trope she is yet. BUT, it starts off with the student council president and the childhood friend having a crush on this guy's best friend instead of him. And then the bookish girl turns out to actually be stalking the MC. The basic plot is the same as any other harem anime but where it gets good is in how the characters subvert the traditional archetypes they portray.Characters 4/5: The characters here are what make this anime actually interesting. Moreover, the MC isn't the impossibly dense harem protagonist we've all become accustom to. He's actually a conniving manipulative main character who beneath his layer of selfishness actually has a heart of gold. The bookish girl is similarly intelligent and manipulative and she's also ridiculously hot. The student council president is incredibly awkward and speaks like a samurai whenever she is flustered but is also intelligent and able to see through people instantly. This is what a harem anime looks like if people aren't idiots.Art/Animation 3/5: Pretty well animated. The girls are cute. THE BENCHES. The benches are OMINOUS. There's nothing amazing about the animation, but it is pretty standard and there's nothing to complain about.Sound 3/5: The sound works well with the anime. It can switch from a light-hearted tone to something ominous in a drop of a hat which also fits the comedic theme really well. OP is very skippable, the typical upbeat intro song. ED is pretty solid, but nothing to write home about.Enjoyment 5/5: This anime is hilarious. It does a great job of subverting the tropes and at the same time tells a compelling narrative filled with betrayal, manipulation, and hidden agendas. Characters are actually intelligent not stupidly dense. The characters aren't aloof and clueless as they typically would be and that is rare enough and an interesting enough that it got me hooked. Overall: Solid anime, great take on the usual slice of life harem. It's absolutely hilarious. I probably wouldn't recommend this for a first time anime viewer, but if you're familiar with how these stories usually go, the ways that this anime takes it in a different direction are refreshing take and well worth the watch.",5
oresuki-are-you-the-only-one-who-loves-me,"This comedy starts out slow, but it is very similar to My Teen Romantic Comedy Snafu. At the beginning I missed why Joro is mean to Pansy, but I rewatched her introduction sequence and I got it. She was especially rude to him at all times, maybe trying to coax out his Mr. Hyde. But later, her feelings for him get in the way, his frank side has fangs and venom she wasn't ready for. It made me feel bad for her, but I guess she really did get to him with her insults in the past, we weren't shown those.That's the relationship I'm least confused about, we have an obsessive girl who has become a pain in the neck, and a guy who's fed up with being nice. The rest seems to be done for laughs or to set up the comedy. The confessions seem to have been simply for the gag to happen.The panty shots seem to be out of place. Nothing wrong with a bit of fs, but why? Anyway. The art is nice, I like this style and I even search out shows which use it. The music is in the show, I didn't notice quality or lack there of. The comedy is nice, some people have more sensitive funny bone than I, reading the reviews it seems some were absolutely tickled pink; I laughed. Sometimes. The samurai bit got me.All in all I can't give it 5 stars in its genre, or as an overall with Demon Slayer out there. DS seriously rose the bar for quality, and I don't think this show comes close. In the food industry 5 stars use to mean something, now it means the restaurant has cloth napkins and you get to sit and eat, I don't want that to happen to Anime. This is a standard summer comedy with panty shots and outlandish situations, watch and enjoy, but let's not pretend this is a blockbuster please.",5
oresuki-are-you-the-only-one-who-loves-me,"You can be forgiven for thinking that this looks like another romantic comedy or harem anime. In fact, it is that, but it gets dark, fast, as our protagonist's dark side is revealed. The good news is that he has a capable, and apparently just as dark, nemesis. And so the first episode sets the stage for what could be one of the best anime of the year.I'm not gonna lie: if you identify with the protagonist by the end of the first episode, then you probably need some help with your anger and/or entitlement issues. Don't let that stop you from enjoying this journey of the antihero.",5

This series is a GIANT cringe-fest for anyone who does not measure their success in life by the standards of female acceptance.  Good riddance.",5

This anime should all be in your top 10 list just by the virtue of the first episode alone. This anime is the Shakespeare of modern times. Just watching this anime I can sense the Aristotelian aura that radiates from this anime. This anime will save anime as a whole just like how Aristotle's influence brought us out of the dark ages. It will revolutionize anime as we know it. Anyone who rates this under 5 stars is an idiot and we should all flag their posts. Edit: This anime is officially trash. The next episode after his ""best"" friend tries to destroy his relationships with everybody he knows out of envy he tries to be befriend when he has done nothing to redeem himself besides admit what he did. He didn't even apologize directly to the MC and him admitting it blatantly is so unrealistic and does not understand the motive behind people acting immorally. In every criminal's mind, they try to justify their actions as an act against the people who wronged them. If you want a full comprehension on this check out Lenoard Peikoff's lecture on what to do about crime. The first 2 episodes where good but this anime keeps getting worse and worse and I can not continue to consume this garbage. Minds that change especially ones of moral degenerates who act of spite and try to destroy everything the MC has built out of spite.",5
oresuki-are-you-the-only-one-who-loves-me,"So its not your typical meme-y harem, but that doesn't make it better. They introduce the protagonist Joro as a manipulative ""every-guy"" who figures that at least one of his two love interests will get rejected if he feigns matchmaker. He's slimey. In the end it turns out Joro was the one being manipulated and Pansy played all the players who were all out to humiliate Joro. Except if Pansy is so good, why didn't she ask Joro out earlier? Or put him in a spot where he wanted to ask Pansy out? And the further you pull on the threads the less these characters make sense. There are too many 'whose the real victim' twists and not a lot of real characters.",5
dragon-ball-super,"I was just an five year old boy when I first had the pleasure of witnessing Dragon Ball on TV. Though I was perhaps too young to understand it, the image of Son Goku's distinct spiky yet relaxed black hair and infectious smile was ingrained into my brain forever. As I got older, I'd eventually move onto Dragon Ball Z at the age of eight after reading the first manga volume in the library of my Intermediate School classroom. The more I'd aged, the more I grew to love Dragon Ball. I was hooked, and my knowledge of the series was immense: Dragon Ball. The dreaded GT. Toriyama's Interviews. Daizenshuu. The movies. Everything and more. This isn't going to be a long review about my history with the series, but I include it so that the thesis of this review gets through:Dragon Ball Super is the sequel to DBZ we have been waiting for. It breathes new life into the franchise and is quintessential Dragon Ball. Elements from Dragon Ball Z as well as the original Dragon Ball seamlessly mesh into this new series. With the addition of new characters, such as Beerus the Destroyer and his charismatic (and-- I might add-- fabulous) attendant Whis. Along the way stronger and stronger foes are met and the stakes are raised to newer heights. Akira Toriyama has proven WHY Dragon Ball works: the characters, story, spectacle and world-building-- all of which are important facets of Dragon Ball Super that are immensely expanded and grown upon. New elements of the world-- such as the Gods-- have been introduced, and it not only makes the Dragon Ball Universe bigger, but gives it far more diversity and makes it far more interesting than previously thought. Even long-time characters like Goku, Vegeta, Piccolo and even Future Trunks are given careful, concise time to be developed. The series is able to inject effective drama and light-hearted, genuinely hilarious comedy into its narrative at the turn of the dime.While the animation can occasionally dip into the inexcusably category (I'm looking at you, Episode 5 and over half of the Golden Frieza arc), the show is never able to dissuade you from watching it. It helps that just about every episode ends on a cliffhanger, but it's more than that. It speaks volumes about the characters and story when, even though we know Goku is going to live since he's still alive during the last chapter of the manga (even though I-- for the record-- think will be series arc) and everything turns out fine, the series can still threaten the audience with the possibility of it all being destroyed. The sense of urgency is still felt, and that's what's most important in a series like this. To those who complain about the fact that we know everything will turn out fine: where have you been? Of course everything will turn out fine, this is a continuation of the definitive SHONEN JUMP manga. Even though, yes, the good guys will ultimately triumph, it is their character and personality that allows us to worry for their well-being. Dragon Ball has always been a series in which each character seemed to have a distinct personality and still fit the tone and world of the series, and Dragon Ball Super expands upon that. It's genuinely one of my favorite current Anime and I'd highly recommend it-- ESPECIALLY for Dragon Ball fans!",4.5
dragon-ball-super,Ever since Super aired in Japan in July 2015 Ive been watching every episode a day after it aired in Japan with English subs from random sites because they never had a Legal legit source. Now that Crunchyroll is gonna be subbing Dragonball Super episodes and get them on here AN HOUR AFTER AIR TIME IN JAPAN. Holy shit thats amazing I personally unsubscribed because Fairytail ended but now I got another show + Naruto to watch and more on this amazing site THANK YOU FOR FINALLY GETTING DRAGONBALL SUPER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,5
dragon-ball-super,"I've watched most of DB, re-watched DBZ numerous times, GT a few times and don't specifically hate on it like many fans, and have now been following DBS...I knew going in, that it wasn't going to be a new DBZ, the style / humor / pacing / animation etc. would all be different.And while it took me a while to get used to the new animation style, I thought the show started strong in terms of story and to a lesser degree character development, but the recent arch and episodes is starting to get boring.I know that the DBZ power scale went out the window long time ago, but one important side effect of this is that for those of us who grew up with DBZ there's no longer any stakes in the fights. When you start the series with such a high power level that it was a danger to the existence of the universe, while episodes later, they're struggling against foes that make potholes with attacks that should destroy the planet, there is no investment into the characters anymore.",5
dragon-ball-super,"Dragon Ball Super was a huge disappointment for me, I love both DB and DBZ but when it comes to Super I just see it as another excuse for Toei to make money out of Dragon Ball once again. The characters are dumb, all of them. Even at times where you would think that the characters would take it seriously, they don't.There are no stakes, like... never, all of the plots or arcs are extremely predictable and the characters don't grow in any way, shape or form. Though if we are talking about power-ups God they have a lot of those. The series way of saying that a character grew is by Power-Ups, that they get by doing ... a lot of training? Losing a fight? NOPE, they get them because PLOT NEEDS FIGHT TO ENTERTAIN AUDIENCE. Talking about fights, the overall animation is MEDIOCRE. Yes, they improved just a bit in the newest episodes but it is still godawful compared to the much superior animation from DB and DBZ (even DBGT). They overuse still images and reuse the same scene more than twice in one episode. For some reason, the director had the brilliant idea of using Long Shots, leading to disfigured and disproportional drawings. There is also they ugly filter used in the last arc that made things even worse. DB Super is for the fans who just want to see Goku, Vegeta, and Freeza on screen once again. If you are looking for an actual plot with developing characters, moments of seriousness, stakes and an actual development of a narrative then DB Super is not for you. One Piece, Naruto, Bleach, and DBZ are all far better shows that deserve their fame, Super is just another cash grab just like GT.",5
dragon-ball-super,"Nostalgia. It's an incredibly powerful tool used to engage viewers and fans. For Dragon Ball, it offers a wonderful sense of nostalgia, growing up with Toonami  and classic anime like Sailor Moon. In that respect I'm almost more fond of the dub and it's wonderful throwbacks and appreciation for those early 90's dubs.Super is a difficult beast to review, it's still ongoing and whether or not it succeeds depends greatly on the fan and their perspective when watching. If this is your introduction to Dragon Ball then you'll find plenty of engaging moments, but also unnecessary filler and exposition. And, frankly at this point, even the casual anime fan is familiar with the tropes and pitfalls that have befallen every iteration of this iconic series. The question is if you're comfortable with that. I imagine that largely depends on the awareness and nostalgic grip the franchise has on you.It would be insulting to review this series without acknowledging its impact on Western audiences, and comparison is unavoidable. While I feel Super has yet to reach the heights of its predecessors, I also admit it would have been difficult to live up to years of expectation. Nostalgia can be greedy that way.The action is over the top and visceral, while the characters are exactly what we've come to expect. It's like coming home again. And there's nothing wrong with a reunion, you just don't want to overstay your welcome.",5
dragon-ball-super,"Dragon Ball is one of the all time classics of shonen anime and manga, and Dragon Ball Super, the latest addition to the franchise is no exception. However, it's worth noting that the first two arcs of this new series are watered down remakes of the films ""Battle of Gods"" and ""Resurrection 'F'"".I would suggest watching this new series in the following manner:Episodes 1-2, Battle of Gods film, episodes 15-18, Resurrection 'F' film, episodes 28+(Feel free to watch the Resurrection 'F' arc in the show as it does add a few interesting extra details, but the TV version of Battle of Gods pales in comparison to the director's cut of the film.)I'd also recommend watching the previous installments in the series, Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z (or Dragon Ball Z Kai, the filler free cut of DBZ), prior to this series if you haven't already seen them. (Although most people probably have by now, right?)",3
dragon-ball-super,"One of the greatest Anime series of ALL TIME. Picks up after Dragon Ball Z and invalidates the terrible Dragon Ball GT. Best action comedy anime of our lifetimes! All of the old DBZ characters are there but only Goku and Vegeta are relevant so far. The rest are more fan service than anything. Follow the story of Goku and Vegeta becoming gods, travelling through time, exploring the universe, and more. Very silly but compelling story. A true homage to the glory of DBZ.",5
dragon-ball-super,"It's exciting to hear Dragon Ball Super is officially getting subbed. They, also, created a department specifically for Dragon Ball, which is where they will brain storm new ideas for Dragon Ball Super, so it must be getting big. With many big anime shows out of the way, like Naruto, no surprise there. Looking forward to hearing more news on Dragon Ball Super. Maybe uploading the chapters of Dragon Ball Super is next. I'm sure it could be if the anime garners attention on here.",2
dragon-ball-super,"Don't get me wrong. I'm one of the biggest DBZ fans you could ever find. I was jumping with excitement when I heard the series was going to continue where it left off after the Buu saga. (I REALLY did not like Dragonball GT)DBZ is known for it's fast action, crazy power ceilings, and hyper masculine screaming to reach new pinnacles of strength. It's not known for having much thought behind the process of it. We gave it a pass when we were younger. But as we've grown older, we've expected some degree of finesse to be added to the story. The franchise's biggest fans are all adults now, of course. But the series began to disappoint me. The fighting animation didn't look as clean compared to DBZ. Some things just went off to where I didn't expect them to go, and in a bad way. New power ups beyond SS3, which already seemed godly in DBZ, is now just an afterthought in DBS. Future Trunks' saga, which I was really looking forward to, was marred by a lackluster villain and quite literal deus ex machina. And of course, a tournament supposedly timed under an hour is stretched out through SEVERAL episodes, revealing another badly paced production by Toei. I'm still watching the show. But at the moment, it feels like I'm watching it more out of homage as a DBZ fan instead of enjoying the show as it is. And as it is, it is a subpar show that takes too many creative liberties that it makes even a crazy, off the wall anime like DBZ seem ludicrous. I think Toriyama and Toei would benefit more from having a 13-26 episode production like more recent shows, as well as some editors to keep them grounded.",3
dragon-ball-super,"Dragon Ball has always been an extremely influential franchise, but after the Cell Saga in Dragon Ball Z, there really hasn't been a 'great' arc to really get behind and say 'yea, this anime is awesome'.In many ways, Dragon Ball Super is a good anime. Of the arcs within it I personally liked the Future Trunks/Zamatsu Saga and the Universal 6 Saga (in order of the two arcs I liked the most); they weren't perfect mind you, but they were good. However, the other arcs were a bit.... meh. Battle of the Gods and Golden Frieza each had movies covering their arcs so if you watched them, the anime arcs were a downgrade - not necessarily bad if you didn't watch the movies but a rehash if you did. Copy-Vegeta Saga didn't really offer anything new really - I would have rather had Trunks and Goten go off on some adventure and actually show some growth. The last one, The Universal Survival Saga, was ultimately a let down for me, and part of the reason I give this a 3 star review. The main antagonist, Jiren, was essentially Broly all over again (not the new Broly Saga, the older non-canon one) in that he wasn't interesting. I don't think he was necessarily a bad character to have but I don't think he should have been what the series ended with.Heck, Toppo was more interesting to me, and it likely would have been better to have Jiren get knocked out. One could even level the playing field so to speak by having Vegeta and Goku be eliminated with Jiren - Frieza was still around and I don't think anyone would mind seeing some character development done with him.Overall I'll end this by saying that if you were interested in Dragon Ball Z, Super is worth checking out. Ignore it though perhaps if you weren't interested in Dragon Balls though.",5
dragon-ball-super,"Love all DragonBall content. Super has yet to let me down looking forward to the new arch.Only thing I'm really hoping for is more of Gohan, Trunks, and Goten.As far as why you should watch it all the way through, it has everything you loved about DragonBall z. With more of the DragonBall world or world's to be more exact unfolding  in these new sagas. With returning favorites. The tournament of power really keeps you wanting more.",5
dragon-ball-super,"The story is often far-fetched with lots of cliches. Power levels are as b******t as they've been throughout the entirety of DBZ. The stakes get so high they become meaningless in the end. The supporting cast is pretty much useless throughout 90% of the series. It's not like there could be any non-godly threats to Earth that Goku and Vegeta wouldn't even bother fighting. Nah, that would require (gasp) character development and (terrified gasp) less screentime for Goku.Characters are mostly likeable or at least passable. The only character I ended up hating with all my strength was Goku. He seems to have lost all his charm and now I just find him obnoxious and dumb. The ""getting a boner everytime someone strong appears"" routine got very stale at this point and is just annoying. I'd so much love to get a mini saga just with the supporting cast kicking some a** for a change instead of having to see Goku get excited for no reason over and over again. Enough is enough!The art is ok most of the time, although I still don't get it how slimming down characters to the point they look almost anorexic (looking at you, Saiyan girls) fits the overall tone of the fighting-oriented story. Too much muscle was bad but too little is just pushing it too far in the opposite direction.Bulma looks like she not only didn't age after the Buu saga but she seems to have regressed to her late twenties/early thirties. It's not particularly bad, just weird. Kinda ruins the cohesiveness of the timeline and overall world building.Future Trunks also comes back with a different hair color and suddenly everyone is like ""yeah, he always looked like that"". Why force such a change when fans clearly remember a different look?Series also includes lots of fanservice: an obligatory Future Trunks saga, Broly (well, kinda), Roshi using the Mafuuba and many more.All in all, it's an enjoyable watch for diehard Dragon Ball fans but not necessarily a great one for everybody else.",4.5
dragon-ball-super,"dis chet right is the best work of anime of ALL time. ya heard? period. dont @ me pls. i grew up watching this chet and let me you something, let me tell you something. i am glad i did. if it wasn't for dbz i dont think the anime community would of been as big as it is today. dbz got me interested enough to watch other anime shows. and gotdam i praise baby jesus i did. but but but... yall really need to tie ""GT"" together. gt was quality.",4.5
dragon-ball-super,"With the end of the show and the upcoming movie in December, catch up and binge on Dragon Ball Super! If you enjoy non-stop action with a sprinkle of comedy Dragon Ball Super is just for you!Dragon Ball is a favorite anime of mine. I cannot express my love for it in a few words, seriously.  SPOILERS If you have watched Dragon Ball Z already, you know that the ending episode cuts to Uub (the reincarnation of Buu) fighting against Goku, now in Dragon Ball Super we see the amazing characters back in actions fighting through enemies between the time frame before Uub has grown up. With the Dub coming along its way, there is not a better time to watch Dragon Ball Super!  WITH THIS NEW REVIEW WILL YOU WATCH DRAGON BALL SUPER? FIND OUT NEXT TIME ON CRUNCHYROLL.COM!",5
dragon-ball-super,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJavs8ZFBqsi honestly hope next series is going to take its lot more serious and takes less of a focus on fan service and being just a Goku Show (Actual character diversity is needed). So, where to start Super starts out with adapting first two movies in TV-format bit more stretched out in actual episodes and mostly not reaching same level as movies, there isn’t any real amazing fights or plot in the first two arcs. The real stuff pretty much starts in the 3rd arc where the universe is expanded and followed by god awful Future Trunks saga.The last Arc Universal Survival Saga is where the good stuff is – even though its just fighting and has little to nothing terms of story & lore. There is some background stories revealed for certain characters and then you obviously know they are gonna get knocked off.Overall super has shit ton of potential but it failed to meet standards of DBZ and thats the real shame here, perhaps toriyama and his crew were aiming a less serious series and more bit of a mixture between original DB & DBZ.",5
dragon-ball-super,"While it is indeed the very same Dragonball we all know and love, it's becoming clear that they're running out of ideas. I mean, Frieza's back for like what, the third time, and they just won't stop creating practically duplicate characters and reusing worn out scenarios. However, I do appreciate the refreshed visuals as compared to Z, and I can definitely get behind the music. But I mean really? I thought SSJ4 from GT was bad, but Super Saiyan Blue? Also I miss DBZ Vegeta, he's too goofy now ;-;",2
dragon-ball-super,"If you enjoyed DBZ before, you will love this one. The enemies are stronger, the abilities more irrational. Goku more oblivious, Vegeta more loveable. It is literally like riding a humour filled, action rollercoaster. The new abilities are cool and our heroes don't seem as invincible as before. Makes you just want to see what insane enemy they are fighting next. Its no Dragon Ball GT, but heck its Great Anime!",3
dragon-ball-super,"I am writing this review in the middle of the fifth story arc aka the Tournament of Power. The beginning is of the series is very slow starting. Essentially a mixture of filler, bad production and the two movies released before super Battle of Gods and Resurrection of F. The series doesn't really pick up till the end of the third story arc and beyond that. The fourth and fifth arcs are very interesting with lots of action and new/interesting characters. Essentially if you have not watched super and have seen the two movies mentioned above skip to Universe 6 tournament arc.",5
dragon-ball-super,"As someone who only recently became a fan of Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball Super is pretty interesting. I haven't seen any of the other Dragon Ball anime, but I've read the Dragon Ball manga and I really enjoyed it. I got the feeling while reading the Buu Saga that Toriyama was getting tired and that there weren't any stakes anymore. This problem of not having any stakes get fixed, eventually. And that is the most important part I want to get at. Dragon Ball Super gets good and finds interesting ways to raise the stakes, but you have to sit through at least one sub par saga. I also really love the new art style because when it's good, it's really good. But there are some moment where the art looks really sloppy. Some animation just looks wrong, but most of the fight scenes look really good with proper weight in every punch, something you can't say for other fighting anime. One big change, or what you could call a return to form, is the characterization of Goku. In Super Goku just wants to fight the strongest people, no matter the cost and with out regard for his own or other peoples life's. In my opinion this is when Goku is the most fun and  the most interesting, not when he a boring hero type, but when he just wants to fight.Is Dragon Ball Super the best anime ever? No. Does it need to be? No. Dragon Ball has always been about being fun as its number one goal and Dragon Ball Super definitely delivers. After some time that is.",4
dragon-ball-super,"Don't get me wrong I love Dragon Ball (Yes I am aware I am using the Term Dragon Ball just to describe  all of Dragon Ball universe not just Super or  Z or GT (lol some will be like wth GT) or the original but anyway) but I think their jumping too fast into arch and rushing passed it tad bit to fast just to progress the story further, its good but feels like little fast. EX: they jumped from point A to multi universe tournament under 100 episodes, but then again they are continuing from Z.",5
dragon-ball-super,"It has been a long time since a TV has made me jump out of my chair in excitement. I'm a grown adult and I found myself on the edge of my seat and audibly cheering. Don't get me wrong, as a fan, it's rough going at first. However, the Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideTournament of Power arc brought me back to the days of my youth. The fights were thrilling. I highly recommend this anime. If you are new the Dragon Ball Saga, honestly, this wouldn't be a bad place to jump in. You'd miss out on a ton of references and some context, but it's still just as thrilling. It's a story with a TON of amazing action. Try it out!",3
dragon-ball-super,"This series is a great watch, It starts off slow mainly because the first 20+ episodes are just retellings of the stories that the movies (Battle of Gods/Resurrection F) told. After that, the series really picks up. The only cons I can give it are that there are some really bad animation moments and its slow to start but other than that its a great watch. I think people who have watched the recent dragon ball z movies will like this series. I highly recommend this show.",5
dragon-ball-super,"Being a huge fan of Dragon ball and Dragon Ball Z, I found this show to be a little disappointing. It still kinda feels like the series I grew up watching as a kid, but not nearly as well written and has even less appealing animation than the shows that were made in the 80's and 90's.The story for the first two arcs I think was done a little better in the movies than it was in the show and the arcs after didn't seem that well written either. So far, the only arc I really liked was the tournament arc between Universe 6 and Universe 7. The show's incredibly slow too, even slower than the original could get. And of course, the animation isn't that great either when you compare it to the movies and the classic animation from the original show.It's not a terrible show, but the main reason why I'm still watching it is because I love the original series. And that's pretty much all I should say about this, I recommend this to Dragon Ball fans only.",4.5
dragon-ball-super,"I’d have to say dragon ball super is mediocre. I love the fight scenes they make up for the lack of great story line. I understand that Dragon Ball has been mostly about fighting, but it’d be fun to see new martial art style's to be included, more in depth story line. I just hate hearing Naruto fans honestly comparing DBZS to that anime. I would just like the writers to come up  with better story lines… IDK maybe train some new humans of earth to help defend the planet … I mean they need to start helping the humans become stronger to…",4.5
dragon-ball-super,"I grew up watching Dragon Ball Z, then late Dragon Ball, and a little of GT.While Super has its flaws I do love the series for its characters. I like seeing how they have changed over time and the new ones are a joy. The show starts off with a re-hash of the last two dragon ball films, while I prefer the Super versions due to the build up and characterization I will admit they do drag on a little longer than I'd have liked. If you have not seen the films yet then you might not have a problem with this. After episode 29 or so, new content for the series comes out and its best described as a mish-mash of classic dragonball flair and Z for the rest of the series. Newcomers should really start with either dragonball of Z but fans of the series as a while will find plenty to love.",5
dragon-ball-super,"Dragonball Super has been written to appeal with both the kids and the grown up fans. The comedy is enjoyable and many throwbacks to old school Dragonball is a delight to see. The little bits of character development are a treat.However, the writing is too childish at times, throwing the limits of the show right out the window. The shiny animation and the lack of blood are also a turn off. We all know what we think of the movie recaps.",5
dragon-ball-super,"Let me begin this review by saying that I've seen and read everything there is about Dragonball, Dragonball Z and even Dragonball GT. I'm also reading the manga for DBChou at the same time that I'm watching the anime and let me tell you that the mange is 10 times better from an art as well as a story point of view.We've all seen the terrible frames of animation shown on the first few episodes, and you can also say that most of the fight scenes are dull and abuse of Ki attacks to make it easier on the animators.But, with all that said, DBChou definitely carries over the same spirit that DBZ had. So much so that you could say that it has the same story all over again. Somebody strong rises up looking for a fight, the good guys lose, they train and acquire new powers, they fight again and good guys win. Rinse and repeat as much as you need...Also the 1st two arcs are the last movies that came out, ""Battle of the Gods"" and ""Resurrection F"" with slightly different story but not enough.If you feel that you need more DBZ in your life, look no further and enjoy the show, but please make yourself a favor and don't look for an amazing story. Just enjoy it for what it is.",3
dragon-ball-super,"I grew up on DBZ, and I found the original DB series to be even more enjoyable. And Dragon Ball Super? Way better than DBZ, in my opinion. DBS takes the characters we love and just has fun with it. The problem with DBZ was the intensely uninteresting fight sequences. Oh, there's a new big bad? And he's going to destroy the earth? And only Goku can save us?  Again? Sigh...I'll just check in every six episodes or so to see if they're done yet. DBS understands this. DBS even pokes fun at this, with Vegeta once commenting on Goku's tendency to never start at full power. If you are not familiar with the characters, I'd probably change my review to 3/5 stars. As is, it's thoroughly enjoyable and not as forcefully serious and tedious as DBZ.",3
dragon-ball-super,"Dragon ball Super is one of my favorite continuations of a story. At first I thought the animation studious had some flaws in Resurrection of F, but after that in the following arcs after Dragon ball super had the most realistic fights.In Dragon Ball Super, my three favorite fights were between Hit and Goku, Vegito and Zamasu, and Goku and Vegeta. In my opinion, these to fights marked the beginning of one great show.",5
dragon-ball-super,"Dragon Ball Super carries the emotion, action, and gorgeous art style that Z had, but adapts to a new audience at the same time. The show is funnier than Z was, which sometimes takes a not from more recent shows and their background gag visual humor, but other times just takes the characters we know and love and shows them struggling to do everyday tasks due to their ridiculous strength/lack of social skills. In some ways, it both keeps up with the times and returns to its Dragon Ball roots, where the show inherently was a parody; Goku, often unintentionally, makes fun of himself and Vegeta quite a bit, much to Vegeta's annoyance. This has nothing to do with anything, but I swear Goku gets dumber every year. Especially in the most recent arcs, we could very easily call this show ""The Chronicles of the Many Fuckups Of Goku."" Anyway, overall 5/5 - this most recent arc is amazing. Watch it before the internet spoils the good stuff!",5
dragon-ball-super,"Dragon Ball Super is a pretty good show...no, it's a great show. The story line is very cool and I am at episode four. I know I'm not far but far it's great can't wait 'till episode 21-46 come in two saturdays. So far Buu and Mr.Satan are my favorite I just love their little moments. They're not main characters but they bring a smile to my face.   I like Vegeta, Bulma, and Kid Trunks's relationship as well but Mr.Satan and Buu take the cake.",4
dragon-ball-super,"Dragonball Z was a guilty pleasure or your first introduction to anime depending on how old you are.  The story was repetitive, but heck, I liked it and I even played the Trading Card Game (ECP if anyone from the regionals circuit reads this)Now though?  Now we get to see Dragonball Z go off script.  This isn't a story designed to let Toriyama pump out a weekly issue.No real filler, how could there be?  Instead, these are just inconsequential comedy arcs that, for all we know, could play a role later on.  The action is just beautiful.  As we've all learned watching DBZ: Abridged, 1996 was 20 years ago and it shows.The storylines are complex.  Like we saw in the two movies, the world is just soooooo much bigger and the show turns DBZ tropes and lore on their ear.  The Tournament Saga is AMAZING.  Vegeta will, and this is not really a spoiler, literally mentor someone he likes very much by viciously describing murdering the other guys family.  It's a small moment, but it shows where the writing has gone.What happens when a character besides goku gets to have sudden inexplicable boosts?  You'll find out.  How about taking a trip to the literal mirror universe?  How about old school dragonball style fights that were more about puzzles than the next powerups?How about a new Trunks saga where in the first episode he splits a can of catfood with a freedom fighter before, shocker, running back in time for Goku's help and an entire episodes plot is like Beerus and Goku as buddy cops and it WORKS.Dragonball was always fun, but now?  Now dragonball is GOOD",5
dragon-ball-super,"The dragon ball series is back and dragon ball super starts off where DBZ ends. A fantastic and light hearted series that expands the dragon ball universe where Goku and friends go on new adventures. If you've been a fan of the dragon ball series and you dreamed of the DBZ series continuing since when you were a kid then look no further, since it is now here!Plenty of classic action, comedy and interactions between many different characters. Expecting great things to come from this series! If you loved dragonball or you are simply looking for lots of action and some comedy with a sprinkle of mystery then definitely check this series out.",5
dragon-ball-super,"I have highly enjoyed the series so far, and had wished to be able to properly watch it instead of having to rely on illegal subs.  I am thrilled to finally be able to see it legally.Super is different than DBZ and not in a GT way lol. Super is not as much action as DBZ, but does tell more story (more dialouge but not as much as GT) and feels a lot more light heart-ed by putting in alot more comic relief. I can see why there are some hardcore DBZ fans out there that are turned off by super when comparing it to DBZ.If you are looking for a anime of just pure fighting with not much of a story line (DBZ) this show may not be for you. *Spoilers: The first 30 or so episodes are just arcs from the latest two DBZ movies (Battle of Gods, and Resurrection of Frieza).",5
dragon-ball-super,"This show is incredible and a dream to any true fan of Dragonball.The animation is a bit wonky here and there but what mainstream anime doesn't? The first two sagas are the Battle of God's and Resurrection of F movie arcs but done a lot better, and with a lot more detail and character development than the movie's in my opinion. I'm not a huge fan of the 3D animation that the movie's used either. It's a lot like a perfect mix between Dragonball and DBZ. Definitely a lot more chill than DBZ obviously because they're not dealing with something as insane as Buu (until recently obviously). A lot more comedy and non filler slice of life this time around.ONE MORE THING: Every episode is by Akira Toriyama so there's NO filler.I would highly recommend this to any true DB fan.",4.5
dragon-ball-super,"Poor animation and art style: DB and DBZ put this to shame Boring characters: Name one character that would actually make you watch specific episodes again  Broken power system: I seriously doubt Master Roshi can keep up with the crew. There are many moments I honestly thought that was BS, but whatever SSG: Really? You guys buying this shit? What's next? Give me a rainbow hair The only reason that I am not giving this 1 star is because I get to see some Vegeta's character developments and interactions with his familyDBS really fails to carry on the DB series, stop milking...",4.5
dragon-ball-super,"This series kicked butt and held my attention from the first to the final episode. It has everything you can ask for including a deeper love for the characters we've known for so long. The character development for the supporting cast is really good as well, they haven't done this as well in the previous series. The pacing was really good in the series compared to GT and DBZ given that there was very little ""downtime"" in between significant events. If this is your first time watching the series, I do recommend watching the previous series simply to appreciate the characters a bit more. However, this is easily the best iteration of Dragon Ball as I have really enjoyed it as a long time fan.",4
dragon-ball-super,"I have been a fan of the Dragon Ball series for many years with the first one I ever watched being Z on Toonami after school and then shortly after the original and gt started airing on CN. When I heard the series was coming I was excited... maybe too excited lol but let me get to the point, this comeback was simply amazing and I enjoyed it for the most part. I say most part because being that I already saw both Battle of the gods and Ressurection of F, I didn't really enjoy having to re-watch it in the first two arcs even though there were some minor changes to the story but after those two arcs it was smooth smooth sailing with the tournament of power being the highlight of series. If you love the Dragon Ball series, you will love the latest installment. Enjoy!",3
dragon-ball-super,"Watch Battle of Gods movie, then episode 15, the Resurrection of F movie, then pick up the series from episode 28 forward. Returning Dragonball back to it's comedic roots, Super is much more jokey and light hearted like Dragonball before it. That said, there is some wonderful action scenes and true to the Dragonball series, the reason behind the fights is as good as the action itself. Not as screamy as DBZ andBECAUSE OF JAPANESE CENSORSHIPhas almost no blood. Still worth the watch.",4
dragon-ball-super,"Dragon Ball Z has always been in my childhood and when i heard Dragon Ball super came out i was very excited to watch it!! I got into it really fast still into the constant fighting goku and the Z fighters are into and in the last arc made me enjoy it even more!! But it does have some cons. Con #1 is that Goku is a bit careless, yes Goku is known to be a big dummy and all but they make him careless for his family and care more for his training and to get stronger. when in DBZ Goku cared for Chichi, Gohan, and Goten. (I'm still considering the fact he is one of the worst husbands in Anime history or one of the worst XD) Con #2, Many different things changed in DBZ Like Gohan he stopped fighting and went for the life of a teacher or something yes i know this was planned beforehand but it just ruined the Gohan a lot.",4
dragon-ball-super,"Without spoilers, I've been a fan of DB since I watched Dragon Ball as a kid in the late 90s and I have watched about everything except the two (yes two) live action movies. While I am not an expert, I am a major fan and the series does work well with the same formula as the other series/story lines. So if you like the old series, then you may like this series. It does make fun of itself in spots so that's fun and there are comedic spots here and there. If you like the original, I would say enjoy it but don't expect 10/10.",5
dragon-ball-super,"Dragon Ball Super pulled at my heart strings so many times. This was a literal rollercoaster of my existence. Sometimes it is 5 stars, sometimes it is 3 stars so in the end now that the series is either over/on hiatus I feel I can review the sum of all the parts openly.The show is good. It reminded me more of the original Dragon Ball versus Z in that it was more built on comedy than action. That's not to say action is devoid, just that it was more story and plot than just intergalactic fighting. Part of what becomes frustrating about DBS is the fact this identity seems to change at several points which I guess can happen over 130+ episodes but also frustrating if you prefer one versus the other.Now let's get to the point, DBS started off hot, cooled greatly in the middle but I defy anyone to tell me from episodes 114-end wasn't some of the best anime. I'll give everyone any other argument for this show if we all can agree the first 60 or so episodes were great, the Goku Black saga wasn't very good and the first 75% of the tournament was obnoxious at best. The last 15 episodes were tremendous and must watch for any DBS fan. Wikipedia the rest, then watch those.My biggest complaint and I am sure I am not alone in this was it becoming the Goku outlasts everyone in all the galaxies show. Yes, we get it, Goku is the star and always has been but at least at several points in the original DB and DBZ, he wasn't the most powerful in all the known galaxies. This show basically butters the bread by saying ""hey everyone is ok, but Goku is the ONLY person that can go next level."" It's a shame because Vegeta's character development was absolutely fantastic this entire series but when it came to power/ability, they basically hit us over the head with an iron shovel telling us he will always be second to Goku. In fact, my biggest gripe on Vegeta during DBS is he basically accepts this! It doesn't have to be him but really when you establish a new character in Beerus and then within a few episodes, Goku is matching/surpassing his levels and Beerus is supposedly a god. We need to scale it back.So that is my long winded way of saying, this was great at the beginning, it slogged in the middle and had a fantastic end. Watch up until the Goku Black saga, skip until about episode 110 and watch the end.",4
dragon-ball-super,"Look, if you're a fan of Dragon Ball, then you'll love this plain and simple.If youre a new comer to Dragon ball, then this is a great time to jump on board the Dragon ball express. The introduction of all the new characters is what sets this Dragon Ball apart from all the others. All of the new characters they introduce just shows how the future will be great for Dragon Ball. The animation is great, the action is great, you really couldnt ask for more from a Dragon Ball series. A definite recommend.",3
dragon-ball-super,"Once I saw Dragon Ball Super on Crunchyroll in July 2015, I was very surprised and excited about this one!! I watched it the first episode and it was very good. As always I enjoyed the arcs of Dragon Ball Super, my mind just fully blown away. I really enjoyed this series so much. Also, I love the dragon ball super characters like Goku, Vegeta, Gohan, Trunks, Piccolo, and more. I was so hyped on each every episode that I watched during the entire time. Dragon Ball series takes me on the great journey. I will give 5 stars out of 5.",4
dragon-ball-super,"The good news is it's more DBZ than it is DBGT, so if you love DBZ and want more stop reading this review and just watch it already. There's no need to sing it praises so let's get into why I couldn't give it a five. Remember kids, before you hate on this review I love this series for the most part; but I gotta be fair and objective. Starting with if you saw the last two DBZ movies (Battle of Gods & Resurrection F) then you've seen the first two arcs of DBS. Yes there are subtle differences between the two versions but not enough. Also Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideThe future Trunks arc goes nowhere and only serves to explain why there are two Zeno's later. This show also has no mercy for newbies (let's be honest here, how can you call yourself otaku if you haven't seen DBZ?). Nothing is explained except for new characters powers and motivations. I understand that this is the fourth series in the franchise but a 12 year old who got a CR membership for Xmas may not have seen DBZ and might find this series unapproachable. It's a good action show with no depth, no character development and no metaphorical symbolism. For some that's good, for others that's bad. It's about guys (and gals now) punching each other, powering up, and hurling energy blasts at each other. For some that's good, others that's bad. Hence the lack of a middle ground. NOTE: Originally I was gonna give this a three but the addition of female characters who fight is innovative (For a Dragon Ball series) to elevate it to a four from me.",5
dragon-ball-super,Dragon Ball Super does not go into full blown action packed episodes from the start unlike it's DBZ counterpart. It starts with a more funny and story based start and I like it cause newer fans can get use to the characters. It's been 18 years since the last episode of DBZ and some people didn't get the chance to watch DBZ or know all it's characters but they can now.I use to hate it when people said that DBZ has no story and is all action right off the bat but now DBS shows how the characters are developing before the big battles arrive. The starting is amazing for both old Fans and new ones.The music is enjoyable but I believe Signing Bruce Faulconer as the composer can do wonders to this series.The design is not always perfect but we forgive it as we love it so much.the tournament is pretty good and the fight are great. What a finish. Can't wait for what's next!,3

dragon-ball-super,"Overall the series was a massive success, filled with 3 defining story arcs slowly introducing and expanding on each other as the series goes on. Introduces new characters, motivations, and overwhelming odds against the heroes we know today. The art style starts kinda rough in the beginning but improves and looks splendid past the 1/3 mark i would say. Filled with well animated and entertaining fights, some surprise twists here and there, and some good charactering and development for most everyone in the series. There are some characters whom, without being in the show, would not cause any sort of detriment to the overall series, both of which are from a universe introduced in the show, and are stronger than they really deserve to be. Aside from that, good series overall and a must watch for any DB fan.",4.5
dragon-ball-super,"This series buld upon the awesome franchise most of us grew up with. It's a fantastic following to DBZ. While being quite irregular at the beginning, overall quality has improved to a point where it's hard to find faults. There is the fact that setting the tournament ""time"" to less than an hour is a bit dumb, and the quite underwhelming end of the Zamasu arc, but the quality of animation and character development towards the end of the series makes up for all of this. I was especially glad that they made Gohan ""not useless"" again, afther his character hitting rock bottom at Resurrection of F. Also, seeing Goku and Freeza cooperate was a treat.I really hope DBS to continue.By the way, MasakoX and TFS, please make a DBS abridged. It would be so awesome.",5
dragon-ball-super,"I want to start off that in these times of animated shows I've never been always extremely pumped anticipating a new episode of any show mostly because there are little animated shows that I like now in these times but also to me they're few in numbers. Thankfully there's Super, there was Ushio to Tora but it ended but there's still Super! Coming from someone who has watched Dragon Ball Z on the old Toonami (I'm a veteran with the cartoon shows we're not in golden ages of cartoon anymore just about facades and acceptances) this show has that feel regardless of what ppl think of animation, fighting, conversation, soundtrack(huge improvement even over Z not just Super's beginnings) which in my book looks fine and has come a long way since its beginnings. Long story short what the cast of this show has produced is phenomenal and does animated show career proud unlike a lot of this crap out on tv now. All I can say to anyone who looks at this review is just watch the show and see for yourself but I'm confident you won't walk away disappointed. Don't just watch the show but also listen to it.",4
dragon-ball-super,"I've been watching Dragon Ball my entire life and i assure you that i am a huge fan of the series. Dragon Ball Super is no exception, with the introduction of new character and other universes is insaiyan. But its not perfect, for example i wish they didn't rush the universe survival arc so much i feel like they could have done a better job of giving the newer characters better introduction and backstories to improve the character development in the anime. The thing that irritates me the most is the animation, in some episodes the animation is like experiencing orgasms in you eyes in other episodes it feels like your eyes are being gouged out with spoon. I personally don't care how long the episodes take to develop i just want to experience detailed everything. In the episode 130 i was blown away with the animation i could not believe what i was seeing, the fight was absolutely amazing i was speechless. If every episode was animated like this Dragon Ball Super would be the greatest anime of all time hands down with no competition.",4
dragon-ball-super,"I loved dragon ball super honestly, it was very cool seeing more of goku and his friends and that idea got me hyped but THIS? this was more than i could ask for... of course, like any other anime there are some plot holes but it was so fun watching that it didn't really matter to me. Plus the animation towards the beginning of the series wasn't the best but be episode 20 or so it was fixed and the hype was back on!",5
dragon-ball-super,"Although the anime is a little slow going and takes awhile for things to pick up,  Oh boy is it worth it!!! Classic Shounen greatness and very nostalgic of DBZ but with a lot more focus on character development.Of course, the fight scenes are as epic as always, and you see some new faces you thought you wouldn't see again along with battles you thought would never come to fruition.I was very hesitant going into the anime because DBZ was the first anime I ever watched (along with many others), and I was afraid it just wouldn't be able to live up to the expectations. Though it didn't meet my expectations, that's not necessarily a bad thing; because this is honestly a DIFFERENT anime than the ones that came before it. Not in the sense of how it develops, which is very much similar; it's more or less the overall feel of the show itself. It's hard to explain but it's very good at touching new ground while still maintaining those classic Dragonball tropes, both good and bad.Overall I think it's excellent, and I look forward to its conclusion this month. I will update the review of course after I finish the show. But I don't think much will change. I hope this helps. <3",5
dragon-ball-super,"Dragon Ball Super is a great anime continuing dbz . Everywhere i go i hear people saying dbz is better , dbs sucks, dbs is the worst thing to ever happen and etc. which is annoying considering that its not all that bad. I enjoyed watching it and i would definitely watch it again. it has great fights. broken power levels, universal stuff and more. it even has the great and almighty powerful monaka, that is way too strong. Tbh sometimes reviews are completely useless. everyone has their own opinion and like different stuff. I'D suggest instead of reading a review to instead just start watching the anime. if you enjoy it then you can continue on , and if you DONT like it then you can just quietly leave instead of posting some super long review about why dbs is complete trash and doesnt deserve to be popular because of how bad it is",5
dragon-ball-super,"This literally sparked the flame of my interest back into dragon ball, and it's plot is great. The fights are well planned and executed, but there's one problem: It's too drawn out. When I want to watch an episode and find out what's happening, I don't want to watch 3 episodes of talking leading up to the fight, I want the fight just a tad bit sooner. I know it's because japanese animators have heavy workload in a small amount of time but that should be fixed by the company (i.e. more workers and better pay)",5
we-never-learn-bokuben,"This anime is a another take on the ""Good student tutors the hot chicks because he needs money"" premise. While the characters are certainly likeable enough, they are mostly one-dimensional. The protagonist is also written as the stereotypical universally hard working and nice guy, without much of a personality beyond that. You could check off the cliches as though you had a checklist, with many in the first episode. It's not a bad show, which makes the reliance on standard cliches and impossible coincidences somewhat of a tragedy. The writing is uninspired. The artwork and animation are good, but not amazing. It's a cute show. And it's got some entertainment value. But like a fast food cheeseburger, while it might satisfy you for the time being, it doesn't feel like a memorable experience. Which is an unfortunate case of unrealized potential.It isn't as though I disliked it. 3 stars is a positive rating, and I would watch another season. It just didn't do anything particularly memorable. They are all nice, cute girls. And there's no shortage of anime which offers that.",4.5
we-never-learn-bokuben,"This show it definitely worth following every week. Especially if you’re a Quintessential Quintuplets fanThus far, I find this show quite similar to Quintessential Quintuplets, but there are some striking differences as to the way this MC communicates with the initial girls. I found the gentle nature of his approach and his desire to understand where these girls are coming from refreshing. The girls are geniuses in their respective subjects but fall flat on their opposite, logic vs creativity, right brained thinker vs left brained thinker, and this week added an athletic student with a crush on the tutor since middle school.I’m going to continue watching and won’t be able to help comparing with the quintuplets but I think this show may have a much more down to earth approach than the over the top style of quintessential quintuplets which I really enjoy. Plus, this tutor is much more approachable and kindhearted than Futaro.",3
we-never-learn-bokuben,"I had a lot of doubt going into this series because I had heard many negative comments having to do with the fact that the animation studios making the show had not done much. But boy was I relieved when the first episode came out and it had quality animation as well as great voice acting.Now the second episode comes out and it's just superb, the manga is being adapted well and you can see all of the character's emotions displayed efficiently.It's definitely a must watch for anyone who likes a goofy harem. It's not the typical harem you see all the time, it's a lot more realistic but the comedy is what really makes it worth the watch.",5
we-never-learn-bokuben,"I've enjoyed what I've seen right now (s2, episode 8), and the girls are all adorable. Although honestly, that's about where it ends. The most I can say is it's very cute and good ""soul food"" for lack of a better word.So far there's very little for actual progression or development between characters and their relationship, other than Ogata being able to express emotions better. The rest of the series and how the characters react to the generic-main-character-who-works-hard-and-is-nice-to-everybody hardly changes. Most of the girls are overly innocent and miss obvious signs or hints that a viewer will pick up instantly, and make a lot of the scenarios awkward. Compare season 2 of this to the Quints first season, it's obvious which one has more character development and changes in relationships.Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideWhat caught be off guard with this series is in s2 ep8. Uruka is offered to study abroad after performing well in nationals. Rather than declining and staying home because she wants to be with Nariyuki, she actually accepts, knowing their relationship might change! Finger's crossed this doesn't go the Oreimo route and Nariyuki goes after her to bring her back home, and we end up back in square one with no changes in the relationship, and Uruka being held back from her career. This show's not that memorable, and I'll probably forget about this one once it's done until I come across some fan art on social media or something. This doesn't mean it's bad, though. I've really enjoyed my experience and would gladly watch a season 3 if it were to ever happen. It's very cliche and generic, but it's executed in such a way that it still works",5
we-never-learn-bokuben,"This show is like watching somebody play a really tedious-but-suggestive dating sim. I'm ok with that. If you like your jokes cheesy and your cliches very cliched, come on in, sempai. Look, this show is basic af, and CR wants me to write longer review. So, let's rate possible ships:1. Nariyuki x Uruka (best girl)2. Nariyuki x Fumino3. Nariyuki x Mafuyu (yes i went there)4. Nariyuki x Asumi-senpai5. Riza x Sawako6. Mafuyu x Asumi7. Nariyuki x the entire maid cafe8. Nariyuki's anonymous friends x the anonymous girls in the public bath9. Nariyuki x Riza (love you Riza but last on this list)",5
we-never-learn-bokuben,"Learning, in and of itself, can be sexy, which is one reason why uncomfortable attraction vibes can easily stir between students and teachers. When that's combined with real established anxiety and a need for affirmation, you have a solution to the ""Yeah, right, the girls like him"" harem quandary. Yeah, right, they like the tutor because he teaches them to learn in ways they had not been able to before, because he's kind and patient, and because he's acceptably good-looking and quick on the uptake.This show is really good. The girls who the tutor helps are all charming and actually a bit complex, and they form friendships that don't rise or fall on competition for the guy they like in common. All of this takes place in a world sweetly drawn and animated. If your soul is hurting, this show might help ease it. It did mine.",4
we-never-learn-bokuben,"The story is pretty cool, I mean, the genre isnt new, the plot isnt new, the whole ""tutor"" thing has become a trend, and it's pretty fun and interesting to watch our boring basic main character, have all the girls throw themselves at him, but at the same time it's annoying that somehow he is unaware of these girls having the hots for him... obviously I'm exaggerating with the ""throw themselves"", the girls like him and that's about it, only one of them throws herself at him... but it's pretty much a guy tutoring 3 girls that have mixed feelings for this dude that has no qualities, other than being selfless and smart. Like seriously, I dont get how people give this a 5 or even 4 star rating. No wonder anime is so condensed with garbage. Theres nothing special about this story, but it is cool and interesting and fun, all female characters are cool and cute, but the MAIN MALE character is so generic like always.. 3 stars is more than enough, if the Male character was interesting, then I'd give it 4, but no..  same stupid generic character like always.",5
we-never-learn-bokuben,I saw this as one of this seasons new shows and I decided to watch. By looking at the cover art for We Never Learn: Bokuben I expected as slice of life school harem anime. I have thought the the characters were well developed. I watched the first episode and I enjoyed it and continued to binge watch the next five episodes. i have enjoyed watching We Never Learn: Bokuben and I recommend and will continue to watch.,5
we-never-learn-bokuben,"I found the first episode rather exhilarating. It may not be completely original, and by all means most animes are not, but you'd be lying if you said it wasn't good. I was recommended to watch it by a friend who is in the process of reading the manga. A beautiful intro soundtrack followed by presumably strong story and characters with distinguishable, memorable traits. I found myself smiling and by the end of it eager as to what will happen next. Defiantly worth watching and critiquing for yourself.",4
we-never-learn-bokuben,"The show isn't original by it's overall plot, a boy who is good in all subjects has to tutor girls that are amazing in only one, but it's still a fun anime. The show seems full of good humor and has very good artwork throughout the first episode at least.    The opening and closing songs are catchy and upbeat enough that I will likely listen to both every episode.    No one so far seems like a terrible character either. All of them have at least some flaws that give them depth, and will most likely be plot points in later episodes.   I give this anime 5 finished notebooks out of 5.",4
we-never-learn-bokuben,"Honestly this anime was just amazing for the first season, and I loved it and thought that it had very good potential.... and then it literally just goes straight downhill season 2. Not to say that the story itself wasn't good, but you just wouldn't see it coming. If you like anticipation and doubt I would recommend this anime for you, however just know that you were warned before you emotionally invested yourself in this train wreak.",5
we-never-learn-bokuben,"Bokuben is a standard harem anime with a similar concept to Quintessential Quintuplets.  Unfortunately, unlike Quintessential Quintuplets, it never breaks away from the mold or does anything to outshine the tired old harem character tropes.Plot 2/5: Plot-wise its about as standard as it can get. A bunch of girls are idiots in specific ways and want to pursue higher education and career's in exactly the topics that they are weakest at. You have a growing entourage of cute girls that are attracted to the most generic main just because he's a nice guy. He tutors these girls because he wants that coveted college recommendation from his high school. Plot points are just about the same as in any other generic high school harem anime. There's tests they study for, a school festival, a fireworks thing, and some random family drama. Usually for these harem anime, I put it to the test of, if there was no ecchi, would there be any plot. Unfortunately, there isn't really enough character development, drama, or change to really speak of in the anime. It's like 90% fluff. Characters 3/5: Characters are similarly generic, you have your no personality main character and his harem of girls who have frustratingly 2 dimensional personalities and fit exactly in the archetypes you'd expect. There's the kuudere smart girl, a cool beauty teacher, an energetic childhood friend, a petanko senpai and the princess. Each has some level of backstory and character development. My personal favorite is Furuhashi who has probably the most developed backstory and best character development. Everyone else more or less stays the same way as they start off, with minor growth and character development. Art/Animation 3/5: Art is fairly standard, but it does have some decent animation, most notably in the school festival. It's not amazing, and things are usually drawn in a relatively cutsy style rather than a drop dead oh my god this looks amazing type of look, but the animation isn't bad. The most I can really say is that it's standard what you'd expect from an anime created in 2019.Sound 3/5: Season 1 OP and ED's are very skippable. Second season had a catchy OP and ED, but not amazing. There's some decently nice soundtracks that I could see myself listening to outside of the anime. Voice acting is decently good too. Again not anything that really stands out to me as just amazing, but it gets the job done.Enjoyment 3/5: This anime will fill your harem fix. It's not amazing and if you want something that's similar but just better in many different ways, I recommend Quintessential Quintuplets (which I wrote a review for). For a casual viewing it's a cute, feel good story that will keep your attention to the end. Don't read this spoiler if you care who actually ends up with the MC at the end. I don't say explicitly but I hint. Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideI like how this anime actually makes a decision at the end. Where most harem anime just ends with like OH ITS ONE OF THESE GIRLS and they just run off into the distance yelling at each other. This anime actually makes a decision. I kind of disagree with who it should be, but at least they have the balls to go for it. Overall 3/5: This is one of those anime where you might not really care about it that much but its pleasant enough to watch to the end. It hits your harem fix and has all the cute girls you want hitting a very diverse set of tropes. I'd recommend Quintessential Quintuplets over this if you want something that is basically the same plot but executed better with more plot.",4.5
we-never-learn-bokuben,"With it having just finished recently, I'm not sure how long this show is going to linger in my heart, but it was certainly a fun and light adventure that tried to fill the hole in my heart that's been there since Nisekoi finished. That being said, it wasn't what I would call a perfect show.The Art: It's good. The reason I mentioned Nisekoi in my opening statement should become pretty obviously pretty much right away. A lot of this show looks very much like Nisekoi looked. While there aren't any crazy over-the-top action scenes like Nisekoi had, everything here is still pretty nice, and even the obviously computer generated car isn't too intrusive.The Characters: This is usually the home-run in these sweet little who's the hero going to date romantic harem shows, but it's actually the part where I dock this show a tiny little bit. All of the characters have nice designs, and are interesting enough that I want to know a whole lot about them, and that is kind of the problem with this show. When we first start our hero is the tutor for two girls, and you'd think that those two would be the focus. The problem (and it's also present in the manga) is that this show has a terrible case of a wandering eye. It starts introducing other potential romantic rivals before fully fleshing out those first two. Every once in a while it comes back and adds a little bit more to one of them, but then doesn't really do a deep dive into the other until the show is coming in for a landing. When you compare this to something like Nisekoi, where you kind of knew the origin story of every potential romantic rival an episode or two after they showed up, I'm not sure I'd pick this one instead.The Story: Is very beast-of-the week. Thinking back on it now, I remember a lot of the highlights and peak moments, but if you cut them all up and told me to put them in order, I'm not sure that I could. That might sound bad, but it actually isn't. Almost every episode is kind of a self-contained thing (sometimes two self-contained things). You start the episode and they've set up a scenario. Romantic comedy things happen. They resolve the story, and if there was a joke it pays off. It actually makes for a nice relaxing low-stakes watch. It also does a thing that a lot of these shows are afraid to do, and at the end our hero actually picks a girl, which is a surprising development that I can get behind, even if I'm not sure I agree with his choice (come at me fanboys).Final Thoughts: For me this show was the bandage that my heart needed after the end of things like Quintessential Quintuplets and Nisekoi. At no point was it as good as either of those two shows, but it tried, and that effort was appreciated.",4.5

we-never-learn-bokuben,"I want to watch this because it seems similar to QQ. However, there is one thing stopping me from watching this anime. The girl in overalls looks anywhere from 5 to 8 years old. All of the other girls look normal, but I feel like a pedophile even LOOKING at the cover art. I don't want to see a harem with a third grader that would use safety scissors. I don't need a harem with a girl who would put GLUESTICKS into her little CUBBY and then CRY because she can't open the CAPRISUN packet. Literally, everything else looks good. It makes me genuinely sad that I can't watch this without feeling like a to-be star on To Catch a Predator.",3
we-never-learn-bokuben,"Hi, member of team blue here, just wanted to say this show is FANTASTIC! All of the girls are fantastic though, Asumi with her relentless teasing, Mafuyu and her eccentricities involving bugs and liquor, Rizu's seriousness, Uruka's determination and love for swimming, and Fumino's love for the stars. Loved every second. I love how Nariyuki cares about all of them and wants to help them succeed in what they want to do.",5
we-never-learn-bokuben,"Not going to lie, I started watching Bokuben because of the meme with Furuhashi looking shocked but I was pleasantly surprised. Out of all the animes I have watched slice of life/harem have been far and few between but I have really enjoyed every episode so far.This anime has really nice character progression and intimate relationships that expand into onces you can back and support all the way through. The show also isn't afraid to be lewd to the max but it plays off in a far more comical than creepy fashion, so much so that I found myself laughing out loud unexpectedly at scenes throughout the series. The story branches just enough to keep it interesting but not so much that it starts to be confusing for the audience. It's a fantastic watch that I would highly suggest to slice of life/harem fans and your everyday anime watchers alike! I certainly look forward to what the rest of season two has to offer!",5
we-never-learn-bokuben,"Nariyuki Yuiga is an impoverished third-year high school student, pouring blood, sweat, and tears to receive a VIP nomination scholarship to cover his college tuition fees. One day, the school's headmaster offers him the chance to gain the scholarship, but there is a catch. Rizu Ogata, Fumino Furuhashi, and Uruka Takemoto are some of the best students in his school. However, while each of them are top of their class for their respective strengths, all three of them are working towards dreams that involve their weakest subjects. Except Takemoto, she's working for a sports scholarship, and is terrible at studies in general. The headmaster will give Yuiga his scholarship, if he can help these three girls in their studies. While each of them are fantastic students, they are seemingly hopeless in studies involving their goals. Yuiga, who isn't particularly the best in anything, now has a lot on his plate as a normal student trying to teach the elites in this harem romantic comedy.We Never Learn is so much better than I thought it was going to be, let me say that right now. Back when this show aired in spring 2019 (nearly six months ago) I saw the first episode and wasn't impressed. However, with a second season airing just around the corner, (a week from writing this) I figured that this anime was at least competent. So I decided to give it another go.Long story short, it won me over effortlessly, and all that credit goes directly to all six of the anime's leads. Now I'll admit, it was easy at first to pass over this anime, especially since The Quintessential Quintuplets had just finished airing at the time, but after giving it the time of day I am eating my words like dirt. I will be talking mostly about the characters in this review since it's the strong suit of the anime, I'll talk about Nariyuki Yuiga's character last. Rizu Ogata serves as a sort of tsundere character, although she isn't loud and proud about it like most tsundere characters. She becomes easier to talk to quickly, and shows off a very adorable side while trying to be the most mature one in the room. Fumino Furuhashi is the most normal one of the group. She comes off a bit ditzy at first, yet is able to read everyone like an open book. Most of the characters come to her with their problems too, which is hilarious since she has already read them like a book, and already knows their problem but can't reveal what else she knows for fear of causing more discourse. Uruka Takemoto is already in love with Yuiga from the start, but can't find the courage to tell him. She's full of energy and gets along with everyone, characters like her are not original, but they are always fun to have in harem comedies. Mafuyu Kirisu is the Student Counselor, she's a kuudere through and through. Or more accurately tries to be. Never showing any weakness around the students, while also being generally clumsy or lazy in private. She's actually more of a mayadere, in a slice of life if you can believe that. Finally there's Asumi Kominami, who's a graduate of their school, popping into the story later to tease Yuiga and fight the rest of the girls for the spot of best girl. Which is honestly the main reason you should watch this show, all of the girls are a great candidate for best girl. I honestly Don't know which one was my favorite, so I'm going to sit on the fence and pick all of them! So where does our protagonist Nariyuki Yuiga come in? Well that's where the story really lies, since all of the girls are flawed despite being geniuses in their respective strengths. Nariyuki Yuiga, a normal student with no specific strengths, comes together to help encourage them to keep going. Admiring that they all are struggling just like him to achieve their own goals, he takes it upon himself to keep them from backing down. It's very similar to the anime I mentioned earlier, The Quintessential Quintuplets, except with different character backgrounds, and more of an emphasis on comedy. If you have seen and are a huge fan of Quintuplets like me, I think you'll enjoy this one too. If you haven't seen this seemingly new trend of tutoring focused harem comedies, I'd say you shouldn't make the same mistake I did, and have some fun with We Never Learn!",5
we-never-learn-bokuben,"While it seems that this might be very inspired by Quintessential Quintuplets, I can't say which came out first in the manga for certain so I'll review it on its own as best I can.This is the kind of show that was just a very comfortable and easy watch.  It had some serious moments but in general it just had a ton of heart and feelsgoodman moments.  The characters were all very likable with the male lead being a little underwhelming (but let's face it, who cares about him anyway?) and they all had lead moments.  It was funny, clever, and heartwarming.  I take off a star only for the overused ridiculous art moments that I didn't really feel added to the show.  Too many dumb faces and lines and all those other tropes, I'm just not into it.  Solid show, would recommend a watch.",3
we-never-learn-bokuben,It's lighthearted for the most part and has enough substance to keep your interest. The manga is great and I love the parts of the show where they have the chibi heads pop up and talk. It is very true to the manga's style and I hope that anyone who loved this show would pick up the manga. It's definitely worth it! Especially because the anime can't cover all of the stuff that has happened in the manga. ENJOY!,3
we-never-learn-bokuben,This is a really good anime and i wanna tell you it not a heaream even through there are girls in the picture that likes him all of them don't which makes sense. Most people don't have six girls liking them. It also gives the girls true motivation for learning and himself has motivation for helping them other then just wanting to help his friends. They all develop and become better from their friendships and it a pretty good anime because of it. If your looking for a slice of life anime this may be for you.,4
we-never-learn-bokuben,"This is a harem anime, and if you hate harems, then it probably still wont change your mind. But, this is the right way to make a harem anime! You have a main character who is actually likable and easy to relate to. You have a varied and well developed cast of very different girls, all with their own distinct personalities. It's a harem and it knows full well it isn't a serious story and it takes full advantage of that fact to deliver outlandish and amazing scenarios that would almost never happen in real life. I laughed so much throughout this show! This series has jumped right to the top of my list as the best harem anime I have ever seen, and one of the best comedies! An absolute gem and a must watch for fans of either comedy or harem anime!And perhaps the best news upon the end of season 1 is a confirmation of season 2! None of the nonsense where the studio leaves you hanging wondering if the show will ever continue! Pros:Outstanding cast with great character development!Laugh so hard you cry humor!Great music!Colorful and creative visuals!Cons:It's a harem. It's massively unrealistic. (This however could be called a pro too!)",5
we-never-learn-bokuben,"While the anime contains a lot of cliches and all, the character progression in here is absolutely awesome. I never thought that a slice of life romance comedy could be this good. In fact, so good that I read the manga in one go and bought the first 4 volumes that are currently translated.So character progression, pacing and characters all are very well written and the story is very interesting.Normaly not my type of anime but this one is just teriffic. It really fun to watch.",4
we-never-learn-bokuben,"I think I'm like a of reviewers I have read who started watching this show because I loved Quintessential Quintuplets. It is a very different anime from QQ though. I would say the only similarity is that one guy tutors four girls. The characters each have their own querks, but one thing I love about it is how the M.C. supports their dreams and is helping achieve them and not just telling them to ""stick to what they are good at"" like everyone else. It also has a great deal of heart, which I think makes it even better.",4.5
we-never-learn-bokuben,"I'm surprised by how many new Anime get 5 stars from so many people. This one is good, but not nearly as good as, for example, ""Fruit Basket"" or the one about the occult phenomena.The characters on this one seem a bit one dimensional and not very believable; barring some severe learning disability a student can't be excellent in Math and zero in literature. At least in the story with the five sisters the characters were more believable and relatable.",4.5
we-never-learn-bokuben,Been really looking forward to this. A great manga series that I am about 3 volumes in. So happy to see this series get an anime. Another of these funny tutor scenarios where the main character is put in a position of having to teach some of the elite girls at the school. The thing that makes this series stand out from the rest though is the writing and characters. The writing I just feel is really well thought out and carried throughout this series. They do a good job of balancing funny situations and romantic segments. When these two elements are well implemented give you a real satisfactory feeling that your actually personally invested in. Not only that but these characters are given an element of realism. This keeps the story grounded and relate able.,5
one-punch-man,"I feel like the show still has its fun personality, and the start already shows a lot of promise. The show is obviously not perfect, but let's not pretend like season 1 was either. The animation is a tiny bit uncanny, but I think if we make comparisons to the first season too.. Season 1 didn't have the most perfect animation. Overall, One-Punch Man has fun characters, nice soundtrack and interesting plot. I'm looking forward to more of this show, and have rewatched season 1 several times now.Edit: As I wrote this when it had just started, I feel like I need to add to this later on. My beliefs are still the same. I feel it delivered. One thing I have to critique is that there are too many cliffhangers. Definitely something I will be binging and rewatching later on.",4
one-punch-man,my region is unable to view this without a vpn so i suggest using a VPN if you live in the western united states i hope this is helpful word word word thing that makes sense to say so that this is long enough to be posted on crunchy roll as a review so i will keep writing and trying to submit until it excepts my submission and will be hopefully read and be helpful to someone and nord vpn or Avast vpn are good vpns that i trust just thought i should add that if im stuck typing anyway,4
one-punch-man,Of course this season is worse than season 1 but compared to other anime it is very good. The only thing that bothered me in the first episode were fights but i think there were so many cuts in them because the animators made new scenes to replace ones that received bad feedback.I think that in the next episodes there will be more fluid fights because the animators have more time to upgrade the quality of them than what time they had to fix episode 1.Opening in my opinion is nearly as good as the last one and I can't wait for the full version of the music video.,5
one-punch-man,"Season 1 focused mainly on Saitama, and the supporting cast. Season 2's focus is mainly on Garo. Which makes sense if you ask me, he's this arc's bad-guy, after all. Yes the animation is a bit different than season 1. So what? Can't expect two different companies to produce the exact same product. TL;DR: Not the same animation. Focus is mostly on the bad-guy. People are salty because OPM S2 is mostly about character building, not mostly about Saitama.",5
one-punch-man,"The worry about studio was totally overblown.So far this season has been awesome and I'm just loving more OP man to watch.Maybe the animation isn't as top tier as the previous season, but I've sat through countless anime with worse and had a good time. I think that this show had too much exposure to the mainstream who will look for any reason to get a tweet trending, so they ragged on this before it had even debuted.I can't wait to watch more.",5
one-punch-man,"The style hasnt changed too much and the show does still retain it's persona however the animation holds it back at times with cuts in place of animation resolving battles without even seeing him throw the punch and in fast fight scenes replacing movement with fast cuts and flashy effects whilst characters remain still.Mostly though I feel though the humour is still there that it doesnt feel as effective as it did before, whether this is because the contrast in detailed animation to lack there of isnt as effective or if the delivery or joke isnt as fresh I cant fully say.",4
one-punch-man,"after finishing the last episode of season 2 it felt like nothing really happend compared with season 1. Season 2 focuses more on other heroes and sprinkles in saitama here and there, which is fine and i like getting into the other heroes more but i feel like the story really crams in alot of scenes of random heroes noone really cares about that get offd in minutes and it just makes each episode feel like not much happens overall. from comments it looks like the 12 episodes are the end of season 2 and it ended ok but i feel like it just didnt flow very well and really left me unsatisfied unlike with the end of season 1. I look forward to season 3 but hope the pacing is better.",5
one-punch-man,"The One Punch Man series is a masterpiece to me, the 1st anime season was amazing! After I finish watching it, I went straight to continuing the story by reading the manga, one of the few animes I would go and do that. Reading it, it was just as good from first season, lot of times I gone emotional and excited over! When watching this 2nd season which is an adaptation of the story I read from the manga, I notice there is a lack of ""emotions and excitement"" put into this anime. On top of the lacking/change of animation, J.C. Staff just skims most of the story scenes, making some scenes lacking compared to what was depicted in the manga which would've been a big deal. With a lot of still shot combat, with cut and crammed story in a 12 episode anime, I felt J.C. Staff didn't even try with the show and it breaks my heart.  :""(",5
one-punch-man,"i never liked anime. this show got me into anime about 3 years ago. i recall it being on crunchyroll for some time and was then removed. these reviews are so skewed, almost as skewed as how the hero system in is portrayed. if you don't like this show you honestly can't comprehend the concept. it almost makes fun of anime in such an indescribable way BUT the story behind saitama is so much more. ill admit the second season is all over the place due to the studio change, but it gets REALLY good RIGHT at the end of the season. season 2 basically starts at the last episode. i love everything about this show.",3
one-punch-man,"One Punch Man does a wonderful job of parodying the Super Hero Genre. It might only have a few jokes in its arsenal, but it is a master at hitting the bullseye every time.The Art: Season 1 delivers on this in spades. They use every cell perfectly. Having read the manga, it really does feel like seeing that only in anime form. Not a lot of anime really deliver on that as much as season one of OPM does.While season 2 took a bit of a dip, it's still as good as most other anime these days. I don't really feel it would be fair to dock this series any points because the second season was just a little bit above average in the animation department.The Characters: This is where this show really shines. All of the characters are amazing. Even though a lot of them are dumb tropes, or parodies of other things, they always feel like they are handled with care. All of the cast of this show is fun and interesting, even the monsters that only show up for a single episode. Like the best written comedies, it feels like everyone gets a chance to be funny and charming. It's hard to have a favourite character given how awesome all of the characters in this show are.The World: The world is excellent parody. Things are wacky and crazy, but the world also has rules. More than that, it doesn't feel like the rules just exist as excuses. While things are dumb and crazy, they are dumb and crazy in a way that feels believable. While My Hero Academia approaches the world of super heroes with the optimistic adventurous soul of adolescence, One Punch Man comes at it with the bitter and jaded outlook of an older generation, while still also being fun and funny. To compare it to other things, I'd say OPM is about halfway between Tiger And Bunny and My Hero Academia.The OP: The OPs for both Season 1 and 2 are amazing. They are as over-the-top as the show, and will get you pumped up and ready to watch the crazy action of every episode. This is one of those shows where I went to amazon to buy myself the album for the OP, it really is that good.Final Verdict: One Punch Man is one of those perfect shows. While Season 2 might have left a little bit desired, it never crushed the pure joy I got from watching the show. This is one of those shows where the show made me feel the same whimsical joy that I had when I read the manga, and that's a hard target to hit. While the story does start to meander a bit from its original thesis in season 2 and starts to become the thing that it's parodying, that is the natural evolution of this kind of parody. Eventually when you do something ironically you just end up doing the thing.Honestly, I'd probably score this 4.5 out of 5 stars, but given how blown away I still feel when I think about watching season 1, I just can't bring myself to dock this any marks.One Punch Man is a good and funny show, and even while it is painting its world with a rather cynical brush, its story still moves me and makes me feel hope.",5
one-punch-man,"I think this will be my third time watching it now after writing this review. My brother first mentioned it to me before I saw the anime and from his explanation, I thought it was funny and be cool to watch. Once I actually started watching, I absolutely loved it. It's funny and even if I knew how it would end, I still enjoy watching it because I want to see how it ends. After watching the second season, it wasn't as great as I hoped it would be when I read the manga. I believed it was a little long and dragged out, but I kind of felt that way when I was reading the manga because I just wanted to see Saitama. However, I started enjoying Garou's story later on. Maybe season 2 felt off because of where it ended, but from reading the manga I wouldn't have known where to end season 2 either. I have only been rewatching the first season because it's very satisfying. I'm not interested in sonic and the girl leader in the B rank tho, just my opinion because of their obsessions can be annoying. I did like story/scene with sonic when he was with the little bear tho and the one scene in season 2 where he was deciding to eat the monster food.Sorry I rambled a little.Anyways I still enjoy this anime and I hope season 3 turns out well if they are making another season. I hope they do!",4
one-punch-man,"ok so one punch man or op man aka sitama aka the caped baldy. this is probably the top anime for me it takes this superhero op thing to the max the reason im not a fan of superman is becuse he is way to op and and is arogant about it ive, and i think thats whats makes superheroes in general boring when yo make a character thats basiclly invinceble and dont give them any humanity thats what this show does best we have sitama literally the strongest character he is given more power than anyone and with that he feals like he loses his humanity so he faces everyday just trying to go on with his life and have fun so insted of fighting evil all he wants to do is to try to get his humanity back. Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hidehe literally is more woried about a sale on the supermarket than fighting an evil doctor  i give this series a 5/5. the animation is worse in the second season but it honestly isnt to bad to look away from the series yes the first season have better animation and greater style, but it still is worth watching season two just for the story and comedy.",4

one-punch-man,"This is a great series, the writing is just as the first season was, simply picks up where S1 ended. People are complaining about the animation being different, but it's really not THAT different; if you stop caring, you won't even notice.The story comes across as somewhat more grown up this time, Garo's actions are far more real and emotionally impactful than any monster from season 1. I find all the characters likable, with great banter. Excellent.",4
one-punch-man,"Ok so the storytelling and animation was amazing and a contrapoint to season 1 that was only focused on humour and big fights. Season 2 had a great build up, but it ended too quickly. It didnt give the satisfaction needed after such a build. Kind of ruined the vibe and hype for the next episode. I got dissapointed when i came here today to watch ep 13. but there is none. Season 13 is hopefully going to not to long into the future and as good as season 2 and season 1. please dont let us hang on such a bad cliff again",1
one-punch-man,"Personally I went into this second season with essentially no knowledge, but with a healthy dose of excitement as I loved the first season. Upon watching it I knew something was up, it didn't feel right to me, but I hadn't watched the last season recently enough to pinpoint it. Now, having realised the change in studio (but more importantly the lack of certain animating staff) I definitely agree with everyone out there, it straight up doesn't look as good, in saying that it doesn't look 'bad' (apart from those god awful attempts at 3D). Despite my initial disappointment, a few episodes in and I can confidently say that this is still the show that I know and love, just slightly less epic. Definitely worth the watch.",5
one-punch-man,"S2 is starting slow but having read the manga I feel it will be worth the wait. S2 is exploring a lot of different side stories and is doing a good job building the world and characters around Saitama making him in a way ""less"" overpowered than in S1, even though he still basically is the strongest being in the universe. I do agree the first episodes feel a bit rushed though, and I hope it will become better as the season progresses.",5
one-punch-man,"Season 2 is overshadowed by Season 1's great animations. Non the less, this still feels like One Punch Man. Saitama is being less stupid about stuff, which is my main drawback when i started watching, because it defined him as a character. He has smartened up and feels like a little different Saitama, and its maybe for the better? The main reason i think they did this was because they have to cover so much of the story that dialogue has been shortened down, compared to the manga, and there is no time to fool around for ages and minutes on end. As a result, Saitama grasps the situation and intent of others much quicker than in the previous season. As another result, however, we get less internal dialogue as well.A thing this season is doing very well is character building of the other characters we are introduced to and stunning visuals and imagery. They are very effective at progressing the characters and story, we get quickly caught up on what all characters of interest are doing in the first episode and keeps introducing us to more characters resulting in the world fleshing out quite nicely and at a rather good pace.I wish, ofc, that the animations were on par with season 1, but other than that this is One Punch Man and i love it.",5
one-punch-man,"One punch man is finally back! Im not sure why people are complaining, they are basically nitpicking at this point as the season 1 is perfect. The opening sequence is good. It has the same feel as the first season. I do have to agree that Genos look quite different especially with that extra metal shine on him but beyond that I'm stoked.Update:I loved opm2 especially after episode 8. Stick with it guys.",5
one-punch-man,"I really was disappointed about the audio tracks and voices, the animation is important and the audio is really important, at least the voice is the most important so the voice actor can express the feelings of the character, and i think that this season we lost that, we lost the good audio tracks and with the new studio so be it, but the lost of quality and effort in the voices is killing me for real. We lost that stupid and funny and enthusiastic Saitama that were have the past season only for how is the voice acting, really if you read the manga is a lot better than this 2 chapters, the only part that i think they nailed it was the ""aftercredits"" scene of the second chapter when Garou appears attacking Tank Top Vegetarian, that was with a good voice and track if only the complete chapter was like that in audio even with a low quality animation than past season the chapters would be so much better than what it is now. Really hope that it improves",5
one-punch-man,"Fights are awful most of the time. Sound effects make it worse, with bad audio transitions.Story is rushed, and that might be an understatement. They are skipping A LOT of things.Animation is so bad sometimes that I have to mention it a 2nd time. (ghosting, weirdly drawn frames that are not in-betweens, crucial animation errors like with the octopus)The only thing that feels right are the music and voice acting, everything should be redone from 0.",5
one-punch-man,"We all know S1 was great.S2 has failed to live up to expectations. 7 Episodes in, the story is still poor. Barely anything has happened, and for a parody I feel like there is an acceptable amount of filler, jokes, pointless character and side story - but everything feels like filler, pointless characters and side stories in season 2.The overarching story of the return of the alien race & rise of monsters is super obvious, BUT we ALL know how it will end. One punch.",4
one-punch-man,"I am rating this show 3 stars to average out the ABSOLUTE 5 STAR RATING OF PERFECTION that was the first season... with the entirely mediocre second. Proudly displaying unenthusiastic voice lines with as few mouth flaps and as many close-up shots as JC Staff could cram in to do this cheaply... season 2 is a 2/5 even in a vacuum for how forgettable it makes the fantastic source material - but when you compare it to season 1, a celebration of the anime industry's best talent from many studios and works coming together to create 12 truly breathtaking episodes where every second is a masterpiece... and S2 just can't hold a feather to the series-of-light-punches wind of the original.They're killing my baby, and all I can do is hope that MadHouse gets to fix this before OPM gets Berserk'd",4
chihayafuru,"I have nothing but praise for Chihayafuru. Honestly.No really. At first I didn't even  consider watching this anime because the art is different from regular animes such as Shugo Chara. I gave it a try because there were no animes that appealed to me but i really wanted to watch a new series. The first episode you're thinking: ""Ok..the art is fine...I can get used to this..."" and then before you know it you're swept away by the story.  No. This is not a Pokemon card game-like show. No. It's not a fantasy card game anime like Yugioh (my brother watched that. whatever)It's a Japanese traditional card game. It's real world; no fairies; no magical powers (but talent that might as well be magic!) It's a series you NEVER would think you'd watch and before you know it you're watching it; dying to see what comes next, and thinking it's one of the greatest animes you've probably ever watched. The storyline is simple, the music is fine, the characters are lovable, and the animation is uniquely beautiful. No sexual explicitness like most animes here on Crunchyroll. (there goes a couple people) An anime that at first might strike you as boring but is most  definitely not. Watch it, and you might just love it. 'Nuff said. ~_^",5
chihayafuru,"I loved Chihaya Furu from beginning to end.  I can't believe how into the kurata matches I became.  I loved the animation.  It was ""soft,"" but fit the dreamlike state and mindset of the lead character, Chihaya, and her ability to pull people in.  The writing is very good.  The characters were written with great care and chemistry which was expressed exceptionally well by the actors.  The only problem with Chihaya Furu is that it was too short.",5
chihayafuru,"Before Chihayafuru, Karuta was a game that was almost completely unknown outside of Japan. I typically stay away from shows like this, even if it's based on real games (ex. Hikaru no Go), but this show is different. I've watched the first 50 episodes that have been released to this point, and it looks like it may be another year or so before/if we get Chihayafuru 3 since the manga is not that far ahead of the anime as of July 2013. The recent developments in the anime and manga all point to a very strong possibility that this show is destined to have exactly 100 episodes, a very appropriate number for a show about Karuta. I have fears that this is the final episode, though, knowing Japan. Cancel the great episodic show in favor of 12-episode garbage you can animate, voice act, edit, etc etc and crap out in just 5 months.I can already see where some of the main plot is going, but I do find myself emotionally invested with the characters. It's a great anime (please don't go bonkers because I dared to only give it a 'great' 4-star rating. I don't hand them out like dog treats), enough that I'll be spoiling myself by reading manga as it's released from here on out. However, this is definitely one of those shows that needs to be animated.The odds of Karuta catching on in the United States are zero, but I'm sure there's a couple of people that have read the Ogura Hundred Poems.This is a very hard show to translate. Some of the poems seem lost in translation, but others are not.I didn't notice any deep animation flaws like other shows typically do, and the music is memorable. I needed a show to help me forget about that awful Amnesia show I saw that was only 12 episodes, and 50 episodes of a show that knows what it's doing was just the ticket.I've heard unfortunate rumors that there will be no 3rd season, and that the 2nd season was only made to promote the manga. Sales of Blu-Ray and DVDs are low in Japan. This may be the last we see of Chiahayafuru, so do what you can and fight to have all the manga volumes released in North America and all over the world.",5
chihayafuru,"My first impressions about this anime were very similar to everyone else's; I assumed it was going to be a boring story about a girl and a bunch of cards. The plot didn't seem to me like something that would be able to grasp my attention. But it amazed me after I watched the show, to what degree I was proven wrong.This show is just magnificent- no other words can honestly describe it. The story is rather predictable and the way the plot line unfolds is rather revealing. We know how its going to end, but the journey to the finish line is what we really want to know. The characters are truly the gem of this entire story. They feel so real and unique and develop in unpredictable ways. Suetsugu Yuki is a brilliant mangaka; she was really able to grasp the essence of Karuta and its 100 poems and string them into her characters thoughts, actions and perceptions. You meet the characters, and you truly to get to know them- their weaknesses and inner struggles, who they see as their foils and their own reasons for playing Karuta. The characters work hard; they are not perfect; they don't strive for perfection, rather they find faults in themselves and try to improve; they are also not unrealistically strong- rather they become strong.The story is such a refreshing breath of air! I have never come across a sports animation in any language, that could actually make me want to play the sport that it portrays!! Overall, the show really isn't just about the sport, it can teach you things too. We can relate to the characters in more than one way and what they learn can actually be life lessons for us to. The animation is so beautiful; I salute to the show's directors; they have not disappointed me. The music is also so inspiring.  Chihayafuru truly brings out the beauty of Karuta and the passion with which its characters play.",5
chihayafuru,"I have had a deep love of anime since I watched Princess Mononoke for the very first time when I was around 10 years old, followed immediately by Evangelion which I wasn't even able to conceptualize at that age but still had an awe for.Over the many following years, I have watched anime that have popped up or snatched my interest until recently when I've begun to take interest in not only anime again but Japanese culture in general as I move towards my foreign language major.Chihayafuru was not something I imaged myself ever wanting to watch - having been raised on the likes of Evangelion, Ghost in the Shell, Cowboy Bebop, Trigun and other classics.However, I became a Crunchyroll member after watching SAO and found a desire to support such a nice website and community. After becoming a member I decided I wanted to watch things that others had highly recommended in order to slowly widen my perspective of the genre.Chihayafuru is now among my favorite anime of all time. I never imagined myself getting engrossed into the dialogue and character development as much as I have. Each character is quietly developed or explored through their effort to improve themselves, like pages of a book being slowly turned through each episode.The writers of this anime are quite brilliant - the poems read in each episode often reflecting on each character's inner struggles or goals as a mirror of their self desire as they mature and grow up together playing Karuta.I find the art and animation crisp and uplifting to watch, especially in the more humorous parts when Chihaya is embarrassed or mortified by something. I would recommend this to anyone who isn't sure if they would like it - because before I watched it myself I was in the exact same place.",5
chihayafuru,"Who would've thought that watching an anime about a card game could be so greatChihayafuru is charming and pleasantly heartfelt. What I love about the series besides the fantastic characters is how the storyline unfolds perfectly. There's emphasis on how the characters develop into genuinely interesting and unique personalities. It keeps you in suspense as the characters' romantic overtones and relationships unfold, and entertains you with good humor, and a perfect slice of life without feeling rushed like other series out there. Shows like Chihayafuru is what makes anime worth watching.",5
chihayafuru,"I fell in love with this series in the first few episodes. This series is cheesy, girly, emotional, dramatic, all the good stuff that can make you cry. The music selection is not a huge one but they use them at the perfect times to pull on your hearts' strings.Later in the series, some of it can feel repetitive and the characters don't make much development (Especially episode 16 which you can literally skip) but if you can past that hump, it's still good. The animation is also very smooth and beautiful. They make some animation shortcuts but they are used well.",5
chihayafuru,"The first couple of episodes to Chihayafuru have been beautifully solid and I intend to see this series through.The artwork is lovely, particularly the character designs. The relationships between the main characters and their background stories are relatable and very human. You can really lose yourself in an episode thanks to the steady pace of the storyline. The introduction to the game of Karuta was handled brilliantly. What sounded like a simple card game in the description of the series turned out to be more challenging and intense than expected and I found myself wanting to know more: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KarutaI think this series would be most enjoyed by a 16+ predominantly female audience as it has elements of a mature nature and the stirrings of complicated romances and raw emotion.I look forward to the release of each new episode!",4
chihayafuru,"Chihayafuru is a beautifully drawn, somewhat slower paced, slice-of-life/sports fusion anime. Centering around the competitive card game Karuta, the show skillfully depicts the characters and their changing relationships to both Karuta and each other. The contrast between the main characters' younger and present day selves, and the maturity with which the show treats them provides a character depth that I haven't seen in most anime. However, the show is also chock full of humorous and goofy moments, which provides a nice balance. Additionally, the use of music and sound within the show, especially the reading of the Hundred Poets, adds an element that fans of the manga will appreciate!",5
chihayafuru,"TL;DR: Emotional, sportsy, fun. Kind of slow pace. Worth the watch/stick with it. I did not start Chihayafuru until the very end of the first season. Initially I thought it seemed kind of lame according to the summary. I don't watch ""sports"" animes and this seemed like that. When I started hearing from a lot of people that it was one of the best shows of that season I changed my mind and gave it a chance - I'm very glad I did. Story: 5/5   (Pace: 3/5) Definitely something I've never seen before. It is refreshing to watch something that is not like x number of animes. There's a good mixture of romance, comedy, sport, and SoL/School. The pace is probably the biggest 'issue' of the show. Personally, I don't mind it much. It's rather slow, sometimes a single match lasts multiple episodes. I think part of the reason for the pacing is to not catch up entirely on the manga. Characters: 5/5 I love all the characters. The development, like the pace, is slow. My fondness grew each episode. It may just be that I get emotionally attached easily, but I've come to care a lot for the characters and their well being. Art: 5/5The artwork is beautiful. The fast movements of Karuta appear smooth.",5
chihayafuru,"oh my word where do i even begin???? characters. every single one of them is relevant. doesn't matter how small a part they play, they all have dreams and feelings which the anime makes a point of showing.they are extremely relatable too, dealing with feelings of incompetence and other emotions that we all struggle with.The game itself. Its very intense and exciting and dramatic and its called karuta .yes, you've probably never heard of it *puts hipster glasses on* but thats okay, because they explain it really really well! by the second season you will probably be able to play it yourself (if you can read the cards) animation gorgeous. just gorgeous. its so pretty it makes me want to cry. and the way they use it makes it almost seem magical, just watch when they are playing and and and.... gosh can't even explain it its so awesome.story touching and heartfelt. you will cheer these characters on with all your heart. you cry when they cry, are happy when they are happy, and so on and so forth. there is romance in the story (taichi love forever!) it is important but not the main focus, instead it's weaved in throughout the story.conclusion watch it, thats all i can say, just watch it.add on cause i read some negative reviews, this is a sports anime that is first and foremost about karuta. that's how it is. so they will be playing karuta, talking about karuta, thinking about karuta for most of the anime. character development is not on the very top of the to do list (although there is plenty of it)",5
chihayafuru,"This anime may start out with an incredibly slow pace, but if one sticks with it, it is an amazing series to watch. The best thing about this anime is the fact that it develops over time, especially with each and every one of its large cast of characters. I highly recommend others to watch Chihayafuru for three reasons: the characters, the animation, and the experience of watching karuta itself. All of the characters are very original, unique, and well-written. Whether they are major or minor to the plot, I can assure that nearly EVERY character in this show gets some sort of development. Two standout characters are Taichi and Shinobu, both of whom are complex and interesting to me. I also love the main character, Chihaya, which is an unusual-yet-welcome experience for me.The animation of the show is simply stunning. Rather than cutting back as the show continues over time, the animation rises in quality as the show moves on! The show is filled with bright colors and tranquil scenery. Watching Chihayafuru has really made me want to visit Japan, just because of the beautiful way it paints a picture of its ancient country. This show has also introduced me to a new sport: karuta, an ancient Japanese card game. Karuta is the sole passion of Chihaya, and over the course of the seasons, the viewers are able to watch her develop her skills at it. It is a sport of memorization, strategy, and mental stamina. Each character has seemingly different styles of playing, which is always interesting to watch. The show does a great job of making each match intense and unique from one another. Overall, I give this anime 5/5 stars! I hope to watch a season three!",5
chihayafuru,"I have to admit that when I started to watch this show, I was not expecting it to be this good. Chihayafuru was, maybe (at least for me), the most constantly good show from Oct '11 to March '12 (tied with Mirai Nikki). Chihayafuru does an outstanding job of teaching the viewers the game of ""karuta"", and, more amazingly, it makes it really entertaining. The show gives an excellent written story of drama, comedy, and slice of life, (some art history too) all perfectly balanced. The cast of characters all have their own well-explained backgrounds and unique personalities, while also introducing new characters towards the end which you just know will have an important role in the hopeful second season. The soundtracks get better as the show goes along, as they help set the moods for all the different kinds of situations that the lead characters end up in. Finally, I have to say that this series provided a story that, even though it is still incomplete, has me completely hooked up and counting the days until the next season starts. Hopefully, that day will come soon, this show deserves and should get more attention. Great final episode. Everything does not have to be action in order to entertain. Masterful show for me.Masterpiece95/100.",5
chihayafuru,"When I first noticed this simulcast being added, my interest was in no way piqued. I didn't like the red lettering, or the simple font used for the title in the banner, and the characters didn't look too interesting. Plus, the card at the edge of the banner reminded me of hanafuda cards and I remember trying to play a game with them before and failing miserably at grasping the point of the game.I only checked out Chihayafuru when I was out of options and by chance, one of the screen caps used for an episode preview showed Chihaya looking cuter and more beautiful than usual (at the expense of sounding superficial, which I will admit I am). I am so not sorry that I did. This karuta game is nothing like what I imagined. In fact, I never even thought that a game like this could be played with cards, let alone competitively at a professional sport level. The concept of having to memorize 100 poems and then matching the second verse (printed on the cards) to the first (being read aloud) was so intriguing that I was compelled to watch more and see what strategies the characters will learn to improve, even though having to read the translations of the poems is somewhat distracting from the flow of the anime and the dialogue. I can definitely see this being a huge hit in Japan since the poems and the cards and the mention of the different types of cards can be easily understood by someone with a decent grasp on Japanese.Three or four episodes in, I definitely thought that Chihayafuru is reminisce of ""Hikaru no Go"", which isn't a bad thing at all, in my opinion. I remember loving Hikaru no Go (thought I never watched the anime or finished reading the manga) because I was exposed to a world that I never knew existed, while it actually held a lot of significance. Being educated about foreign culture is always interesting, especially when you get to see the very different type of skill sets and amount of talent required to become masterful at these mentally (and in karuta's case, physically also) challenging games. You get to see a type of amazing that has been hidden away, like discovering a treasure that was there all along.I love the art style, too. The way the eyes are given such beautiful and natural looking colours along with depth, the way petals are animated, the picturesque nature scenes, and the cloth patterns in Kana-chan's kimono shop! So breath taking! The animators really know how to place emphasis where it's due! Character design art wise is also very good. Always love the way Chihaya is drawn, child and teen versions.Music is pretty fabulous as well. Both the opening and ending themes suit the anime really well, especially the ending. Really compliments the classical poems. Background music sets the mood well, and I like how they always use the ""swish"" sound effect whenever players grab for cards. It really helps emphasize the speed needed for the game. Really makes it exciting.I like all the characters, but I don't know if it's because I'm jealous or something, I definitely like the two boy characters much more than Chihaya Ayase. She has all the perfect qualities to be the heroine, and she redeems herself every time by realizing her mistakes, but there is just something about her that gets on my nerves sometimes. Maybe it's her unrealistic commitment to the game, maybe it's her unfounded stubbornness, or maybe it's just because I don't understand why these two great guys are fixated on her, while she's so dense about romance, it's like even Superman wouldn't be able to see through her with his X-ray vision. Her best quality, in my opinion, however, is that she has a strong sense of righteousness and equality. In the end, when she forms the karuta club she doesn't care about appearance or popularity or perks. She rallies in a mixed bag of misfits and you can tell that later on, they will all be extremely grateful to her for it. I'm sure her unbiased nature is also what attracts Taichi and Arata to her.As riveting as the karuta games are, and also their journey to greatness, I have to say I think I might be watching this anime for the love triangle between Chihaya, Taichi and Arata. I'm almost certain that it is only Chihaya who doesn't realize this is going on, but I love the way it's going so far at episode 10. The romance side of the plot is progressing and I imagine Chihaya's realization of her romantic feelings will only make her a better player at karuta. I'm really glad I gave Chihayafuru a shot, because it is beautifully written and animated, and I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a good romance or sports/game anime. Both the karuta and the love triangle compliment each other and make it more interesting and compelling overall.Last comment: The reason why it is titled Chihayafuru is by far one of the best titles and explanations I have ever seen/heard. Smart, sweet, meaningful, and romantic is a wonderful combination as characteristics for any kind of title!",5
chihayafuru,"I admit, I was compelled to join those who had written a review after first episode or two.  However, I felt that it would not do the series justice by writing one so early and having to revise it a few times.  Now that at the time of this review, the eleventh episode was released for subscription members.  I feel that I can give a better opinion than if I wrote one on the first episode or two.  Initially what brought me to Chihayafuru wasn't an interest in the card game, or the poems themselves.  It was the animation quality that I had witnessed in the first episode.  It wasn't until after I had watched the first episode that I had that urge to watch more, and so I waited.  I waited until more released, that gave way when episode six was released.  Since then, I've joined many who wait week by week for the new episodes to come by.As a tournament/sport style series, I was surprised by the amount of heart that's put into the characters.  I was a bit cautious about giving the story a five, but now that so many episodes has passed by, I feel that this is what it deserves.  As Chihaya grabbed more members for a karuta club for her school.  While I found Chihaya's character to be a bit unrealistic even during the childhood scenes.  It wasn't in a bad way.  It works in the way that she interacts with everyone around her.  Chihaya is definitely the spice that makes everyone in the series work.  Without her, they all seem a little bland.The music is largely background and complimentary music, the opening and ending sequences are nice pieces.  While there's not much I can say about it, when it comes in, it definitely adds a good feeling to the scenes.The animation quality is clean and sharp.  The only times I noticed drops in quality isn't during the quick movements during the karuta games, or the background scenes of the city, countryside, or in a train.  It's during the scenes that have exaggerated faces which are intended to look the way they were.  That's the only downside.  The way the cards were soaked up by water after they fell in a puddle, the way tears started to well up.  The small moments are excellently animated and it's hard to spot any flaws.With almost half the series watched, and another half to look forward to.  I can only imagine how this will end.  If it continues this pace, this can easily become one of my favorites series, and so far has become my favorite series of 2011.  In this fan's eyes, it's not Christmas that I look forward to, or the New Years.  It's the upcoming episodes of Chihayafuru that I've constantly looked forward to week after week.  As I long for, or rather escape the idea of a conclusion.  I can imagine the thoughts I put forth for this review won't change much, and if any it could only praise the series more.  I only hope for a conclusion that can work well for a manga series that's ongoing.",5
chihayafuru,"I watched this anime to of curiosity,, because I like poems I got deeply attached  with the story as well, like Chihaya (the heroin) fell in love with Arata since they were young because of the game. Little did she know that his other childhood friend, tai chi is in love with her and is doing his best to match up with Arata's skills just so Chihaya would notice him. On top of that, this anime made playing Karuta  exciting, how the poems are related to their relations and so on.",5
chihayafuru,"This series really defines what a good anime should be like. It is based off a very old card game called Karuta where the object is to steal cards placed between two players. Sound boring? It is anything but that. It is so intense and the manner in which they progress the matched and the interactions is so well done I can't imagine anyone not enjoying it. Its very funny too! Lots of characters but its so easy to keep track of everyone cause they all exhibit such personality.Butterflies in my stomach the anxiety will overtake you. Biggest let down is when the credits role. Sun of a---!If you like game play animes like ""Hikaru no Go"" this one is for you!Just a warning though at 50 episodes the series doesn't technically end and can still continue so you may have to finish by reading the manga unless they come out with more later! Still very worth viewing though.",5
chihayafuru,"This show was good in a awkward kind of way. Chihaya is very airheaded, but she has the determination of a bull LOL. I LOVE TAICHI !!!!!!!!!!!!!! everybody is saying who they want to go together. like taichi or chihaya or arata and chihaya. For me it would definetly be taichi and chihaya. They've known each other for the longest and they have more chemistry, well to taichi they do. its kind of a one sided love. she just don't notice how he feels about her. Enough of me rambling on and on LOL. I would reccomend this show to everyone!!!!",4.5
chihayafuru,"This may be one of the best slice of life ""let's make a high school club!"" anime that I've ever seen.  It took me a long time to dredge up the motivation to start an anime that is about a niche Japanese card game that I've never played and will never play, but this one is really about the characters first and foremost.  The game in question has simple enough rules that I can easily follow what's going on, and coupled with unique likable characters, I really get the feeling while watching it of a coming of age sports movie.  The show has it's weak points:  Some boring episodes with an over-emphasis on the Karuta, and some of the relationships between the characters gets a little stale after a while.All in all though I really liked this one and I would happily recommend it to just about anyone who appreciates slice of life anime.  I'm looking forward to season 2 in January.",4.5
chihayafuru,"I generally avoid animes that are about board games, cards, or ""sports"" because they generally focus so much on the games/sports that the characterization and drama are totally left out, aside from ""game drama"". By this, I mean that all of the ""draw"" of these sorts of animes is ""who's going to win!?"". That... gets boring after an episode or two... but this anime, was out of this world!!!I'd never heard of Karuta before this, and when I looked it up, I realized it's very rare outside of Japan... but gosh this made me want to play it! The characters were captivating, and you could clearly feel every step of the way with them. When someone lost, or won, or had a turning point, you felt it too! It's very rare for me to get worked into an anime like this, let alone stay up all night to finish the series. In fact, I enjoyed it so much, I instantly went looking to see if there was a second season, which has apparently been announced! I cannot WAIT! This is definitely an anime I'd recommend, regardless of your tastes. It'll definitely be a new, refreshing experience. : )",4.5
chihayafuru,"What originally drew me to this anime was it's stunning art style, especially in it's coloring. I first came across it a Taichi x Chihaya amv. The amv didn't show any clips of the main premise of the show, the card game Karuta, so when I started it I was surprised. I thought this was going to be just another shoujo school love story, but it's more than that. The love tones of the story are very prevalent, but not suffocating. They're not the main interest. This show has wonderful moral applications about determination through failure and through victory. It has real life reactions to things, real pain, real loss, and real joy. It has good role models of both genders in different types of situations, you can find something to relate to in all of them. Chihayafuru teaches never to give up on your dreams, no matter how hard they seem or how long it takes, they are always reachable if you never let go of your passion.",4.5
chihayafuru,"To think that I almost didn't watch this. I was turned off when I read it was about a card game. But something compelled me to try it, and I'm so glad I did!Although the story is a bit predictable, it's realistic enough that you can connect to the characters, and extraordinary enough to keep things interesting.This series is so rich in culture. If you look up karuta on YouTube, you'll see so many Chihayafuru fans that went to look it up. Great exposure. And the characters' passion for the game and the poems made me look up the poems to read myself.It's a fun, smart, and endearing series. -YubochiThis pretty much was what I was about to say, haha. Chihayafuru is a very beautiful, original, piece of work and I will be buying this box set once it comes out to show my support for its creators.",4.5

chihayafuru,"Hyakunin-isshu which is called Karta is a quite new theme for anime, I think. So, Chihaya started hyakunin-isshu after she met Wataya? I wonder what happend to Wataya, he didn't return a greeting card of new year.  Hyakunin-isshu is called Karta in this anime. Players try to get cards which have half part of Tanka, most of them are from Kokin waka-shu, that was treated as a text book of Tanka (Old poem which has 5 7 5 7 7 sounds).  In this game, players don't have to understand what these tanka mean.As Ooe kanade said in Episode 6, Hyakunin Isshu were tankas Fujiwara Teika selected and they have translations in many ways. Yes, ""Chihayafuru......."" is a poem of burning love. I like this.",5
chihayafuru,"I was honestly so surprised how much I got into this anime. I'm really big on having major progression in the romantic aspects, but for some reason I was way more excited on the  growth of them playing karuta. I'm super happy I started this now and not back in 2013 like some of the people in the comments since it's apparently coming back next month. JUST IN TIME FOR MY BIRTHDAY. Reply to me if you have any recommendations for me to watch. Ill accept all even if I've seen them. Ty",5
chihayafuru,"I don't usually go for a sports anime and when I have, I rarely finish them. However, this anime was extraordinary in all aspects. It had an absolutely beautiful art style and the way they do everyone's eyes really draws you in. All the characters were very unique in their own ways. I really like how all the characters took the time to build everyone else up and give them the courage to do anything that they desired. The sport of this anime; Competitive Karuta, was and is a very intense and captivating game. It really inspired me to want to try a martial art or to even learn this game myself. The rules, the 100 poems, as well as the meanings behind the poems was extremely fascinating to me. This anime will have you more intrigued than any other sports anime out there. I truly hope that you will take the time to watch this, in my opinion it is well worth the watch.",5
chihayafuru,"Chihayafuru starts to tell a story of three friends raising to become amongst the best Karuta players but along the way more players are joining with the teens. The protagonist Chihaya Ayase is a girl who met talented Karuta player Arata Wataya and was inspired to start playing it as well with her friends. One of the best things I liked about it is the plot that makes characters grow so much. At the end of the second season, everyone has already grown into a whole new person in a good way. I like the role Chihaya has, which is to motivate everyone else and herself to become better at the game. I think we all could learn from her a few things. Finally, let's get to the Karuta. I am so impressed by how well the animation of the hands and cards flying is made. The whole sport is made into super intensive and every match is a struggle to win. I love how the players analyze the game and actually show the struggle they are having. Before this show, I didn't even know that so cool sport called Karuta existed. The show still teaches you everything so well that it's easy for you to get into the world of Karuta. I would absolutely encourage everyone to watch the series for several reasons, which the important ones are the fact that it teaches you amazing sports Karuta and it's really good motivational show that says's you should always chase your dreams cause if you want them hard enough they can come true. Only sad part is that the show ends pretty unfinished and sadly we probably never get a new season to finish the story what manga had.",5
chihayafuru,"This anime is one of the best animes I have ever watched.I have nothing, but praise. Chihayafuru is an anime everyone should watch. This is the only anime I have reviewed on CR, so that says something about the quality of this one. The animation is beautiful and the pacing is solid. It is emotional. Everything is perfect. This deserves to the called a masterpiecec. Too bad the manga probably will never be published in NA/in english.",5
chihayafuru,"This is, in my humble opinion, a true masterpiece. I am a lover of romantic anime; and, while romance wasn't necessarily a central theme it was definitely there. This was something entirely different, and fresh. I'm so pleased that so many other people share my sentiment. The protagonist was so vibrant, and vivacious it was hard not to have liked her character. I also found myself liking all of the characters in the anime, not just the lead. I hope that a third season is around the corner. This anime has earned my personal recommendation.",5
chihayafuru,I want to by the manga if i can find it.   This show is a great show to watch 3-4 episodes at a time if you do more you'll get burnt out on it. It needs another season but one thing that bothers me the most is that a lot of shows like this like to do a recap of the last half of the previous episode that takes up most of the new one.  also full recaps of the season up into episode 13 or 14 i can't remember are annoying.  Other than that this show is great and worth the time to watch. Great character development and lovable back story for even the non main characters.,5
chihayafuru,"I wasn't sure what to expect out of this at first but after watching the first few episodes I was completely blown away. I never knew Karuta existed until I started watching this anime! Since Chihayafuru2 ended (missing one bonus episode btw!) I've started reading the manga. I'm pretty sure the anime was to promote the manga anyway, so I'm not entirely sure if there will be another season... regardless, it's a great show and I'm proud to say it's in my top 10 favourite animes! It's even got me interested in playing Karuta!Romance, comedy, drama and it occasionally pulls on your heart strings (in all different ways). Must watch! Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideDef rooting for Chihaya to realize Taichi's feelings, but the manga kind of has shifted gears in regards to Arata's confession.",5
chihayafuru,"This anime is marvelous, you would not expect a card game to be so intense let alone make such a grand show! The protagonist is strong and well developed she does not start off as a weak character on the contrary she is a motivated girl with a love of karuta. the other characters do not fall on the wayside her childhood buddy's show massive growth throughout both seasons especially Taichi.Each episode left me wanting more the art work and score also assisted in that. I would recommend this anime any day, it reminds me if Hikaru no Go.",5
chihayafuru,"Chihayafuru is about Chihaya a girl with no talents and nothing to do. She feels sorry for Arata a classmate. They discover a beautifully addicting card game together. This is unexpectedly good! Why? I'm not really sure. The animation is amazing, the story is easy to follow and interesting. But why it stands out? If I had to ""show my hand"" it's the card game! The game is astonishingly cool, and when I watch this it makes me want to play it! To add to the shows emotional complexity this show is about bullying, a big problem in all countries, especially China and Japan. It's good to learn about this, and that it's a very dangerous thing, if you watch Chihya you should compliment it with the documentary ""Please Vote for Me"" about this same topic.",5
chihayafuru,"Chihayafuru follows the story of a girl named Chihaya Ayase who is obsessed with the Japanese traditional game, karuta. After meeting a boy named Wataya Arata in her childhood who introduces her to karuta, her dream from then on is nothing less than to become the best in the world.My opinion: Before I watched this anime, I suspected it would be a cliche, typical and bland shojo anime... But boy was I wrong! Chihayafuru is a thrilling anime that will make you want to keep watching until the very end. 9.1/10The art: The animation was amazing in Chihayafuru (Especially in the match scenes) The art style was average... However, the incredible texture they used really made up for it. 8.1/10The music: The music was average, there was some music that didn't quite fit, however... There was also some incredible music which extended the art of the anime with grace and tension. 7.1/10The characters: I loved the characters, they differed from the strong characters to the ones that needed a push. I love how each character had a different personality and style and that was wonderfully portrayed in their karuta playing styles. 8.1/10Overall: I really enjoyed this anime, it made me see karuta in a whole new light while putting me into the position of someone who is valiant and determined to work to their goals, it's a truly inspiring anime and made me want to someday play karuta for myself... I'm hoping there will be a season 3. 8.8/10Genres: Romance, Shojo, Comedy, Sport, Action, Slice of Life",5
chihayafuru,"This anime sat in my Q for the longest time. It didn't catch fire for me until the third episode of the first season and then I was hooked. The characters are all very appealing, especially Chihaya, whose passion and desire to play Karuta and be with her friends is truly inspiring. Still, there's something sad about her that I can't quite put my finger on yet. She needs an outlet for her love, which seems to be overflowing at times and I hope she finds what she's looking for. So let's hope the story continues to grow along with the characters. I'm pulling for Taichi and Chihaya getting together.",5
chihayafuru,"After watching this show, I can truly say the you get attached to these characters. It's well written and has emotion to it. The determination shown by the characters for this one sport makes it feel like the effort put into something really matters. The feeling of striving to succeed and the hurt in losing, this is something everyone can relate too... I had never hear of Karuta before however if the show were to have been base on any other sport I think it would be a little lost. Even though Karuta seems to be a game played with an opponent, you still get a sense of teamwork. They help each other grow stronger by using their strengths and knowledge which is why I find it so interesting. I liked that the characters stay consistent yet still manage to improve. I hope to see this show continued.",5
chihayafuru,I just finished watching the animer series and I would have to say that it was truely a pleasure this series. I wish I have had such a passion for something in my early youth. I always love watching anime series like these that gives a person some insight that there is always something beautiful in the world to do besides trying to figure your everyday struggles. I would recommend it to anyone in viewing this series!!!!!,5
chihayafuru,"I watched this only because I read the manga series first. I was a bit scared because I don't really like game manga in the first place but, this actually was GOOD. I liked the manga series but it didn't have the animation that I yearned to see. Karuta is a card game which involves your hand moving to hit a card. Obviously, manga will not demonstrate this action. So I downloaded the first couple of episodes and started watching. I recommend this to anyone who wants a refreshing series with a bit of romance, lots of friendship, slice of life and if you wanna learn something new!Storyline:I'd say it's really good. There is too much karuta in my opinion. Just a bit too much. I would probably rate it higher if we had a bit more balance.Music:Great OST, great OP, pretty good ED. Pretty much.Characters:Amazing actually. They're all special and great in their own way.Animation:Awesome. It's just awesome. xD",5
chihayafuru,"Chihayafuru is a stellar and emotionally engaging anime based on the popular Japanese game Karuta. The characters are warm, unique and memorable which is only aided by the wonderful voice work and animation. The voice work of Chihaya and Taichi in particular shine for the cast and the beautiful animation, especially the cg scenes, add to the fluidity of the competitions in the show, while the comedic breaks and hinted romantic subplots are welcome and add to the depth and appeal of each character. The final personal delight of mine is the connection attempted to bridge poetry to a competitive sport which makes Chihayafuru feel first unique in a ""sport anime genre"" while remaining culturally specific to Japan. Wonderful. I only hope a second season will be followed!",5
chihayafuru,"Chihayafuru is a short series telling the story of Chihaya and her friends.On the surface one would assume it's a Sports themed anime, but it's not so much about the Karuta, it's more about the connections between the characters and their devotion to what they do.It's wonderfully realized artistically and has excellent pacing throughout.It's largely the cast of characters that bring this show to life, and the variety of emotions the show is able to stir within you.I really hope to see a second series one day in the future, there are lots of plots points that can continue (just like in real life) but I'd be happy with this bitter sweet ending too, the creators have left enough there for you to imagine your own ending!Chihayafuru comes highly recommended from meI believe the characters are the strongest single element that Chihayafuru offers, and so that is reflected in my 'overall' score alsoA+",5
chihayafuru,"Not sure why I started this. It looked like it would be boring. A whole anime about a card game that children play? That kind of thing really only lasts half a season but nope, after two seasons, why not wait six years to do the third season?Anyway, after a two day binge, I couldn't get enough. 2 whole seasons and 9 episodes in, we're not even half way through the manga. Also, Hanano-chan needs her own spin-off series.Man... where do we get Snowmaru merchandise? Where?",5
chihayafuru,"You might have been thinking of passing this up.  You looked at the description, you looked at the artwork and probably thought this had to be one of those silly shoujo romances that you're not into where the premise is a vague afterthought.Well, I'm here to tell you that it is not.This is an anime about COMPETITIVE GAMING, and it is glorious.The game is a very Japanese card game called ""karuta,"" and before watching this anime you'd be forgiven for not knowing what that is.  I'm not going to spoil it for you, because learning about ""karuta"" is a large part of the fun of the anime.  What I will say is that I have been a competitive gamer for over a decade and that's where Chihayafuru strikes a chord with me.  That is where it absolutely shines.The way it represents all aspects of competition in a stationary game is so straightforward, it's refreshing.  It doesn't patronize the viewers by turning matches into representations of other fantasies (like, say, Food Wars with its extended metaphors for taste).  Instead, it shows each and every moment of a match in excruciating detail, and the intensity is breathtaking.  Throughout the story it gets into themes of preparedness, ability, mindgames, endurance, perception, technique, knowledge, ritual... and treats them all with such respect that you can't help but learn.Of course that's not all there is to it.  It has likable characters, humor, legit wisdom, beautiful visuals, and is accompanied by an epic soundtrack.  And yes, although it's not the main premise, it does have hints of romance in there.So give it a shot, especially if you've ever enjoyed a competition or two.  It's worth it.",5
chihayafuru,"I started watching anime several years ago and have many series that I have loved during that time.  I have no set art style, genre, or story line that I prefer.  However, Chihayafuru is the first anime that I have ever written a review about.  In short, it is because I feel driven to do so. I think Chihayafuru has the effect like anything that is extremely well done.  Like an amazing feat of architecture, athleticism, vehicular design, musicality, or anything else invoking skill.  When it is a masterpiece it doesn't matter whether individuals are highly interested in the subject or not - they will still take note and marvel.As proven by all the other ratings and reviews of this show - I think just about anyone could watch and enjoy this anime because it is just that good.To the writers, artists, and producers involved in this manga and anime - please keep striving ahead with excellence!",5
chihayafuru,This had me on the edge of my seat and binge watching non stop! It definitely surprised me as I wouldn't of thought to watch this but I completely love this anime. I have seen there are live action movies of this so Im definitely going to watch those next! I have never heard of this card game and it has been turned into something beautiful and exciting. Love all the characters and I hope she realises who has been there the whole time for her!,5
chihayafuru,"I fell in love with karuta because of this show! The character development is really beautiful and the way they set up the story line to go back and show the past is very well written! I really relate to Chihaya and her dedication and passion to the art of the game. Her willingness to keep pushing herself and her desire to grow, change, and become stronger is very inspiring!! I hope they continue this show as I would love to see more matches as Chihaya and Taichi continue to excel! I'm excited for Chihaya to finally play a match against Arata!! Much love for the creators, writers and producers of this show! Please keep it going! ❣️",5
chihayafuru,"How to explain this series ?                 Ayase the herione or team ace cries half the series , can't figure out taichi is crazy about her and obsesses over a guy that ends up being a emotionally detached elitist jerk after his grandpa dies for 50 episodes . oh and they play an easy to understand but insanely difficult to master game, with seriously intense moments. I've watched alot of anime and this is  the first anime series I've hated the lead character and loved her almost episode by episode. The secondary characters keep the story going. The three main characters the first being Arata is hardly in the first 50 episodes, the other two ayase and taichi are in every episode but  make about 0% overall personal growth whilst improving their game until the last couple of episodes.          which is why to me anyway it felt like OE a female side character effortlessly steals the show.hard to tell if she was suppose to be the center of the story in initial drafts or is just someone reminisce of the author or the authors friend but she gets the most realistically weird lines, reactions and seems to be involved during every key point of the story and is the only one you see  steadily grow in and out of the game, she starts as a quite poet obsessed novice and by the end of the second season is the den mother of the team , she cares for the rookies and pushes the veterans to grow whilst given cultural significance to the playing pieces. :) I can't wait for season 3",5
chihayafuru,I went in to this show expecting to be a show which is just another sports/games anime just for making it because the game exists but then when you watch the first few episodes you just get hooked and then the next thing you know is that you are on the final episodes. I got hooked so much on this show I am going to start my 3rd watch through. The reason I writing this review is because chihafuru has got 3rd season coming out and even with 4th season of my hero coming this is my most anticipated anime of this year. Also this show is the show that really got me into anime because before this I had I had only watch Fullmetal alchemist and Blue exorcist. which are both brilliant anime but this really brought me into watch any anime I feel is interesting.,5
chihayafuru,"The competitive Japanese card game karuta, a physically and mentally demanding card game inspired by the classic Japanese anthology of Hundred Poets. Our story primarily focuses around the karuta club of Mizusawa High, and it's founding member Chihaya Ayase. With an overwhelming love for the game, Chihaya aims to become the Queen, the best female player in Japan, and since the game is for the most part only played in Japan, she would essentially be the best female player in the world. She is not alone in her attempt to achieve her dream, with teammates and rivals all around her, the journey to become the next Queen will be much more complicated than she could even imagine.Chihayafuru is better than it has any right to be, that's not to say we don't have niche competitive game anime, March Come in Like a Lion is the easiest comparison to make, and that anime is pretty legendary. While I do prefer that one rather than Chihayafuru, Chihayafuru is still surprisingly amazing. Every single character is well thought out and equally well written to help tell the story and help our main group learn to improve their karuta skill. The anime is also incredibly dedicated to showing as much karuta as possible, I don't think a single episode went by that didn't involve karuta in some way, which in a way is Chihayafuru's biggest strength. It's characters coupled with a great style and animation quality that manages to make simple motions exciting and outcomes sweat inducing. Altogether they craft a competitive sports anime that will have you cheering on each match till the end.",5
chihayafuru,"If you cared enough and is interested enough to be reading... GO WATCH THIS SHOW PLEASE.This is simply one of the best animes I have ever encountered, and definitely one that never fails to make me enjoy every moment the story even after numerous rewatches. The cast contains a wide range of unique and memorable characters who are all realistic but lovable in their own ways.While being part of the ""shojo"" genre, Chihayafuru nevertheless more closely resembles a shonen sports manga/anime; at the same time, with the delicate addition of separate emotional arcs for many characters, viewers also get to have a more complete perspective of these fascinating individuals beyond their passion and devotion in the sport--focusing more on their different ideologies. This is perhaps the reason why I deeply root for many of the characters in this show, as I consider the story to be ultimately character-driven. In the end, I would not mind even if they did not become the ""best players in the nation,"" because the true greatness of the show lies in the overlapping arcs of each character as they influence and inspire each other to grow and change.P.S. I ship Arata x Chihaya... It's a shame that the manga's story(not in the anime) has headed towards a disappointing direction that spoils all the greatness the author has intricately developed in the previous storylines...",5
chihayafuru,"The anime really has a way to capture your eye, its beautiful art and how they can actually make a card game really exciting. Ever since episode 1, I was hooked and needed more. It is one of the few animes that captures my attention even if I rewatch it a thousand times. The whole anime is so amazingly done and I wish there were more animes like this one that was as good as this one. Not about the card game but how the character expresses themselves, the plot, the development and how people can get better by trying. It gives you confidence and hope. I really love how they made the card game really exciting too, it's really amazing! (I am not English, so please bear with my grammar or how I spelled sentences wrong lol)",5
chihayafuru,The show follows a young girl named Chihaya start a karuta club at her highschool with the help of her childhood friend Taichi. We get to explore how the popularity this game fluctuates from school to school and the different levels of dedication from its players. We see different techniques to play the game and the hierarchy in their societies (local community clubs).I really enjoy learning about the 100 poems and their meanings. I love learning about how the game is played and how tension is well portrayed between teams.Its an amazing show and hope more seasons will be created!,5
chihayafuru,"I wasn't sure how they were going to have a show that 2 seasons long with this premise, but now I want MORE!!!  This was an amazing show.  Yes, there was a lot about karuta, but they still fit everything else in there too.  Comedy, romance, drama, suspense.  The competition scenes really do drag you in and make you feel tense!  I was not expecting all that from this show, but this is in my top 10 now.",5
chihayafuru,"So you ask “What’s karuta?”Well, it’s a Japanese card game. And if it weren’t for this extremely well done series, you would never get excited about it. Yet here we are. 52 episodes later and I’m dying for more matches!One thing that this anime does better than most is making you fall in love with the characters. Before you know it, you care so much about every single one of the main characters. This series does a great job of using flashbacks to teach you about everyone’s back story. But they don’t overdo it like some others do. The flashbacks are well timed and they don’t drag on forever. You even learn just enough about the main characters rivals to get you personally involved with their matches.There’s almost no wasted episodes. A lot of series that are based on matches or battles or some kind of competition draw everything out. It seems like the writers realized that nobody really wants to watch a long drawn out training arc. In most cases the only reason we do is because we’re already invested in the series. But they don’t take advantage of that. They skip months of unnecessary training and get you right to the meat of the story. In only 52 episodes they cover 2 entire years of progress.When you start the first episode, you’d never think that you’d have all of your emotions tested. That is definitely the case though. You quickly become emotionally invested in all of the main characters. They time the music perfectly with all the important scenes. And next thing you know, you’re sitting there with tears of joy in your eyes as your favorite character has an incredible breakthrough. You also will find yourself on the edge of your seat stressed out about the outcome of the match you’re watching. And of course the overwhelming frustration when things take a turn and don’t go how you were wishing they would.They’ve got jokes too. This isn’t a serious series the entire time. The writers have very well placed jokes to break the tension. Sometimes that’s exactly what you need. Otherwise you might go crazy cheering and yelling at the TV for hours like a crazed sports fan.My only real complaint about this series is that they sometimes draw out an episode with the same flashback clips that you’ve seen a couple times before. It seems like they are just killing a few minutes so they can end on a cliff hanger. This doesn’t happen too often, so it’s not a huge issue. The flashback repeats are mostly when they are approaching an important match with a reoccurring character. You have to keep in mind that they had originally intended you to watch an episode a week, not a handful back to back on consecutive days. So it might not have even been noticeable when it was originally airing During a binge watching marathon you come to be familiar with them.Overall I would recommend Chihayafuru to everyone. I’ve probably watched it 5 times by now and am still waiting patiently for a third season to start. They leave it on a big time cliff hanger on the last episode of season 2, so there has to be a third in the works somewhere. Or at least that’s what I’ll keep telling myself as I check what series are scheduled to air every TV season.For more reviews please visit my page www.medium.com/@animedave",5
chihayafuru,"When I heard the director of Cardcaptor Sakura was working on another show that itself was enough to get me to watch, However it would be unfair to this show to simply call it ""the other show he worked on with Madhouse"" because Chihayafuru is so much more. Throughout its 2 season run the characters come alive in a way that instantly makes you love them and want to root for them. Chihaya is a character who at first seems like every other sports protagonist you've seen, perfect at everything and a sevant. However as the show progresses and we get more of her origins and backstory we see what makes her such an endearing character, she's full of tenacity and spirit and always is working on improving herself, and she's not alone in that trait. Characters such as her best friend Taichi could easily carry his own show and at points really feels like he's the character we are meant to wanna root for more so than even Chihaya herself, his development over the course of 2 seasons is amazing and has really endeared him to me as I'm sure he will others. Other supporting members of the cast all get great moments to show why they love Karuta and the show itself does a magnificent job of explains the rules of the game and helping convey why it is such an important part of these characters lives. Through the shows use of mood through its poems and making them truly come alive they instill a sense of awe in the viewer that sucks them up into the world of Karuta in the same its characters get into it. Madhouse really did a superb job on the animation and music of this series and I would dare say call it one of there best works, overall i'd say if you haven't tried this show yet I can't recommend it enough, you'll find not only a great cast of likable characters with great competitive matches but also a gateway into a world of beautiful Japanese poetry and how those poems can be related to even to this day.",5
chihayafuru,"This anime really intrigued me so very much! It was one of first watched, but I am constantly failing in finding something to top it. 1. I love the MC's personality. Chihaya is such a lively, passionate, kind and dedicated person. Her character really inspires me throughout the show, making me laugh and cry, because I can literally relate to her passion through the show, that's how strong her emotions are. She is still a child at heart and I love to follow how she grows from being so innocent and naive. Her animation is beautiful too, of course.2. My OTP (one true pairing) kept on changing! I could not decide who between Taichi and Arata I ship with Chihaya! That really prickled my curiosity, because usually I am dead set on an OTP when a love triangle comes into play. It played with my heart and messed with my emotions, but it was wonderful to, for once, really like both the love-interests. It causes inner-conflictions within myself and I found it really entertaining! (Although, I finally have my solid OTP.)3. Some anime tend to fail in this aspect, but Chihayafuru got it spot on. I really grew fond of each and every side-character. I wouldn't mind if the centre of the episode shifts to any character, because the show has succeeded in making me interested in them. This keeps the show really entertaining and I loved it!4. Karuta. The strangest card game that my wildest imagination never would be able to create, but I absolutely love it! I was so immersed in every game and I feel as if I personally become better with every game Chihaya and her friends play. I never thought I would wish that much to want to speak Japanese. To be able to play it myself and to, of course, wear a kimono while playing, at Kana-chan's request. The karuta really gets intense and keeps you on the edge of you seat.This show captured my heart, interest and time. The OP and end songs are beautiful and the emotional rollercoaster with Mizusawa is indescribable. I hope you love Chihayafuru as much as I did.",5

fairy-tail,"I've watched plenty of top quality animes, and Fairy Tail will always rank in the top ten of my favorites.  Fairy Tail is a long running anime that never leaves you disappointed.The story takes place in the region of Fiore.  In this area people use magic for everything.  The story revolves around the people in the guild, Fairy Tail.  Primarily it focuses on Lucy Heartifilia, Natsu Dragneel, Gray Fullbuster, and Erza Scarlet.  Later, other characters are introduced or become more important, but I'm focusing on the original four.  The protagonist is Natsu, when he was a child he was taken in and raised by a dragon, Igneel, and taught how to use Fire Dragon Slayer magic.  This allows him to manifest flames from his body and beat you to death if you piss him off or hurt his friends.  He can be silly at times and quite fierce when upset.  He's not the protagonist that cries and runs off when times get tough.  He fights and never gives up, even if that means he could die.  Lucy is the leading female protagonist.  She plays a bit under the stereotypical damsel in distress role, but she can defend herself against weaker (or stupider) opponents.  She is typically a product of fanservice, usually against her will.  She has the ability to summon Celestial Beings to fight for her because she has made a contract with them.  At the start of the show she is not very strong at all, but she becomes stronger over the course of time.  (Example:  Before she could not call out more than one Celestial Being at a time, nor switch between them.  Eventually she can switch between several and she can have two out at the same time.)  Gray Fullbuster is an Ice Make wizard; so basically he can create weapons out of ice and fight with them.  He has a lot of back story that ties in with the main plot and one of my favorite characters.  He has a fierce rivalry with Natsu, and a bad habit of stripping all of his clothes off unconsciously.  Erza is described as the most powerful female in Fairy Tail  (the guild that is), and has a very stern personality.  She had a past of being enslaved, and having to labor for, worshippers of Zeref, an ancient wizard capable of the most powerful types of evil.  She usually puts Natsu and Gray in their place when they fight.The music is very fitting and powerful.  I recommend looking up a few of the songs.  You won't be disappointed.  The animation was very good even before they smooth it out for the continuation.  As I can see from the preview it looks better than most movie animations.  Fanservice is very obvious in this show, and there is practically cleavage in every episode.  Some people say it is excessive, even to the point of annoying, but I say that it is just a part of the show and I have no complaints.  There is a balanced amount of comedy and comedic foils in the show so you're not over-tensed by the plotline.  Character development is amazing for some characters and a little lacking for others.  Overall, I says you will get your fair share of feels, laughs, cries, and fanservice.  I absolutely recommend watching this.  If you haven't already, you should look around for the previous episodes; hopefully Crunchyroll will pick them up eventually.",5
fairy-tail,"Before you fan boys down vote this instantly because I gave 3 stars, please consider reading before you ACTUALLY vote this.I've watched a lot of episodes and I'm glad they're back but it gets boring after awhile.Its the same thing over and over again like""Oh we will never be able to defeat them""""Oh no! I can't let Lucy, fairy tail etc. down!""""I have to beat them! But they are too strong""""maybe If we bond together we can beat them!""""We Beat them with the power of Friendship and bond!""Then happy peaceful lives Suddenly....""Oh No a threat appeared...time to repeat process..""and so on and so on, its fun for awhile but it gets boring and repetitive.",5
fairy-tail,"This review is meant for the mature crowd.  Those of you whom appreciate over the top slapstick tropes, plot devices and the like will not see the sense in this review.Fairy Tail is at best a mediocre anime.  It provides for a very repetitive and formulaic format for every story arc.  Tropes, cliches, and plot devices are mercilessly used in this anime.  Every time the protagonists encounter resistance they are quickly and easily dispatched as the enemy just leaves them for dead or whatever.  The protagonists just moan a little, lick their wounds, and rebound through some plot device or cliche.  Even the impressively powerful guild master somehow experiences defeat at the beginning of every confrontation only to recover and return later if his brood has not managed to succeed without him.Every adult character in this anime has a serious lack of maturity.  Senior members of the guild are regularly out of the picture as the junior members do most to almost all of the heavy lifting.  At first the senior members only appear to make trouble for their own guild, where they are whipped into shape by their subordinates.This anime has a very incongruous way of dealing with the protagonists powers and abilities. For some reason they are not considered S-Class Wizards despite repeatedly confronting and overcoming several other S-Class Wizards, quests, and guild leaders.  Any powers that are learned or displayed near the end of a story arc are forgotten or weakened again at the beginning of the next where they return to being simpleton protagonists with something to prove.Any Protagonist with a weakness, like Natsu's motion sickness, is overplayed to painful slapstick extremes.  Despite what appears to be limited and formulaic poorly developed story elements, Fair Tail still seems to be able to deliver surprisingly touching moments and some level of satisfaction as they pull through their predicaments.Attack on Titan, Hunter x Hunter, and Log Horizon are superior animes in nearly every respect when compared to this one.",5
fairy-tail,"To say i love this show is a understatementI watched the 1st series of this show and i fell in love il be honest the Plot isn't the greatest thing you will see, the Arcs are not the best BUT the feel of this show just gives you the most amazing feeling! This is mostly because of how subversive the world of Fairy Tail is, plus the music! the music is incredible! if you are a fan of good feeling anime THIS IS A MUST WATCH! For this series the animation has increased 10 fold, the overall show just looks darker and grittier and that is what this show needed! one of my personal favourite anime! WATCH IT NOW!",3
fairy-tail,"Alright... So.. This series has been in my top 10 for like forever. The characters, the animation, the manga. Everything about it, is perfect. The animation from Series 1 gradually became what this is going to be starting out as. The movie for Fairy Tail, had the same animation style of this.  If you like a ground Shounen/Action anime, Fairy Tail is amazing. Lost of amazing characters, and fight scenes. Everything about this series (Cannon wise) is perfect. (Not the fillers. Meh.)",3
fairy-tail,"Fairy Tail is a great fighting series.  With it's explosive battles (from the very start) and   electrifying music,this show will definitely get you fired up! There is also a wide cast of characters each with their own developed backstories. This show has great action and a well developed magic world, so why only 3 stars? It is  very predictable. No matter who they're up against, be it demons or guild masters, the main characters will  always win! This is especially true of Natsu. The battles usually follow a pattern of the villain showing how unbelievably powerful he is, beating our heroes to a pulp, then said heroes thinking about their friends or guild  and promptly one-shotting the villain in an unexplained surge of power and stamina. It gets to the point where you root for the villains because you know they're up against people who literally cannot lose.  I suppose what I'm trying to say is that Fairy Tail is quite asinine and requires one to have a pretty naive view on strength human durability. There is a scene where a normal man walks through  lava  to help two girls and literally comes away with a few scratches, 'cause willpower yo. -_-",5
fairy-tail,"Ok, let me start off this review by saying that I personally enjoy Fairy Tail. That doesn't mean I won't be honest and talk about it's bad parts though.STORY:Story is pretty lack luster, I won't lie. The setting is cool, and it has a lot of unique characters, but the plot line in general is not unique, and it is pretty predictable. CHARACTERS:The main character is pretty cookie cutter among anime (his attitude of always wanting to get stronger to protect his friends). Lucy is kind of annoying at times. Reminds me of Orihime from Bleach. The other characters aren't as bad as those  two. Erza is bad-*** and has a strong personality. Happy is there for comedic relief, and he does a pretty good job at it. The bad guys are all pretty lame. They are made out to be very powerful, but of course, they are always beaten by Natsu or his allies. No one ever dies, and they do the annoying ""flashback in a fight so I can power up and beat you"" thing a lot... A LOT. Also, they like to recruit beaten villains and make them into good guys. This is actually pretty cool, and I don't really mind it, because some of the villains are cooler than the actual heroes.FIGHTS:Fight scenes are generally good. Well animated, but can be drawn out. Also, there is never really any tension in fight scenes, because you can ALWAYS count on the good guys to win. As I stated before, no one is ever in any real danger because no one dies.FAN SERVICE:This is pretty much the biggest reason most people watch Fairy Tail. They do have a lot of fan service, and they do it pretty well. For instance, Lucy is always showing cleavage, and they have multiple episodes where the women of Fairy Tail are in bikinis. Gray being shirtless all the time is fan service for the lady viewers, and they like to show of Natsu's abs a lot too.FINAL SCORE:All in all, Fairy Tail isn't a bad show. It has some annoying qualities, but you should try to ignore them. Don't take it seriously, it isn't meant to be taken seriously. Just watch it for fun.",5
fairy-tail,"I am writing from a perspective of someone who has watched a lot of anime and I mean it, so please do trust me here: this is not in any way, shape or form, worth your time. I have watched all of the episodes from the beginning and I can clearly and objectively explain that this isn't it. The only way this show is still afloat is due to those who have only watched one anime in their life, refusing to believe that this is trash and see it for what it is actually worth. So far there have been numerous lazy plotholes which the writers have solved by TIME-TRAVELLING, and its always the same thing. You can have one fight lasting as long as 10 episodes, with useless, plain and emotionless history, inevitably leading any heartfelt moments to a waste. Furthermore, the animations are indescribably weak compared to any modern seasonal anime, I'll even go as far as saying that they are weak compared to old animes; such as the same old Naruto or even Bleach.  Simply put: there isn't anything this show has to offer. It has a weak story, emotionless character development, plot-holes, dragged out/irrelevant situations, repetition of careless escapes from writers mistakes and horrid animation. Also the most generic and uninteresting characters which interact in the most boring way possible.As you can see, I'm genuinely sad to have wasted so much time on this in hopes of the writers pulling themselves together.~peace",3
fairy-tail,"Fairy Tail can be an exhausting tromp, but a fun one. I slogged through everything from the beginning, and for the most part I enjoyed everything right up through Fairy Tail Zero. Yeah, there's a lot of filler episodes where people grit their teeth and grunt a bunch and have flashbacks to the previous episode, so much so that there ends up being only around 10 minutes of actual new episode. That's just a fact of the series, you're gonna hit those. But then they'll actually have some content for a few episodes in a row and it's great fun.I was excited for Final Season. Then I started watching it. Everything about it is ... off. Wrong somehow. The art looks cheaper than it ever has before, the voices all sound different. The behavior of the characters is more like a fanfic, doing things that don't make sense, making out-of-character decisions.If you liked Fairy Tail, I'd advise stopping at Zero. Just walk away with some good memories and call it done.",4.5
fairy-tail,"This show is repetitive. Hilariously repetitive. Cliches are beaten to death, fanservice is rampant, and the overall plot is so predictable that it almost destroys the point in watching the show at all. There are no new major developments, no plot twists, and no prevalent changes in characters. At the end of each arc pretty much all the characters are in the same state as they were in before the arc even began, and in fact, many characters haven't changed at all since the very beginning of the anime itself.No one can deny this.That being said, why then do so many people enjoy it? Why does this have a 4.5 rating? Well, it is simply because the blatant repetitiveness is exactly what they like about this show. They know that every week they can turn to this show for their dose of busty fanservice and cheesy banter and never be disappointed. In other words, it appeals to kids. It also gives a sense that the show will never end. With the characters always staying the same, it means that the story can go anywhere, and anything can happen. But if the plot develops too much, and the show starts to mature, then the story is put on a linear order of events eventually leading to the show's permanent end.So basically, this anime serves as a invariable base for weekly viewing. It's not going anywhere soon, nor will it for a long time. That comfort alone is why so many people love this anime, but for casual viewers like me, it just doesn't cut it. This is by no means the ""best anime ever"", and I implore older audiences to bypass this one and enjoy the more invigorating series that crunchyroll has to offer. Frankly put, this show is the anime equivalent of Spongebob.",4.5
fairy-tail,"Mediocre is definitely the best way to describe Fairy Tail; but I wouldn't say that I would rate it mediocre the entire way through. When I started watching this anime I was quite drawn into it - but as the anime went along and got towards the end it has become an increasingly big chore to continue watching it. Primarily I think the anime has a problem with status quo and that it gets returned too far too often to it. The main characters very much have that feeling of being trapped in amber - which is quite an odd thing to say because 'every' other character seems to show growth and change. In some way or another, things always return to the Guild Hall. Generally in battles the main characters start off being beaten down before licking their wounds and getting back up to continue.I found myself wanting more from the main characters, and more to happen to them. It would have been nice to see Gray pull a Sasuke and go evil or Erza take over leadership of the guild - which is hinted at in the final episode but not really established. Maybe have Lucy pull a Dark Phoenix - in terms of personality and power changing.... But, status quo....Then there are other issues: Too much emphasis was given on 'child/parent' episodes, to the point that every main character had their parents interact with them - and I mean literally every one. The 'Power Levels' of the different characters in the series seem to not matter; where stronger characters seem to be beaten by weaker characters, despite them being weaker. An extreme lack of 'dying' happens in this anime - even in the last season where you would expect the series characters to die left and right; only some of the villains seem to die.Overall I can only recommend watching this anime if you want a long anime to watch. I wouldn't consider it a must watch or anything and if you do watch it, or if you do watch it, consider whether it is worth continuing to watch it if you find yourself losing interest (trust me, it doesn't get better, it is just more of the same).",3
fairy-tail,"now, hold on before you hold up your pitchforks.  i say that this is a mediocre anime. i will say that the visuals are really nice to look at, and the soundtrack is by far the greatest thing about this anime. to say that the soundtrack is good, is honestly an understatement. however, what i do have an issue with when it comes to this anime is the repetitive plot. like i have said before, the visuals and soundtrack are very good but this anime has a shallow plot. at first, this anime is pretty hyped up and i liked it at the start even though it was little too fan-service crazy(nowhere near the level it is now though), but after that it really started to go downhill? i mean yeah you felt pretty hyped up during the fights because of the soundtrack, but most of the fights in this show go along the lines of..""oh no, the [insert villain] is too strong, and i can't beat them. i'm sorry, but i can't do this! but wait, i just need to remember my friends, fairy tail, and what i'm fighting for! [insert power up, completely obliterates the enemy]"" something like that can be okay the first time around, but to repeat that process over and over again can get a bit irritating. i sometimes find myself cheering on for the enemy, to see if they'll be able to win against our protagonists. now, the next issue i have is the fan-service. now it's okay to have a little bit of fan-service in any show like this, but the amount in this show is god awful. there is WAY too much of it, to the point where it actually could probably sideline the plot. in fact, it has a couple times. so, if you don't like fan-service, i would recommend straying away from this show. and the next issue i have with the anime is the fact that a lot of characters are sidelined. in the show, later on, there's only about a handful of protagonists that actually matter in the show, while the rest are too weak to keep up. even lucy, whom i thought would be the main protagonist alongside natsu, is sidelined a lot and is underestimated. overall, this anime is mediocre and if you're looking for visuals and soundtrack in an anime, you should watch this for sure. but if you're looking for super detailed plot, i would look for a different show. i suppose i am being a little soft since this is one of the first shows that ever made me almost cry, but now that's all kind of hidden behind the amount of fan-service, sidelining, and awful power differences between characters. i'd recommend stopping at fairytail zero.",4
fairy-tail,"I've always considered the story of FairyTail very.. ""childish""If you are into anime for the visuals and music, then fairytail won't disappoint you. However, this anime is not for you if you care about the story. FairyTail story lacks depth. There are rarely any elements of mystery in the sory. The leveling up of characters doesn't make sense and the reasons why one character would win a fight has no sound logic except that,, well he's the good guy. Very cliche lines of ""friendship"" and so on..",1
fairy-tail,"I have watched a lot of anime, probably dozens of series.  My favorite is Rurouni Kenshin, for its gravitas, depth, themes, tension, drama, and music.  Fairy Tail may not have the same level of gravitas, but it provides characters you grow to love, has emotional moments that can hit you in the gut (and with music to match), a reasonably rich lore with world-building, and a offers a spirit of hope despite the odds.  Can some enemies be defeated by repetitive ""friendship power""?  Yes, and this is a negative.  But I am giving my rating by how the show overall made me feel.  It's quite a ride, and now that it is finished, I am dearly going to miss it.  It has easily solidified itself in my personal ""Top 5"" list of anime I have watched until now.",2
fairy-tail,"I love fairy tail. Been into since the very beginning and I'm sad that it's about to end, but all good things must come to an end.All the characters are amazing and I love the art designs of all of them as well. This show has constantly made me laugh, and I've grown very attached to the characters as a whole.  The music is one of my favorite parts of this anime too.I look forward to the glorious ending of fairy tail.",2
fairy-tail,"This show is what got me into anime in the first place. The shonen genre is vast and is made up of a multitude of shows, but Fairy Tail is one of the shows that goes above and beyond others. This show is all about overcoming obstacles together and how breaking barriers is possible. Fairy Tail is a show that deserves to be watched and re-watched multiple times. Don't let other reviews hold you back from this show. Try the first episode itself, and you'll find yourself hooked.",2
fairy-tail,"Can't articulate how much I love Fairy Tail. My favorite cosplay comes from Fairy Tail. We even have a guild with 20+ people from the show. The bonding between characters; the lasting desire of love for friends and family. Naruto may be my childhood and favorite anime, but Fairy Tail is nearly on par with it. The fillers don't ever feel like fillers either. If I ever need a pick-me up, Fairy Tail is also a perfect choice even if I have watched the episode(s) numerous times. Let's not forget the OVA's like the water park and Fairy Tail Christmas! The final season is doing extremely well and following the manga relatively close. I'm All Fired Up Reviewing This!",3
fairy-tail,"Fairy Tail has a rather...unique place in my heart. It was the first anime to bring me close to tears, and yet I find myself cringing at it far too often. This anime is a golden experience buried under a pile of trash. I'm fine with the occasional asspull in anime, but Fairy Tail goes kinda overboard. Crappy power-scaling issues plague this show's later seasons, along with the unnecessary over-sexualization of many of its characters (mostly the females). This anime doesn't need a bunch of half naked ladies to make it a good show. If you strip away most of the erotic fanservice, make the dialogue flow better, and give the characters more motives to fight other than ""friends, then you've got an absolute masterpiece of a show before you.",5
fairy-tail,"A friend told me about Fairy Tail, so I decided to check it out. I bought the first three books to the manga and hopped initially onto netflix to watch the first episodes. I came over here when I finished those to finish watching the series. I have been unable to stop binging Fairy Tail, it's my new favorite anime. I haven't been this attached to a series in forever. All of the characters are different, special - the bad guys are in depth and detailed. I love the level of emotion this anime has. It's just great.",3
fairy-tail,"Out of every anime adaptation to a long running shonen that is currently airing, I think Fairy Tail is consistently of the highest quality it can be with its awesome soundtrack and great voice acting. This series has it all, awesome battles between manly characters, lots of fanservice from some of the sexiest grills in anime/manga and the material is adapted at a good rate with covering more than one chapter per episode and the times they do only cover one chapter its a chapter that deserves more screentime. I will throw my money at this franchise til the end of time. Also its pretty generic but if you like shonen than its no problem.",4.5
fairy-tail,"At First i didnt like it i didnt even bother to watch the show because of the name, Then i saw the manga at library i read i was like wow this is awesome, Then i watched the show i got hooked this is one of my favorite anime. It has everything you could look for in an anime, Comedy, Romance, Epic Fights, The feels Y_Y, and what i think i like the most is that it connects with ppl well im my opinion and the best quote i like is ""You don't die for your friends you live for them""",4.5
fairy-tail,"Original Series was a 4/5 for me. Useless fillers and bad animation.BUT THIS is movie quality Fairy Tail. It has a lot of manga content ahead of it so there should be no filler arcs. Ive rewatched the entire past series for this day, and boy am I excited. Fairy Tail IS the best Shonen anime ever. Its a feeling I cannot describe. Through frustrations and sadness, this show will continue to be my favourite no matter how bad an episode gets. Many people experienced this. The story wont blow you away but theres just magic in the air that draws you back every week. It kind of sad that fairy tail is back again since I will have to experience the unimaginable pain of waiting and entire week for a new episode. Fairy Tail may be the death of meBTW. Even if you hate fairy tail, watch it for the animation. Smoother than silk (As seen from the trailers)",3
fairy-tail,"Which was: let us copy some traits from best at that time - Naruto, One Piece, Bleach - and merge them into one. After some time (one or two arcs) strong foundations were washed out (along with character development and any emotional investment) and all that left is fanservice. Lot of fanservice. And considering how usually female and male staff wears clothing or what kind of situational gags they are performing, this tells a lot about how it sustained that long on the market, and what audience expect from this thrilling experience which is watching Fairy Tail and being charitable enough to compare it to classics like DB, HxH or mentioned above Big Three.Thing that irritated me, after some episodes, and whole manga (including 100 years quest) is that actually every next arc is copy-my-homework-but-change-it-slightly of the previous ones. We have bunch of bad guys, at the beginning they are crushing our good guys, and them magically (no pun intended), with the POWER OF FRIENDSHIP, someone (preferrably Natsu) defeats worst guy in the pack with the power of straight right punch. Rest of the villains from the bunch is taken out in prolonged, grotesque fights that are trying to pretend to the very end that winner of given skirmish was not decided from the start.This show takes these and other most generic features, that in normal, healthy shonen can become irritating (repetitive and boring) in the longer run, and intensifies them. Exponentially. If the title of this show would be ""Gintama"", i would consider this as satirical take on the whole genre. Actually Fairy Tail tries very hard to be considered ""not serious"" but in the end it looks as excuse to reuse all cliches and tropes for minimal effort put into developing or changing something.Villains are repetitive, luckily they are mildly redesigned from the outside. In case that would not help distinguish them, some tatoos are added, or hairstyles are recoloured. Between arcs major change is location. Everything else is copied straight from the rich expertise of previous arcs as well as plenty is ""borrowed"" from strongest players on the field, to which FT pretends to belong. Some characters like Leo are simply redrawn (Kurosaki Ichigo rings a bell?).There are some scenes, which want to be emotional, like laxus coming to town, some backstories are even served for some members of Fairy tail in attempt to give them a purpose other than being display for undersized and too tight and too revealing clothing, but in the end all of this turn out pretentious and bland.There is actually no character developement at all (growing hair, changing clothes and punching harder is not character developement).  So worst character traits will remain with them until the end. For example forced and unfunny ""rivalries"" that Natsu has with others, Elfman yelling something about manliness, Cana being notoriously drunk. Yes, in cases of the majority of the characters, those will be only traits, that would make them recognizable in this whole jolly bunch. Goku changed more throughout all of DB series and he has FLAT character arc. Gags are not funny and forced, there is minimal or no added value taken out from arc after it closes. So You can watch them selectively with no fear of missing something important.As i mentioned at the beginning. The show could be descendant of Big Three, but in terms of overall quality, the closest it gets to them is: Make ramen with rasengan filler from Naruto, Rebellion of Zanpakuto filler from Bleach, Fishmen kingdom from One Piece.",5
fairy-tail,"Everything here is before the final (BS IMO) Season...Animation: 8(Action scenes are good natsu's fire and grey's Ice powers looks the best but overall everything is animated and colorful unlike many parts in Final Season)Story: Good (Really good for each arc The Storys Feel like they could happen in the fairy tail universe though its a lil unrealistic That FairyTail saves the day so much in some arcs that they collaborate with other guilds besides being basic support and not having a major key part. On that note The Final Season makes the least amount of sense as far as arcs in FT. It doesn't seem Zeref has the ability to care about something and make a wave of death appear when its Obvious he cares about natsu WHERE WAS THAT WAVE)Plots and Twists: Novice (Theirs many points in the anime that the creators themselves forget abilities, tricks, and even basic persona can alter how fights go down. Some examples favors the enemies some examples favor the protag the best example arc of this is the season before the FairyTail Zero episodes Curse vs magic)Development: Rarely used/Nonexistent (We watch anime for good animation good story Good well placed twists and plots in which the main characters have to learn new ways to get over obstacles. Here that is technically non-existent Its mostly ""We knew how to do that"" not ""Hey I can absorb other types of magic and use them in combination to mine"" <this makes sense for Natsu... He absorbs Laxus's lightning and only used it after the Tenroe arc for the grand magic games ever since he forgot? The fairytail guild also learned that Grey and Juvia can perform a UNISON RAID WHICH IS NOT EXPANDED UPON So that's for development. Well socially the relationships between guild mates fairs way better than Wizard skills on this show. Also Wizard Saints are more like wizard jokes they are supposed to be top tier wizards 5 of them were defeated on the final season guess they didn't develop too huh?)All and all I will say this anime is for watching for fun and not to take seriously clearly it doesn't take it self seriously... I mean if they knew before hand Zeref and his friends were gonna attack maybe just maybe the dragon slayers coulda honed their skills and natsu could have been a Dark fire(with rogues shadow powers in which rogue is boring with) breathing blinding light on contact badass that can still melt anything around him like he did in those two episodes after Zero... but then again he lost that ability too... 3 stars hopefully the game is better :)Best season: Edolas Arc: The vast changes in each main characters based on a separate universe and their culture and way of life was refreshing to say the leastWorst season Tartaros arc: This season all main characters had Naruto style plot armor to the MAX Wendy cutting her hair and becoming OP also not in final season she grew her hair back Development guys she grew her hair back and became weak again...Bye development! Sorry Sakura still just a healer with no spotlight Oops i meant Mercy(with the potg moment never the potg) oops I meant Wendy...",5
fairy-tail,"Show starts out decent, but it's easy to see how the author, whatever his name is, ran out of ideas. Then, the show takes what could be a single episode and drags it out into 7. Everything is predictable, there is no sense of anticipation, and never any fear of losing a character, due to the ridiculous amount of plot armor. Characters have no depth: They have a single attribute that is overused, and little else. The animation takes a serious nosedive the further along the show goes, to the point where it looks like you're watching a Powerpoint slideshow. I only watched the entire series because I'm completionist, and it was not worth the hours of my life wasted. If it wasn't for the fan service (the only thing that made sticking around so long slightly bearable), this would be considered a children's show. The story is written for people with the intellect of 8-year-olds, but it's filled with boobs and booty, so I'm not sure who this is intended for. Don't waste your time watching this show. The beginning is alright, but that doesn't make the rest of the series worth investing into.",4
fairy-tail,"Wie alle langläufigen Titel hat auch Fairy Tail mit seinen 328 Episoden keine Perfekte Story, keinen durchweg perfekten Spannungsbogen und definitiv seine Durchhänger und Schwächen. Gerade die mangelde Konsequenz bei dramatischen Momenten schadet meiner Meinung nach der Story und ""zerstört"" jedwede Spannung. So kann man sich sicher sein das selbst in den düsteren Storyabschnitten niemand stirbt und alles ein Happy Ending hat. Aber warum gebe ich dann Trozdem 5 Sterne?Ganz einfach ich liebe Magie und Arbenteuer! Und genau das bietet Fairy Tail in kombination mit einem coolen Cast.

From there the series took me on a journey that was an absolute blast from beginning to end, filled with laughter, happiness, and tears.  I loved the story, lore and fantasy setting. The characters are so lovable and memorable.  The fights are exciting and fast paced.  The music is legendary.  I don't think i had just a fantastic experience watching an anime before.  I will continue to re-watch and support this series for years to come.Long Live Fairy Tail.",5
fairy-tail,"Fairy Tail is in the league of Dragon Ball, Naruto, Bleach, One Piece and Detective Conan as one of the ""mega-anime"". Spanning hundreds of episodes and many story arcs it gives viewers an evolving show that gradually introduces a colorful and mostly kid friendly cast of characters with a wide variety of abilities. Because the show takes place in a world of magic with very few self imposed rules, almost anything goes and this works both in the show's favor and against it. The wide variety of abilities and skills makes most action scenes very interesting. However the lack of consistency makes it difficult to really understand how strong characters are in relation to one another.Despite Natsu appearing to be the main character on most official title pages, the real main character is Lucy. Much of the series is told from her perspective and speaks to one of the strongest parts of the show: awesome female characters. Lucy, Erza and Wendy and a lot of strong supporting characters make Fairy Tail stand out from its rivals. Furthermore the close bonds of friendship the series emphasizes is comparable to One Piece too. Every main character and most of the supporting cast from their guild remains relevant to the story right up until the end. Very much in stark contrast to other similar series where the MC often becomes the only character who can stand up to the antagonists. The sheer length of the show allowed for a wide variety of antagonists as well. From stereotypical evil baddies, to self righteous types doing the wrong things for perhaps the right reasons, to enemies who were simply insane the show has some of each and almost everything in between. Even a few purely as comedic relief. On the other hand the length of the show is also something of a hindrance. It's so massive that committing to watching the show will be a tall order for most viewers. Furthermore the quality of the story and animation varies inconsistently. At times it has rivaled some of the best anime ever and at other times felt like budget series. It was not a start weak and get strong factor either, but an up and down of quality.Another potential drawback is, although the women of the series are very strong, they are often quite sexualized. It's no doubt some viewers will enjoy that, others will also be bothered by it. The men are much the same, ripped idealized bodies of muscle. The music has a wide range as well. Some truly outstanding songs at times and at other times cookie cutter ""anime music"" that you've heard a dozen other times.In the end however, the show is far more enjoyable than not. Fun action, colorful and interesting characters, strong women, lots of eye candy, and a simple and effective story set in a wonderfully fantastical world that screams of imagination and adventure. This show hands down wins the war of mega-anime for me personally and would get my highest recommendation for anime of its type. Pros:Great cast of charactersWonderful settingStrong women on par with or stronger than menCharacters who remain on par with each other, as opposed to one over-powered MCCons:Every man is ripped and muscled, every women is a bombshell and everyone is sexualized to some extent. Long series is a daunting time commitmentInconsistent production quality, at times superb, at times mediocre",5
fairy-tail,"Say what you want about predictability and it being repetitive, this series was nothing short of an explosive adventure.

I always enjoyed fairy tail despite the amount of hate the anime has, I genuinely think some people fail to understand what good anime is maybe it's just a matter of taste when it comes to anime but fairy tail is funny, you'll come across some scenes that will get you laughing so much so that you will have to pause the show until you calm down a little. FYI, i just described myself watching this anime.  I started on fairy tail long time ago, i been impatiently waiting for the final season and here it is, it's a very action based anime when it comes to fight scenes, it will give you the goosebumps of cool natsu can be. (that's if you're into OP characters) .  that's all i gotta say, i highly recommend it, now that final season is currently under production and new episode released every week, if you folks start now. you can watch extra 10 episodes of the final season cause it's going to take you a long time to catch up.",4.5
fairy-tail,"My friend recommended this to me a year ago. At that time, I've stopped watching anime for 5 years. My best friend happens to be an otaku XD So I started watching this to find that I've watched this before, so I rewatched it. Sure, there are parts were it's hard to watch, but it's all worth it. Nostalgia hits me hard when I think back to the beginning of this anime. FT isn't an anime where they play with your emotions, you always get that determined feeling when someone defeats a character. Sorry, I'm all over the place, but this anime is addicting.",5
fairy-tail,"Fairy Tail has it all! The fights, The adventure, The many different character designs and plots, but It draws out the Fantasy aspect too much in my opinion. The heroes always win and Nobody ever dies. While the villain is always left in defeat and Never has a victory. If you've seen the Lord of the Rings movie then you will understand what I mean. Aside from the Fantasy plot, everything else is perfect! I rate this anime a 4 out of 5 *s",5
fairy-tail,"(Remember, this is MY opinion, and you do not have to agree. Also, SPOILER ALERT! Read at your own risk.)I think that Fairy Tail was a fairly well executed anime, and I would give it 4 stars. I mean, I am OBSESSED with the manga, the anime, and the soundtracks. I absolutely LOVE it. But, even with my love for the series, I am aware that there could be some improvements, which is why I gave it 4 stars, not 5. First, I think the characters are just great. The backstories of each character gives them a bit more ""character"", I guess. Without their past stories, they wouldn't really have a goal which they are wishing to achieve in the future. For example, Natsu Dragneel was raised by a dragon named Igneel, but suddenly disappeared. From then on, he kept on looking for Igneel, which you could call his goal. Gray Fullbuster, his village was attacked by Deliora, the demon of disaster. Of course, he seeks for revenge, and as he discovers more about this demon, he crosses paths with his father (or what was left of him). All the other characters have their history, and we slowly find out more about them throughout the series. Isn't that exciting? But there is one thing which I find somewhat ""annoying"" about these characters. Fan service. You know what I mean... but after watching more than 200 episodes of it, I guess it just seems ""normal"" after some time, and doesn't bother me as much. But what really drives me nuts is Lucy's so-called s-e-x appeal. Sure she's pretty and all, but she doesn't have to show it off. Erza (and a lot of other characters) somewhat do it too, but not as much as Lucy. With that aside, Lucy is still a good character, and without her, the story would be very, very... weird. Another thing which I really like about the series are the plot twists. Come on, some evil guy from 7 years in the future visits the past to rule the world with dragons, Natsu's brother (or should I say, creator) is the most evil villain in the series, I think they make the story much more interesting. Now, more of the things for improvement. I'll just say it straight up, too much nakama power. I understand, friends are important and all, but it doesn't have to be the only reason for the wizards to fight. It can be used, but not on every single arc. But, after watching a gazillion of these arcs, I got used to it, and I guess I just have to accept that friends are why everyone moves on. But to argue with my own argument, a lot of people find this nakama power annoying, but who else are these wizards supposed to fight for? They don't have family. All their friends are family. So they fight for them. There's nothing wrong with that. But I will say it again, it's been used so many times. Next, I think that the arcs are interesting in their own way. It does get all over the place at times, but that's what makes it interesting! Traveling to another dimension, meeting your counterpart, and all those great things. Animation is great, and now with technology evolving, it can get even better. I am looking forward to that, especially on the new episodes. It's going to be epic. Themes, openings, endings, awesome. That main theme puts the watchers in the mood. The openings are just... GREAT! I just love them, also the endings. That's all I have to say. I have a lot more great things to say about this series, but of course, its not perfect. Overall, I love the series, and I am looking forward to the new episodes.",5
fairy-tail,"I came into it with a bias opinion of what I thought the anime would be, because of the controversy around it.. like Hiro Mashima not having the ending written down or the characters never dying, but I was pleasantly surprised. After the first ten to twenty episodes I really started to warm up to the characters and liked where the story was heading, its pretty much a basic shonen but really entertaining and has nice elements to it.",5
fairy-tail,"I looked at the picture three years ago, and i was hooked. Let me tell you, love at first sight is real.First of all, the character development is the best in any series I've ever seen since Sword Art Online. Character development can refer to either the task of sitting down and creating a character (working out their appearance, history, mannerisms, and so on), or it can refer to the change a character undergoes during the course of a story. And, let me tell you, this show did that good.And let me tell you, this show is AMAZING!!! I can't even describe how amazing it is! Let me take you back to when I watched episode one.I was sitting in my bed cutting my pizza with scissors and I saw the poster I told you about and just WOW. I watched the first episode, then the second, then the third, and, before I knew it I had watched 30 episodes and skipped school. It didn't matter because I was failing anyways LOL XD. I really believe this show changed my life. I was more like Natsu then I was myself. Three years ago, I thought I looked like garbage, but now I don't care what I look like. I'm a Nol and I love Fairy Tail ;P!",4
fairy-tail,"I must say I love Fairy Tail. It’s my favorite anime, and that’s saying a lot, considering I love anime and have watched quite a few. In this review I will talk about the pros and cons of Fairy Tail, in my opinion. Please don’t feel angry, for this is only my opinion. Everyone has different opinions, after all. Let’s start with the pros! First off, the plot is really great and I can tell Hiro Mashima put a lot of work into the design of the anime and manga. He’s also a great artist- he drew the manga all by himself!!! There is not just one plot that all the arcs revolve around. Every arc has its own story, which is great because it never gets boring. I especially love the Grand Magic Games and the Tartaros Arc. The Key of Starry Heavens, I must admit, could have been better. The Eclipse Arc was cool too. The Galuna Arc was also a good way to appeal to me and keep me on the edge of my seat, motivating me to finish the whole arc and move on to watch the entire rest of the anime. The second pro is that everyone has their own personality. It’s not just everybody is OP (lookin’ at you, Naruto!) or everyone is super weak or something. Some people are powerful, like Natsu, Gray, Erza, Laxus, Gildarts, Kagura, Zeref, Mavis, the Ten Wizard Saints, The Spriggan 12, and many other wizards. Some are on the weak side, like Levy, Milliana, Lucy, Toby, Chelia, and various other Mages. And as for personality, Natsu’s energetic and clueless at times, Gray’s cool and serious at times, Erza is stern and sometimes girly, Lucy is caring and sometimes vain, Wendy is compassionate and sometimes insecure, etc., you get the idea. Another pro is that, though the outcome is always the good guys win, the process of fights are all different. Sometimes it’s sadder, sometimes secrets are revealed, sometimes it’s an easy fight, and sometimes it’s a drawn-out, long and difficult fight. Yet another pro is that the music and layout of the anime is fantastic. The music is awesome, especially the Fairy Tail theme song, in my opinion. The characters are also very well-drawn. Obviously Hiro Mashima and whoever else helped him draw them as well as background objects really know how to correctly proportion everything! Props to Hiro Mashima and his cast and crew for all their hard work that really paid off!!!Time for the cons, now. There are only two, in my opinion, both related. The most egregious issue, I think, is the fan service. Fairy Tail really overused it. Now, I know you’re mainly thinking about fan service directed to all those perverted boys out there, but I also mean fan service for those fangirls. All the guys are crazy TONED. I’m a girl, but I’m a tomboy and have no interest whatsoever in 6- or 8- pack abs or tanned guys, so this really bothers me. Mashima really wants girls to get the idea that those Mages are really muscular, for some reason- all the guys walk around without shirts a lot. I watched the whole anime one time through without even noticing, as I didn’t care about that, but I read some reviews about Fairy Tail, some of them regarding fan service, and a few mentioning the muscle-bound guys. Then I rewatched Fairy Tail later on and couldn’t help but notice that it really was irritating. But the bigger issue (the second issue with Fairy Tail), I believe, even more than the abs of guys in Fairy Tail, is the fan service directed to boys. And that really is a huge issue. Obviously the pros overpower the cons, but I am very annoyed with the overuse of booby and panty shots. I’m glad that at least little girls like Wendy and Meredy before the 7-year gap don’t have boobs though. That makes it more realistic, but still, the girls’ boobs are so big, each one is the size of the girl’s face! And the filler episodes, where the guild goes to the beach to train or whatever, make the problem worse. The girls are all wearing skimpy, revealing bikinis, even Wendy, who has nothing to reveal. Apparently all girls just have to wear a bikini! I, for one, have never touched a bikini. I wear a swim shirt and swim trunks to swim. Anyways, that’s not the point. The point is the fan service. All the guys are perverts, too, especially all the old dudes like Makarov and Gildarts and Macao and Wakaba. So when they see a girl, like, loose her bikini top or something, they all turn bright red. In the OVA, even Elfman gets perverted at the sight of his SISTER- yes, his SISTER, as in Mirajane- without her bikini top at Ryuzetsu Land. Which brings me to the OVA- that’s the worst. If I were to give the OVA a rating, it’d be 2/5 stars. Three stars down just for the excessive amount of fan service, that’s how much I hate fan service. In the OVA, especially “Fun in Ryuzetsu Land!” or something like that, there is so much fan service. So much! First off, Erza loses not only her “legendary” bikini bottom, but also her bikini top! While on the Love Love Slider with a guy- Jellal, the dude she’s shipped with! I mean, come on! She gets naked while a red-as-a-lobster guy is next to her. How coincidental (I’m being sarcastic, in case you couldn’t tell. I’m sure you could). Second of all, Jenny pulls Mirajane’s bikini top off and Mirajane gets her back by pulling down Jenny’s bikini bottom. Is that not fan service? Also, there is, like, an episode with Lucy naked and bathing or showering every twenty episodes or something, which is annoying. In the “Natsu v.s. Mavis” OVA or something, they show all the girls fully naked and bathing all together. You get the point? I am fed up with the fan service. But wait!!! You should totally watch Fairy Tail!!! Just because I talked about its downsides for too long, doesn’t mean it’s bad! Fairy Tail is the best! That’s why I gave it five stars!!! I totally recommend this anime AND manga!!! Have fun watching and reading it! You’ll love it, if you want a long, super-awesome anime with too much fan service. Even if you don’t like long, super-awesome animes with too much fan service, watch it! Even though I hate fan service, I love the anime! It’s the BEST. Have fun!",5
fairy-tail,"Fairytail was one of the first animes I got into and had the chance to binge watch all of the seasons. At first I was obsessed only to realize after watching Naruto Shippuden, Cowboy Bebop, Fate/Zero that Fairytail was just mediocre. I was going to give this four stars ( just because there was a decent amount of good content) but after seeing the Dragon Cry Movie I confirmed my opinion at 3 stars. The focus has shifted even MORE on sexual parts of the characters and less on their focus or stories. I was really dissapointed with the movie and OVAs.",5
fairy-tail,"School teaches me math, english, chemistry and etc. It's a building designed to train the knowledge part of my brain.Why am I talking about school?Fairy Tail taught me things I would never learn in a school. It's enjoyable and my all time fave anime, Naruto or Natsu? Well, I have no clue because I love them both.Each character has their own unique personality which is great!This anime has triggered every emotion possible inside of me. To be honest I believe it's a roller coaster of emotions!In the end, I love this anime with all my heart. After I heard that it's ending my heart shattered into thousands of tiny little pieces.I will sure miss this anime, for those who haven't watched it yet, I HIGHLY RECCOMEND IT!",5
fairy-tail,I started watching Fairy Tail season two and then got caught up with both the anime and manga (manga being after.. ) in only like 3 or 4 months. Now That the anime is over with I feel sad because It was my favorite anime to watch every weekend.. Tartaros arc is by far one of the best Arcs in Fairy Tail ever (imo..)   and the Grand magic games starts off a bit slow but at the start of season two is where things get pretty interesting. If you like anime like DBZ or Maybe anime that have a lot to do with magic and RPG like stuff.  then this might be something you can get into.. Fairy tail isn't made to be taken too seriously.,5
fairy-tail,"FT was the first anime I could really get into, it's a great gateway to a wonderful world full of original and lovable characters. The more you watch FT, the more you feel like you're part of their family.I think the character development and story lines are amazing and inspiring. Watching the characters learn and better themselves makes  you want to keep watching them.-Also, shipping in this anime is riiculous . It's pretty obvious who will end up together so it isn't as heartbreaking.",4.5
fairy-tail,"Those that are done raging between anime/manga adaptions feel free to read. Those who still don't understand why books and movies will ever be the same feel free to go away. With that being said, Fairy Tail is easily the best Shounen anime to date! Take this from a non-hardcore shounen fan. Granted, i do enjoy shounen as a casual viewer (despite me seeing over 3000 shounen eps) but I stand by my statement 100%",4.5
fairy-tail,"Ever since I have watched the first season on Netflix back 2 years ago, I was immediately hooked on how hilarious and amazing this anime is. It has made me laugh at so many times that most of them I cried. After all the intense drama that there is in the anime, it just comes back around like a hula hoop. Hilarious, awesome, sad, and heartwarming.Plus, it has some very cute characters that are amazingly delicate in their own way. Definitely recommend it, Truly a masterpiece!",5
fairy-tail,"Pleas fanboys & fangirls spare me...Humor in fantasy adventure anime usually makes my eyes roll but the wise cracks in the show actually makes me laugh. Every character is likable, even the bad guys. The romance is good but can be annoying when your OTP win't just shut up and kiss already...Talking to you Happy and Jellal! Just kidding, I don't actually ship them. The flashbacks are great and have a great score to go along with it. Pyromancy has always been a soft spot for me so Natsu is an ultimate plus. The anime itself is very repetitive but to not jump right into hypocrisy I'll just tell you to read the other low reviews.",1
fairy-tail,"While this show can make you sit on the edge of your seat and make you wonder what goes on next, it also provides you with light moments of comedy. And that's not just it,but when you watch this show you build  bond with the characters and understand how they feel throughout the show. And while your building your bond feel their emotions aswell and cry with them. Fairy Tail teaches me about life and that it's special and shouldn't be taken for granted.If you're searching for a show that will give you laughter,love, joy, sadness, and excitement, watch Fairy Tail and hop on the adventure with everyone!Side note:If you're a guy enjoy the fanservice that goes along with it ;).",3
fairy-tail,"This is one of my favorite series. It shows a great story line and has characters like no other. This is an anime that sets itself apart from the typical fantasy anime, it makes you actually like the characters. So if someone were to die, you would feel something, and not just be like: ""Oh, cool...well then..."" All in all, I would recommend this to anyone. It is funny and can get a bit ""fanservice-y(?) at times.",2
fairy-tail,"At the start this show was  AMAZING but... after the first 2 arcs it just felt all filler, because I preferred the simple easy side missions they went on while they waited for the next bit, but after a little they forgot to do that and just went after big missions, the world use to feel dynamic, but then it just got boring basically, If you want a good story where you can learn to love the characters personally, you're not wanting to be here This anime is good, but repetitive, not good for ADHD/Dyslexic people, you'll get more attached to the backround then you do the main characters.FINAL VERDICT: 3/5 (Or) 4/10 Summary: Boring characters, non-dynamic, no feels.",5
fairy-tail,Fairy tale started out strong and I am happy that they are making more seasons but the last 10 episodes the artworks and quality that was produced before the celestial arc has degraded so much it seems the editors and artist stopped caring and are just pushing it out for more sales now.aside from the beef I listed above I am still an avid fan of fairy tale I do hope they fix that one issue and do a lot more actual character growth beyond the friendship /guild bond link that is  running dry,5
fairy-tail,"I watched all of the first season and it was amazing. I loved every bit of it except for the long filler arc. But now, this new season is the definition of horrible. There used to be awesome fights and great character development and conflict but now each and every episode of the new season makes me wanna do the 2k15 kys challenge. Seriously this anime needs to get back on track with the manga and start producing an actual, serious, and amazing anime.",4
fairy-tail,"(This is my first review, so some things may be a bit flawed).  I was introduced to Fairy Tail by a fellow friend who liked anime.  Although I like it, the chances of me recommending it to someone are low.  Why?  The main reasons are because of the rampant fan service and the overused cliches.Honestly, I don't know how I put up with the fan service, but I somehow manage to do so.  First, let's start with the guys.  More than 90% are ripped or very close to it, even to the point in which a 13 year old is also ripped.  The only person I haven't seen like this in the series is a fat person.  However, the problem I have is with the girls.  When I watched the first episode, I noticed that Lucy was quite buxom, but I took that as an exception.  However, I noticed that 99% of the girls have DD breasts.  And don't call me a pervert, since I am a heterosexual female.  What is worse is that whenever they (as in the few girls you see in a serious fight) get attacked, their clothes get ripped.  I know, it' realistic and all, but it gets ripped in the wrong places, so that the only part of their boobs being covered is their nipples.  This goes to Lucy in particular, since she is unfortunately used for most of the fan service in the series.But the most important reason I don't recommend this is because of the cliched storylines.  The only person who never follows this is Lucy (again, I know).  As you know, the protagonist gets beaten down by a typically sadistic antagonist.  But when they remember the power of nakama, they get an irrational sense of power and somehow beat a person who was 10x as strong as them.  This usually goes for Gray, Erza and of course, Natsu.Anyway, long story short, I still like Fairy Tail because sometimes (as in 15% of the time) the arcs do give you the feels and also because of what some people may call slapstick jokes (I tend do have a liking for anime that is slightly lighthearted, but not much so).  But I wouldn't recommend this series to someone looking for a more mature and intricate plot.",5
fairy-tail,"I started out ignoring Fairy Tail just like i did Naruto way back in the day. Always saw it at anime con's and said i would eventually try and watch it... or there was too much hype and it probably wasn't that good. About a couple months ago i finally sat down and watched the first episode and i was instantly hooked. Fairy Tail just cracks me up. I literally will be laughing out loud at all the humor that they having good on in the show. Great Humor, Great Characters- appeals to your emotions. NOT for kids like someone previously mentioned! Especially how much sexual humor comments they make note to lol. Would you let your kid watch it? Don't think so. Of course every show is going to have characters that you're not very fond of, characters you love and such- it wouldn't be a good show if it didn't. Speaking from a fan who watched 7 seasons in about a month or so- (and is also a fan of the other big time shows One Piece, Naruto etc...) i'll say that Fairy Tail progresses in it's own fashion. You ALSO need to keep in mind that One Piece, DBZ, Naruto etc- have been going for MUCH longer than Fairy Tail almost all of them have ended. So while it may seem that the development in those shows progressed faster it really didn't. They all were around what? 500-600 episodes? Fairy Tail is on early 200's. It's STILL growing. The point in a story is that it is different. The author isn't worried about how fast DBZ, Naruto and One Piece character's have developed he's worried about developing his own characters at his own speed. So bottom line is- if you aren't down with his writing and have nothing but complaints there a millions of other series out there for you. He writes and draws for those who are interested and i'm definitely a fan through it all. I heard some not so great things are going to happen to the Fairy Tail Guild but i won't spoil it and i definitely won't stop reading/watching because i'm a true fan! Enough said!",4
fairy-tail,"Just to be clear, Fairy Tail is still in my queue and I intend to continue watching it someday but now I'm 16 episodes behind and I have yet to feel the urge to do so. Why is that? Is it because there are so many strong series this season? Maybe. Or maybe it's because I get it. I get the story. The writers have gotten every arc down to a single formula and it gets old. The story is so incredibly cookie cutter that while watching the first season, I skipped huge chunks of the story (~4 arcs)  and I came back and realized that I missed nothing of importance. I still got it. When I continued after skipping there was maybe 3 new faces whose names and allegiances I learned after a mere 1 episode. I missed nothing substantial which may give an idea that the story in and of itself is not substantial and fallen falls flat in many aspects.",5
fairy-tail,"Ok, at first i liked this anime A LOT, like to the point of no return or so i thought. after the 2nd season i started noticing a bunch of flaws.1. fan service, people this show is seriously aimed for kids, not perverts looking to have a good time, i can name two woman that have small chests. Even a twelve year old has a somewhat big chest.2. Repetitive, ""I will never give up, I'll fight for my comrades until I win!' boy how many times have I heard a quote like that? EVERY SINGLE ARC like no joke. the plot over and over is, 1. Bad guys show up2. Bad guys start to beat the snot out of main characters 3. Main characters make a big speech about the power of comrades and friendship4. Main characters beat the snot out of the bad guysBoy is that an annoying plot after a while 3. Lucy, this girl is supposed to be one of the most powerful celestial mages in the world. Yet why is she always getting saved by someone? She can not fight at all, and it irritates me like crazy. She'll always get beat up and then be saved by Natsu or someone. Like why can't this girl even lunch someone? Its like she's there for fan service only. When she gets beat up she always has to have some article of clothing ripped apart so only one little string covers her chest. One time she just flew in the air nude. Ugh that annoyed me a lot. So in the end, i can't watch the second season with out rolling my eyes and making a remark about how annoying Lucy is and mimic them talking about their ""nakama""",4.5
fairy-tail,"Fairy tail is a shonen genre show about friendship. It has everything: comedy, action, drama, suspense, romance etc... But it lacks depth and uniqueness. This show is full of reused and rehashed typical anime tropes. There are numerous characters that aren't fleshed out. The battles are redundant. The characters are drawn with ""fan service"" in mind. There are sympathetic villains. There are themes of revenge, troubled childhoods, teen angst etc... There is a formula to this show and it does not change. And once you watch one arc, you can pretty much guess how future story arcs are going to pan out. All of what I just stated isn't a complaint or a criticism. It is what it is. And personally, I don't mind the ""typical"" tropes that this show is full of. The reason why? Because the art style is good. Because the animation and battles are decent. Because ""some"" of the characters are really fleshed out and interesting. There are genuinely dark, deep, and realistically emotional moments in this show that are brilliantly written and shown. The only problem is that there are only a few, handful, of these moments that give you ""the feels"".So, like the title of this review, Fairy Tail is an entertaining show. It does what it sets out to do, and that is to entertain the viewer for the duration of the episode. The target audience age for this show, and shonens in general, are teen - late teen. But I'm in my early 20s and have really enjoyed this show. Also, both girls and guys can enjoy this show. The ""fan service"" goes both ways (although slanted to be more appealing to boys).So I ""personally"" rate this show 4 stars. But for the sake of a somewhat unbiased review, I will give it 3.",4.5
fairy-tail,"Fairy Tail and its anime adaption had tons of potential. I've watched almost 200 episodes of the anime, but I'm now ready to drop it. The author has consistently proven he'll ruin his coolest ideas and I'm tired of watching that happen. From the very beginning, the show has suffered from one and only one problem. You could argue there are more problems, but most of those stem from the one: There are simply too many characters. The chances have been plenty to reduce the cast from growing, but it's become apparent that Mashima Hiro can't bring himself to kill his darlings. The roster of names and faces has bloated beyond reason and it's impacting every aspect of the show.As much as I enjoy many of the characters, ""kill your darlings"" is not only a good rule for writers, it's a philosophy that's intertwined with greater ideals of art. The piece of work is more important than your personal feelings. You don't control the characters, you only interpret them. As an author, you need to respect their space and choices and you should let them live and die as who they are.Pacing is one of the most difficult aspects of writing. It takes tons of editing to fit every moving piece into its place. Fairy Tail characters are so numerous that the pacing is all over the place, the scenes will switch at inappropriate moments, scenes will end without any actual twist or personal resolution, dialogue is becoming repetitive, and I'm ready to give up. The story arcs feel stretched too thin and it's destroying the atmosphere in every scene. The characters you actually give a shit about can't even get enough screen time, because the supporting cast keeps butting in.You can love Fairy Tail. Personally, I'm done giving this show breaks.",5
idolish7,"Idolish 7 was originally a mobile game released by Bandai Namco in Japan, featuring a visual novel and rhythm game type game play. It is a Japanese only mobile game, however you can play it if you live in other countries to find out how visit the Idolish 7 fan wiki. But anyway onto the review, this show so far is great! The animation is smooth and the music and sounds are nice as-well. And all the characters are colorful and have distinct personalities. And I especially like that they did give Tsumugi the main female character a  personality because they usually don't and make them very bland. But Tsumugi has character which is nice. And I don't have any complaints. Like I said this is based off a game so I feel like you would be more excited about this anime if you played the game and have listened to the many songs by the idol groups(Idolish7, Trigger, and Re:Vale.). Anyway I recommend this anime if you like idol anime and like bishies.",5
idolish7,"This anime is based off the rhythm and visual novel mobile game released a few years ago in Japan. It has gained a huge following, and for the fans, this anime has been a long time coming! As a fan of the popular Uta no Prince-sama, and a veteran male idol anime watcher, I can honestly say that this one is a serious gem! While following the story of this 7 man idol unit (get it? Idolish7) we start at, just like the idol group, the beginning! It's all about trying to get their name out their, worry over other idol units, and how to work together as a unit themselves. And to of course, be top idols! This anime shows the real struggles of trying to make a name for yourself versus just them ""magically"" becoming the best. They aren't the best right now, they are unknown and are working hard to figure out the entertainment world. I know a lot of idol anime characters tend to lack personalities and/or not have any depth beyond their set image. But with this anime it's not like that at all! Every character (even the main female, I know a total shock) has a set image but they are not one-dimensional in their personalities or struggles! It's a refreshing good idol anime that has good animation (there is some CGI during some dancing parts but it isn't all that bad), plot, music/songs, and actual characters we can sympathizes with and not just annoyed at! I think for any idol lovers and even first time watchers, would be able to enjoy this!",5
idolish7,"I love the characters in this anime - they feel down to earth and not vague in personality - there's something more defined in their ambitions and they have, dare I say, some common sense? It's not just pretty boys living a lavish lifestyle as an idol, they're buckling down and trying to build themselves up from the bottom, but they have such good interactions it feels so refreshing and even relatable to a degree.And, you gotta enjoy that merged first two episodes, it really gives them the time to cement the character dynamics. And our female manager is focusing on her job instead of being in doki doki otome cliche situations, so that's always a plus! I'll be sticking with this in the long run for sure.",5
idolish7,"Honestly, this is the first time I've ever enjoyed an idol anime so much as to watch it past episode five  (coughutanoprincesamacough) and I fell in LOVE. The boys aren't bland and are all extremely charming in their own ways. They all have unique backstories that can really describe why a character acts a certain way! Along with that the main female protagonist doesn't drive me crazy and is actually a girl who can do her job and not be useless. Which makes me glad this isn't a reverse harem, like I love the reverse harem genre, but I hate the trope of the main female being useless. Other than that, the plot is very dramatic but is still filled with some really cute plot points that just keep you watching. Plus just watch the anime. It's bishie galore and it's beautiful!",5
idolish7,"As I read some of the other comments, I realized there were a few saying it was like every other idol otome anime/game. The main girl does not go chasing after the boys at all and they aren't trying to get with her. Of course there are some flirty remarks here and there, but the boys are much more interested in trying to succeed as a group rather than get her to notice them. The mobile game is amazing and I still play it today. Even in the game itself, you aren't trying to get the boys' attention, you're just going through the story as well as the rhythm portion. It's really fun to collect and merge the character cards too!I would recommend both to anyone!",5
idolish7,"IDOLiSH7 is a great anime for many reasons, but I would say its most appealing factor is the amount of effort that went into each character's stories, and how these stories all work well together. The amount of work that went into this anime is easy to see and it's very admirable, not to mention the songs are really catchy and fun. It's an anime where you can't wait to see what happens next, but at the same time it is relaxing to watch. I really hope this series continues for a while!",5
idolish7,"One look at this and one may think that this is your typical idol anime. A group of boys all fall in love with the same girl and their road is laid out to them in a rainbow where their first concert will have thousands of screaming fans just waiting for them. That they will defeat all the previous guys in a battle of popularity and get bigger than them. Blah blah blah. You know, that typical idol stuff.Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideI was surprised. (Spoiler warning just in case. Especially for ONE part. It's small, but it's a bit of a spoiler)I rarely watch anything reverse harem. When I do, I either think its okay and probably never watch it again. IDOLiSH7 has me going back to rewatch episodes while waiting for the next episode. This idol anime actually has a plot. SHOCKER! Though I can say that some stuff may be slightly exaggerated, many of the small details are based on real life in a way. The way the fans are portrayed; the struggles to be in the idol industry; how personal problems are dealt with (not all but some).The best part? The guys didn't fall in love with their female manager (which I'm to assume is ""you"" on the video game). They love their manager as what she is: their manager. There might be a time where one hits on her, but it's not cheesy and it's brushed off. I'm not saying that I usually hate the female protagonist. I don't. But this is refreshing. It's nice to watch an idol or any reverse harem anime where the guys don't ""fall in love"" at first sight.If many don't like the typical plot of an idol anime but want to give one a try, I suggest IDOLiSH7. And I will say, as a fan of a kpop group, this hits me right in the fandom feels. You can't help but love them all.",5
idolish7,"I got into this late and at the suggestion of a friend. I thought it was supposed to be an Utapri ripoff and wasn't that interested for a while. But I was mistaken. The fact that there's seven idols and they're rainbow colored is about where the similarities end. This isn't really an otome show, and that makes it a breath of fresh air. It's rich in terms of drama and incredibly funny moments and the characters each have so much going for them that it's hard to choose a favorite. If Nana and Utapri had a lovechild, it might be this show. I haven't gotten this into an anime in many years. It's splendidly made and has catchy songs as a great bonus.",5
idolish7,"I've followed IDOLiSH7 since before the anime aired and watching it has only made me appreciate it even more. TROYCA has done an excellent job capturing the heart of i7 and bringing the story to life in a whole new way. If you're even a little curious, me and this 5 star rating highly recommend you give it a try!I dearly love this series and I am heavily anticipating season 2! Please. I love Re:vale so much and I want to see them so bad.",5
idolish7,"So I watched this because I've played the game since it released because I'm a total sucker for rhythm games, especially those that have Ono Kensho, Egutan and Kenn in them, haha. Honestly - this is probably one of the best idol anime. Period. And I hate idol anime. There's a real plot that follows the game very well, and the characters are actually all developed. The animation is a bit more... bishouneny than something like Shounen Hollywood, but it has that same feel where the characters are real people with real problems. Do I think this falls short in the fact that everything is a little bit grand? Yes - but it's not like an otome (this doesn't really feel otome beyond the manager is a girl and there are only other male characters, they don't all compete for her affection, there are only subtle nods to its genre) where there is inexplicable magic and rainbows. It is more of a over-emphasized version of what the entertainment industry in Japan is really like, while still having some truth and classic anime drama in it. It's really well done, and the animation is consistent for the most part. Plus the songs are really fun and good, if you're into that.",5
idolish7,"I originally started watching this anime because I felt like indulging in something mindless and kind of ridiculous. The first episode is silly, but as the show goes on you slowly start to get engrossed in the characters and their shenanigans. What I once watched ironically I now genuinely enjoy. I've watched every episode at least twice. Is it a silly idol show? Yes. Is it a great silly idol show? Absolutely. (Also the songs are really catchy and I listen to them... a lot...)",5
idolish7,IDOLiSH7 is a mobile otome/rhythm game that many have loved for years now and we have all been asking and asking for there to be an anime and there finally was. As expected the dancing is CGI which to me is the only downside of the whole thing. However the great voice acting (same actors as the ones in the game) and beautiful art style make it all the worth watching. I can't wait to watch more and fall more in love with some of my favorite characters.Riku Nanase is my favorite out of them all by the way.,5
idolish7,"When I watched the first episode, my thoughts were: ""Oh, this is going to be like Uta no Prince Sama. Reverse harem set-up, and cute boys with a solid reason to not actually go after the MC, because, y'know, idol contracts.""I have never been so happy to be wrong!In hindsight, the comparison is a complete disservice to the show.  The characters are all dynamic and feel seriously real; The idol stuff they do feels very down to earth and I love it; There's no reverse harem!!! Just people being people, getting along, forming relationships, like, wow. Clear and pure friendships? In front of my salad? Amazing. Like dang, can't believe they made a female protagonist not get crushes every .5 seconds while not realizing it at the same time. Or have the shockingly talented and good-looking idols fall in love with our average but oh-so-talented MC after she breathes.Another thing that I adore about the show, is their CG.  It's shockingly good, like I was not expecting to be able to watch 90% of the CG parts without having my soul slowly wither away.Also! The voices! Everyone who sang sounded pretty good, like, not actual idol good obviously, but it was really impressive. The songs were also overall enjoyable!If I had to pick out something I didn't like, it would be how Iori takes control of a lot of things that, as manager, Tsumugi ought to be doing herself. If not entirely, than mostly.  However I can also see that as being just how they are, for both characters: Iori is used to having everything he does be perfect, so it would make sense that he can be rather imposing with his ideas and suggestions.  Tsumugi is shy, and whatever confidence she had in her management abilities takes a huge hit within the first few episodes as well.I might not be an avid consumer of idol anime, but this one is undoubtedly great and I hope that more people give it a chance.",5
idolish7,"This is the anime of the year for me, this is really amazing in my opinion. It is just so down to earth and genuine feeling, combine that with an excellent story and rare spot on directory/script making - this is seriously something special and I feel bad for anybody who'd miss it because it doesn't seem like what they were looking for. If you lke drama shows you should give the first episode a try.It was made with pure passion and love, there isn't anything about it that feels stilted and like it was inserted just to please the viewers. That's kinda rare, and if you can recall really great shows, that's usually the case with them.The story is pleasanly creative and keeps surprising you, I love that so much. The characters always feel down to earth and realistic, which gives the kyonai effect. Since it's all down to earth and not exaggeraeted, you connect to it, and when things happen you feel them with no need for dramatic music or over the top crying or whatever - the characters can say what a real person would and it impacts you emotionally just as much.The animation is fantastic, it looks great, imo the lives are the best anime idol lives in anime history. In a second watch you can notice details that aren't good in them, where as in Love Live it's all clean and beautiful, but in the first watch that's not what you see, and the motion capture they used for the dancing and the effects they used for the visuals work brilliantly to bring a gush of excitement just like the crowd gets. Seriously, if you analyse the lives' shots you can notice there was a lot of attention to using them well to convey the excitement, with characters moving loosely around the frame to show the wild dancing, or showing fans overjoyed in the right moments for an impact. It's seriously a work of art.The background music is new too, they used more like DJ/american or something sounding stuff for the more lighthearted tracks and it's really cool, it sounds great and it's a mix up from what I'm used to hear.The comedy is hilarious, oh my god. The spot on directory I mentioned earlier helps that a lot. The timing of the lines and sounds can be really perfect and it's really funny. The jokes are great one by one, even my mom laughed out loud as I described some of them to her.I wish I could say it is really a 10/10 but I know there are tiny imperfections that would bother some that I easily didn't mind. Sometimes they try to set up information about future stuff and it goes over your head and you just wonder what the point of that talk is. That happened heavily in episode 2 which made me think ""oh, so it is a regular idol show after all?"" but no no no no. Luckily it happened pretty rarely after episode 2 so that's fun. It's also imperfect how EVERYBODY has some drama stuff attached to them, like that's very fun to watch but admittedly it's not that realistic. I think it was handled so well though that I really doubt anybody would mind that, none of the drama is drama just for the sake of being serious - it all has great messages and was done organically, it all feels like genuinely good drama that genuinely fits the characters and enhances the story. I feel like I can't complain, but idk, maybe somebody else would.Anway, as I said, I think this is amazing, I think it's pretty groundbreaking. I hope it will gain the popularity it deserves, and I hope other studios will mark this as inspirational. It was clearly made with a lot of love and passion, very organically and with 0 fanservice in mind. It just makes it incredibly good, you wanna keep going on and on and you feel for them so much. I'm gonna get the blu-ray because I want more seasons, please try the first episode! If you feel hooked at the beginning but it fades off in peisode 2, don't drop it! I felt like that too, from episode 3 and on it's a steady ride.",5
idolish7,"One of the greatest shows to kick back and watch when you're avoiding your larger responsibilities in life.  Definitely worth watching if you want a melodramatic but funny experience with seven singing boys (who arguably represent the seven deadly sins, in my opinion) and the trio of much more attractive boys who sometimes oppose them.  Even the boring members turn out to have something interesting to bring to the table.  It's good.",5
idolish7,"This show was great and I was glad I watched it. This series showed the struggles and the emotions of stars trying to reach to the top. It made you understand each character and learn about them, even the minor ones like the fangirls! I loved how the rivals were also supporting, unlike most shows which only focuses on the rival's bad sides. It made you fall in love with both idol groups, and in the end, wanting both of them to become the best they can be. At the end of the series, I felt like I've known each character, but still hungry for more. One of the best idol shows I've ever watched!",5
idolish7,"This Idol anime is well designed, animated, and thought out. The progression doesn't feel off. The characters feel unique but familiar and are interesting. The dynamics between the cast remains fresh and interesting because of their different ideologies and back grounds. While I still prefer Uta-Pri, this is right up there in the top of my anime lists. The story is so good, the characters interesting, the music is fun and makes me feel like I'm at a concert.",5
idolish7,"I'm not usually one for idol franchises in general, but IDOLiSH7 has completely won me over. Even though everyone's pretty formulaic at the start - each boy has a color, number, musical symbol, and key characteristic, if you will - you start getting hints and pieces of what lies beneath their bright, hopeful shiny exterior. After watching the first episode, I did go download and play the game, so I'm eagerly awaiting Season 2 as we get even more in depth into each of the boys backgrounds and stories!",5
idolish7,Idolish7 is one of the best anime I have ever seen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,5
idolish7,"Holy crap, this is an amazing show. It is absolute perfection in pacing, animation, voice acting and music quality, and I fell in love with every single character, from the main manager character to every single one of the idol group, the rival characters, and even the side fan characters.The fact that this is one of those animes based on a dating sim/rhythm/mobile games comes as a shock. These types of animes are often plagued with terrible characters and plot, where the main avatar character is so bland so as to be completely spineless and detestable, and the idols are left with so little characterization they might as well be overdressed scenery, all the while insisting that we're supposed to like and be invested in these characters.This anime falls prey to none of that, and has genuinely moving moments. Without giving away any spoilers, I found myself laughing and cheering along with their successes, as well as feeling completely devastated by their setbacks. It's so rare to find an anime capable of getting me this invested these days, much less one based on a mobile game.You do not have to play the game to love this anime or understand what's going on. It is wonderful and stands on its own. If you're looking your next anime about camaraderie and overcoming struggles together, you need to watch this right now!",5
idolish7,"First time when I watch this anime, I was thinking that whoever made this... the guys seem to be very pathetic and weak. My interest to watch it decreases. But, I think after watching the first episodes. I could not stop watching it! They are funny in their own way even though they are very immature and not professional like the other bands. They have never hated them or make the other bands as their rivals. Instead, they always learn from them and take their career to success.",5
idolish7,there are a lot of idol animes out there that promise good music and well the japanese idol experience. as someone who went to some of the concerts the cgi on most at the concerts are horrible and that one thing i can appreciate that they did not to that. also the story is really great. there are a real progression of the characters and story. i really love how the season end and they are not stars. the one thing i worry is the second season many times they just start the gimmicky songs and season. i appreciate there no reverse harem aspect and just idols. i hope next season does not disappoint.,5
idolish7,"Really enjoyed the first 1-2 Episode being combined and not extremely rushed. While they still used CGI for the concert performance scenes it didn't feel nearly as static as a lot of the other current singing series with their CGI. Was a lot smoother and felt like it had more ""moves"" although they weren't entirely in sync since it was only their first performance. More reasonable as in new band - not many fans yet and working hard to get your name out there ect. Looking for more character development but definitely will be keeping this one in my Queue.",5
idolish7,"I mean, what to say? If that's what you're into, go for it. If not, don't bother like always. If you're expecting anything different or original, don't. Last original idol anime that interested me was Shonen Hollywood. IDOLiSH7 has the same idol formula, with hot trope guys, one being your typical blonde-hair, blue-eyed, pale skin white gaijin, and then there's your main female lead who's supposed to be you reflected in the character, but half the time the girl is just too shy. There is CGI for dancing animation, music, glitter, fangirl squeals, guys getting with the girl, etc etc. So basically, it's not for me, but it might be for you. If so, don't be ashamed and have fun with it.",5
mob-psycho-100,"Seriously, are you debating watching this show? Stop and just watch it. Actually here's a few questions to help you decide.Did you like one punch man?Yes - You'll love thisNo - Keep readingHave you ever dreamed about having psychic powers?Yes - You'll love thisNo - Keep readingHave you always wanted to see a no holds barred fight between Alakazam and Mewtwo?Yes - You'll love thisNo - Keep readingDo you enjoy stupid looking main characters that are humorously OP?Yes - You'll enjoy thisNo - Stop reading and reconsider your life choices.",5
mob-psycho-100,"All I have heard about this anime is hype, hype, hype.  ""A new story by the same creator as One Punch Man"" ""It's going to be so OP!""  ""It's going to be the best show this season, probably this year"" etc.So how good is Mob Psycho 100?  Short Answer: It's pretty amazing, but I'm pissed I have to wait for season 2.Long Answer:Let's start with the story:The main plot starts with Reigen Arataka who claims to be an psychic who can exorcise ghosts/spirits.  After we quickly learn he has no gifts whatsoever, he calls in his student Mob, real name Kageyama Shigeo, to finish a job for him.  Mob is a true  and powerful psychic who easily destroys the ghost Reigen was hired to exorcise.  Reigen collects most of the money from the job, giving Mob a small amount in change.  Mob doesn't seem bothered by this since Reigen explains that ghost was a low level spirit he could have easily handled and he's just letting Mob get experiance. However, shortly after this we see a caption titled ""Progress Toward Mob's Explosion: 22%""Mob has amazing psychic powers, but like Saitaman from One Punch Man (sorry I feel like it's impossible not to compare), few people actually recognize it.  Mob's parents would like him to stop bending spoons and Mob's fellow classmates ignore him because he sleeps in class, has no athletic ability, and is socially inept.  The plotline of this show goes in so many directions, espically in the early episodes. The craziness was entertaining to me becuase I never really knew what to expect.  For me, all the plot twists and character twists made Mob Psycho 100 worth watching on its own, but I also have to give a shout-out to the art becuase it's amazing.The Animation/Art:One of the things that hit me immediately with this anime is the art style.  You can really see One in it.  One is the creator of both One Punch Man and Mob Pyscho 100, however One Punch Man was redrawn by Yusuke Murata.  The anime of One Punch Man was based off Yusuke Marata's art.  On the other hand Mob Pyscho 100 has always kept One as its author and artist.  So, you can see One's art style much more in Mob Pyscho 100.  Let's be honest; One is not the best manga artist.  That said, art is in the eye of the beholder.  One's art style is unique and interesting.  Add in studio Bones and a good animation budget, and you get a pretty good looking anime that has a unique flare to it.Music:I'm no expert in the musical realm but, I think the music is pretty awesome.  I watch the opening every time because it's catchy and I always find something new to look at in the hypnotic visuals.  Mob's psychic fight scenes have this cool borderline Indian music that sounds mysterious but also gets you amped up.  Character Development:*Just be be clear I'm refering to character develop as 'changes in a character over the course of the narrative' i.e. character dymanics, not expanding the veiwers knowledge of a character.This is one of the few shows I can think of where secondary characters go through dramatic changes in character (even more so than the main characters.  Bad people turn good and good guys turn bad.  And the reasons why they change make sense. It's another one of the aspects of Mob Psycho 100 that keeps you one your toes.Comedy to Seriousiness Balance:Mob Psycho 100 is a comedy, but it gets a little more serious than One Punch Man.  It likes to end on comedic notes, but dives into deeper psychologic issues than a pure comedy show.  I found myself laughing its one-line and slap-stick style jokes, but it shines at satircal comedy.  If you thought One Punch man had good comedy you'll like Mob Psycho 100.If that all was too much to read throughReasons to Watch Mob Psycho 100:-Crazy plot-Funny-Interesting characters-Cool art-Great Opening-Intense fight scenesDon't Watch Mob Psycho 100 If:-You hate uncompleted shows (but there is a guaranteed 2nd season)-You hate rollercoaster shows that are too crazy and move too fast-You're a hipster that will automatically hate anything that is popularOne last piece of advice: Keep watching until the very end of the second episode.  The first episode is very directionless and nothing unexpected happens until the end of episode 2.  Episode 3 finally dives into some cool fight scenes and they get even more intense after that.",5
mob-psycho-100,"So surprisingly, it has been awhile since the end run of One Punch Man, a series that literally had every one laughing their heads off as they were cultivated by an egg headed god running around destroying enemies (with one punch of course) and creating misunderstandings everywhere. While everyone waits on a season 2 (which let's be fair here, we won't see it for a long time)[EDIT: Okay I did say that when I first wrote this review, but OPM did just get greenlit for a season 2 so. Maybe it will come sooner than expected. Anyway, moving forward.]there are always going to be new shows to talk about. Madhouse has moved on to create shows like Prince of Stride, Alderamin In The Sky and in the future I think they have a show called All Out scheduled for release.  Erased and Ajin came around in the Winter season, and both of those shows left a pretty good impact on the community as well. Twin Star Exorcists came out and showed everyone that Pierrot cares about all of it's works except for Naruto (although I guess the filler is pretty popular in Japan, so I guess they do care). Bones had just finished up their adaptation of Boku Hero No Academia which if you haven't seen that, please go do so it's pretty awesome. However Bones wasn't satisfied enough for the year after giving us a great show like that. No they had to take it ""ONE"" step further (see what I did there?) and keep the momentum rolling with the airing of Mob Psycho 100, created by the very same being who created One Punch Man. And after seeing the first episode to say I was ultra super happy would be kind of an understatement. So being already caught up to the web comic, Mob Psycho 100 definitely shows plenty of promise to build the hype train. Sure it won't do as much as One Punch Man did, but given the studio behind it, and the fact that Yoshimichi Kameda is involved (did key animation for some no name works like Evangelion 3.0, Soul Eater, FMA Brotherhood and oh yeah One Punch Man), it definitely spells great things to come out of the show. So what is Mob Psycho 100 about? Well to be pretty simple, It's about a middle school boy named Shigeo Kageyama, who just wants to live a normal life. The kicker is however, he is a super powerful esper, a being with psychic abilities. Although he would like to keep this power a secret, some people are aware of his abilities. His family knows about them, and another person named Reigen Arataka knows about them. Reigen is what you could call..... a fraud. And I'm pretty sure a lot of people who aren't familiar with the web comic aren't too fond of him from the first episode alone, but thankfully the series does build on his character, and to be honest for me, he's probably my favorite character in the entirety of the series (just like a TINY bit higher than Mob, for reasons I cannot say because then I would have to spoil it...... and no one likes spoilers (for the most part)). Anyway, Reigen runs an exorcism clinic of sorts, and although he claims he can exorcise any spirit that comes his way, he kiiinda has to call out to Mob for some help.... and by some I mean all the time, at least when the table salt solution fails (which it does). Mob does get paid, roughly a little bit more than your standard waiter / waitress an hour. So basically you could almost consider it slave labor, but apparently to Mob, he doesn't mind it so much. Another thing you may have noticed is that percentage that ticks off until Mob's explosion. Mob is basically bottling up his feelings as he goes about his daily life, but as you can see from the first episode, any time his stress builds up, the percentage meter towards his explosion does the same. As you would expect, once that meter hits 100, he loses control and well..... and explosion happens. Mob does his best to keep these powers suppressed, but there are always going to be people that will push his buttons unknowingly aware of what might happen to them. All in all I have high hopes for this series, the animation is great considering the source material (and honestly after reading it for awhile now the web comic material is actually pretty nice as well, despite what people might say about it), the music has a really cool vibe to the show, and the opening and endings get you so hype for the episode and for the next. Do I think Mob Psycho 100 is going to live up to the hype of One Punch Man? Probably not, because One Punch is a different beast. However that being said, I think the show will be great enough to stand and earn high praises on it's own when it's all said and done, rather than staying the shadow of the gargantuan that is OPM that came before it. Also for additional stuff, I had just read a conversation between the director Yuzuru Tachikawa and ONE discussing the series being adapted, I think it's pretty cool, and kind of gives you a gist of what may occur in the show in the future.",5
mob-psycho-100,"Just so we're clear, Mob is by no means a repeat of One Punch Man, though I don't think I would complain even if it was.One Punch Man and Mob Psycho are both stories about insanely powerful characters, and while OP man ends there, Mob Psycho delves much deeper.On the outside, Mob is a comedy about a lackluster middle-school student. As we grow to know Mob, we discover a child who is horrified of his own power... When he allows himself to experience the most human part of his being - his emotions - that power is swells beyond the point he can control, so he suppresses his emotions - in essence, his humanity - at all costs. Despite this complex, he is still a teenage boy who desires acceptance and confidence. Before Mob realizes it, he finds himself surrounded by a cast of endearing characters who place their confidence in him, spurring him on to discover his own potential and, in so doing, his own humanity.PLEASE, do yourself the favor of watching this show. You'll be glad you did.",5
mob-psycho-100,"Mob Psycho 100 is a showcase of the best things anime has to offer and is the epitome of great storytelling, animation, pacing, character development, comedy, and of course, ACTION. The MC is lovable. The characters are hilarious, creative, and well thought out, development-wise. The action scenes will pump adrenaline through your veins so fast, there should be a warning for addicts. This anime will make you laugh. It will make you cry. It will make you say OMG WTF ROFLCOPTER many times. Regardless of the preference one may have when it comes to genres, this show is to be watched by anyone and everyone who has ever even heard of what anime is. To do otherwise would be doing a great disservice to both the show and yourself. 10/10 stars",5
mob-psycho-100,"The animation is phenomenal, the art is great, the story is intact. And while I can see the comparisons to One Punch Man coming, these are very different series, that look the same at a glance. in general, Mob Psycho is much more serious, especially since One Punch Man started as a joke manga as a test of some page layout software, whereas this is what the author originally had (and arguably still has) as his main series.In short, give it a shot, because this is going to be one of those series that keeps getting better",5
mob-psycho-100,"From the first 2 episodes you could have easily dropped it and assumed that the series would just turn for the worse. But after the initial build up from the very basics of character development and such the anime had turned up to 10. In the most recent episodes you can see the plot becoming more defined and the overall writing shining through. If you want to give it a real try, dont just watch the first 2 episodes, at least watch the first 4 or 5 then make a decision. I initially was skeptical because of the first episode because of cringey Reigen and bland character, but it turned up to 10 and all the characters have grown on me a little more. There are a lot of emotions that can be derived from the show, and I believe that people are mistaking the art style for a simple attempt at a comedy, but I believe its a whole lot more than that. At first glance you'd tihnk it would try to go for comedy through and through but in reality I think it just makes it distinguished and gives the characters originality and present a more metaphorical approach to display each character's struggles. IMO this is more on the serious end, but with  anot very serious feel, definitely makes you think and makes you feel. Give it a try :D:D:D one of my tops for the season.",5
mob-psycho-100,"If you've seen  One Punch Man, then you know what to expect. Mob knows that he's the most powerful. Yet it's not his defining trait. He's hardly even a protagonist- he's just a small, weak kid, with no friends, few skills, and no physique. But he has a kind heart, a curious mind, and not an ounce of guile in him.Couple this with psychic powers like that of a god, and you have a character that you can root for.Overall, the meat-and-potatoes of this series isn't the flashy use of awesome cosmic power; it's the small kindnesses, the personal revelations, the growth and changing of the characters in front of you. In this, it surpasses One Punch Man's anime by far.It might start a little slow, but this anime is almost sure to make you laugh, cheer, and think. And isn't that worth investing a little time in?",5

mob-psycho-100,"For starters, the openings are some of the best I've ever seen, and the animation is flawless. (Thank you studio BONES). This show somehow managed to entangle epic battle scenes in with heart-heavy emotional outbursts. The plot is extremely immersive, and all of the characters feel like they've been worked on and perfected for years. Mob and Reigen's relationship alone have made this a stand-out work in its genre. There isn't a single person I wouldn't recommend this show to. Seriously, it's THAT good. But don't take my word for it, see for yourself!",5
mob-psycho-100,"I was never planning on watching this anime, and honestly I should have watched it sooner. I wasn't going into this anime expecting much, but honestly, I don't regret a thing.I have nothing but good things to say about this anime, and I'm sure this is the kind of anime anyone could enjoy. It has lovable characters, leaving you to cry and to laugh along with them. The story may seem cliche to some, but what about a seemingly normal middle school boy with psychic powers seems cliche? Some of the animation is overly gorgeous for an anime with such a simplistic style. Its hard not to find yourself with a stupid grin on your face after finishing this anime, as I have ended up this way too, and most likely, so will you.Overall this is simply an anime anyone can enjoy. I can not recommend this enough, as I couldn't stop watching it, and binged it in 2 days. If you have not already, you are massively missing out.",5
mob-psycho-100,"Don't compare this anime to one punch man, it's similar but not the same. Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideMob may be OP but he's a below average middle school student with no friends, no particular skill, and no confidence. The only thing he has is his telekinesis powers. And EVEN SO, he doesn't want to use it because he's afraid to hurt people. Okay, I'm done with spoilers.So this is what I think. The art is different and not for everyone. But please give it a go, it's a hilarious anime with a heart warming protagonist. It would suck for you to give it up just because you don't like the art.",5
mob-psycho-100,"This anime was very, very enjoyable. Mob Psycho 100 manages to combine hilarious comedy with surprisingly appropriate thought behind it. Reigen is a fake front and center, but is also a true mentor to Mob. Mob is inherently flawed but works through it, and takes from Reigen his outlook on his powers. Mob's brother Ritsu has his own complexities, which, if mentioned, would spoil the story. All in all, each character in this story felt deep, thought out, expressive, flawed, and thus true. The character development in just twelve episodes is impressive to say the least, and truly inspiring. Bones did a fantastic job animating this story and I am impressed fully.I give this anime a 9/10 for story, character and hilarity. I highly recommend anyone considering watching this to do so, and quickly. A second season is projected to be released in early 2019, and I, for one, am excited.Thank you again, and I hope you will give this anime a chance.",5
mob-psycho-100,"No spoilers. As the title says, going from 0 to 100, on the obvious side, is hinting on the main character's ability, it also perfectly describes the story's progression itself. The reason that I say this is, when you first get into the story, you may not find something that is striking enough to make you realize how amazing this series is. But if you are patient enough to finish the whole story, you will get a great amount of emotional explosion in the end. The whole story is actually powerful and beautiful at the same time. That's something you may never expect(at least me) in the start of this series. Mob psycho 100 is a well thought comedy with in-depth slice of life and appropriate action sequences. Different with OPM focusing more on actions and comedy, MP100 has more in-depth character portraits and story telling. All the characters have their prominent personalities to make them stand out. Every pieces of the story fits perfectly together and the messages are really uplifting. Comparing with its supernatural setting, the story itself feels surprisingly realistic. You can easily feel for these characters and miss them so much after it ended. This anime, from the animation to the storytelling, is such a breath of fresh air. Personally speaking, this story has almost everything that I want from this type of anime. It reminds me a lot of one of the reasons that I love about anime, that anime has such potential to use its technique to make unrealistic stories impactful and reflect enduring struggles and emotions in real life situations. Mob Psycho did everything right for this type of story.",5
mob-psycho-100,"This review is spoiler-free.Okay, let me start by saying that I realize how trite the title of this review is. People are always trying to proclaim something as ""the next big thing"" way too early. But I honestly do believe that Mob Psycho 100 (and One Punch Man as well) represents the future of anime as a medium and a genre.Let's start with the obvious: the art style. It's not your standardized, perfectly polished animation. Characters often go off-model and some scenes look like they were drawn by a child. The character designs range from generically common to surreally bizarre. But these things are what lend the series a good deal of its charm. The unconventional art adds emotion to every scene, whether it's humor in one of the comedic scenes (which is a majority of them) or gravitas in the more serious ones, such as the fight scenes. Whereas some animated programs seem to use art style as a means to an end, in this series the animation serves the story at every angle.A stand-out feature of the art is the paint-on-glass scenes animated by Miyo Sato as discussed in this article: . These scenes–which include some of the scenes involving spirits and the entirety of the ending sequence–are instantly memorable for their unique style. Mob Psycho 100's inclusion of many different animation styles is part of what makes it so significant. I'm not going to go into a lot of detail about the plot or characters, not because they're not great or not as important as the art, but because I'm sure they've been covered better by other reviews on here. What I do think is more important than the actual details of the story is the theme of it. It boils down to this: (to paraphrase Reigen) people are people. Being special in some way—such as being strong, smart, or popular, or having psychic powers—doesn't make you better or worse than another person. You're still just another human being; and as long as you're not hurting others, you can be or do whatever you want to, even if it's not something you're naturally talented at. In a medium that's chock-full of chosen ones with important destinies to go along with their substantial powers, that's a pretty rare statement.Suffice it to say, I'm very excited about this anime. Not only what it is, but what it represents, and the potential for what it can do for anime as a whole. I'm extremely glad that it's been picked up for a second season and will be waiting for it with bated breath.",5
mob-psycho-100,"Sometimes, the complexity of telling a fully rounded story in a short run can be botched pretty badly.  Anime these days have been doing a sublime job at telling epic stories in 12-16 episodes, and this one is right up there.  Likeable characters, interesting plot and some interesting turns that I hadn't expected.  I'll admit that I jumped to conclusions that have been shoved aside based on your more ""typical"" story devices so far.  That means that this show takes things in interesting directions.The characters are intriguingly likeable right from the moment you meet them, which is greatly appreciated, and in just 7 episodes, the amount of seamless character development has me feeling like I've watched way more, but the overall goodness of the series has me feeling like I've barely begun.  The animation style is experimental and very cool.  I'd compare the animation style somewhat similar to that of maybe Madoka Magika, though still vastly different.  A nice style balance of comedic, horror and supernatural, its a very interesting watch.  And I appreciate the different appearances people have in the show, from main to secondary characters, I like when faces reflect reality - you have the pretty ones and the not so pretty ones.Most of the teenagers are believable in character, which is also something I appreciate.  I always prefer characters to act their age, and I feel like this show, for the most part, accurately depicts what teenagers would be like if they or someone they knew had psychic powers.I gave it a shot because the animation itself intrigued me, but I was sucked in from episode one and have loved every second of it.There is a lot of mediocre stuff out there but this is NOT in that list!",5
mob-psycho-100,"1) first thing i noticed when i watched the first episode was that the animation was on a whole new level. think of unlimited budget works x gintama.2) the theme song and video are amazing, so you know this is going to be good.3) it literally HILARIOUS from the very beginning. i laughed so much (out load, literally for everyone to hear) one of the funniest anime i have ever watched.4) subliminal life lessons that actually have value (but can easily be blocked out if your not into that kinda thing)5) well animated, brilliant op fights.im on episode 6 and have to wait another week to watch 7. im already suffering from withdrall. i didnt want to watch this at all when i saw it to be honest. the first episdoe was great, so was the second, and the third, then i was hooked. its like green eggs and ham, just try it (i dont even like this genre, im more into pure shonen or seinen)",5
mob-psycho-100,"First of all, if you have watched One Punch Man, but have never read the manga, you probably won't know what I'm talking about when I say that ONE's style is more evident in this anime.  However, if you want to know what ONE's style looks like, this is a brilliant way to see it.  Studio Bones has captured that quirky style that a lot of people have come to love, and that is commendable in itself.  Not to mention the bright colors that change based on the mood, making the whole experience more exciting to the eye.   However, some people think the animation is horrible, and I can respect their opinion.  This is a very shallow statement that people use when they simply don't enjoy the style.  As an animator myself, I love watching new styles popping up from different studios.  So, if you are into a more natural and expressive animation style, this is the show for you.   The comedy element is definitely still present, albeit a tad darker, but still just as hilarious as One Punch Man.  ONE has yet again managed to make a poker face funny...Next on the list is the story.  So far, it seems like a struggle between Mob's psychic powers and his complicated emotions stemming from puberty.  However, Mob hordes all his feelings inside.  This little trait causes some of the most exciting moments in the series.  Over all, I think it has an awesome plot, and I hope it gets even better as the story continues.  I'm actually excited for Monday now...",5
mob-psycho-100,"It's got good integrity. Some One Punch Man with a pinch of Yu Yu Hakusho!No spoilers here. You can definitely tell this is the work of ONE. The animation is top-notch; they're cutting very few corners. The action is smooth and the visual motion is always interesting. They miss few storytelling opportunities: character flaws become character strengths- and everything fits together under some consistently growing themes. & finally, It seems to have a better dub than most titles!",5
mob-psycho-100,"This show is great because it's action-filled, funny, has a good plot, and a good message. This show is inspiring, but also just funny. I mean have you seen the main characters? The world is being saved by someone in a bowl cut. It's a fictional world, but one that has still changed my perspective on the real one. It's got everything you need in an anime to make it great, this is one of my favorite shows of all time. Oh...and the OP's are bops too.",5
mob-psycho-100,"I have never seen a show execute multiple show elements that many other series often try to tackle alone so flawlessly. Its combination of humor, action, and slice of life blend in perfect harmony to make an irresistible story that keeps you wanting to watch more.Personally, I've never loved a set of characters more than I've loved the wacky cast of MP100. From the Body Improvement Club and the Telepathy Club to the Scars and even the evil spirits, each of them enhance the show in their own unique way no matter how short their screen time may be. The animation, story line, characters, and soundtrack are all incredible individually...And together they've woven the most amazing series I've ever seen to this day.Please give MP100 a watch, it is most definitely worth your time.The only complaint I have is that there's not more episodes!",5
mob-psycho-100,"This is by far the best shounen anime I have ever seen. Loveable characters, including a main character who is both relatable and grows as the story progresses. Gloriously animated fight scenes containing not only impressive but ground-breaking animation. Excellent pacing, no time is wasted on inconsequential battles like many other shounen anime. And the comedic timing and voice-acting also could not be any better. This is a must-watch for ANY anime fan, casual or hardcore.",5
mob-psycho-100,"Great story.One of the best character build up and development as you will see the main character grow and mature - from a troubled teenage boy to a one who has accepted himself realizing his good and bad qualities - embracing them. A lot of teens will definitely relate to Mob (main character).The story is about espers and telekenetic powers but the main plot is not just your common, ordinary anime genre determining who's the strongest of them all but its about responsibility on how to use the power you poses and embracing yourself- that what makes this anime great.",5
mob-psycho-100,"This anime was so good, I seriously would recommend watching it three times over. Its concept is quite interesting as it focuses on the psychic powers of a normal teen boy.The fights are structured nicely and are really interesting to watch, they always keep you craving more. The animation is incredible and the character development is honestly really good. If there somehow is any doubt in your mind even after reading this whether you should watch it or not, just do yourself a favor, and give it a try.",5
mob-psycho-100,"There are small acts of kindness that touches my heart and soul far more poignantly than any tragedy. They are the bright rays of sunshine seeping through the somber haze, the gentle whispers of goodness in a society filled with material wealth and dispassion.Here is a discourse that allows neither escapism nor nihilism. Too often while watching this show do I find myself smiling through the teary eyes, suddenly and absurdly discovering myself a kindlier person living in a more benevolent world; and I pray it'd be the same for you. If your heart ever lead you to the beautiful story that is Mob Psycho 100, let your mind dwell upon it with childlike innocence, let its kindness caress your weathered soul, and let its good faith be the drive to forging yourself a better day.",5
mob-psycho-100,"I was a little cautious at first, wasn't sure if I had liked what I had seen before I started watching. I kept trying to watch the first episode, but would stop for a few minutes. Later on, started seeing more about the show, so I finally decided to watch it. Boy, I completely regret not watching it sooner.The animation is absolutely astonishing, and they aren't afraid to use different mediums to get a joke or a fight seen across. The humor never fails to make me laugh, even during fights. However, it can also take itself very seriously. My favorite fight so far was season 2 episode 5. It was able to use breath taking animation and choreography, but also kept some humor which really made it amazing. To top it all off, the result was truly heart felt, which is another thing this show tends to do. Please, watch this.",5
mob-psycho-100,"When I first tried watching this show, I only got to about episode 3 before I quit.  However once I got past that the action picked up and the characters became far more interesting.  Studio Bones has really outdone themselves with the animation sequences and colorings of this series, especially in Season 2.  Also not gonna lie, the jokes about Bones being Thirsty for Reigen are partially why I came back and finished watching the series.",5
mob-psycho-100,"mob psycho 100 is a story about a boy called mob who has psychic abilities. We follow his story as he tries to lead a normal life doing things like making friends, joining school clubs, having crushes, working a part time job with a shifty business man that has a heart of gold and having intense psychic battles with people who think theyre better then everyone else because they have powers. Now if any of that appeals to you then your gonna love this anime. Why are you still here go watch it!",5
mob-psycho-100,The combination of slice-of-life with comedy and shounen-style battles is just perfect. The art style is slightly off-putting at first but after a few episodes becomes familiar and charming. The voice acting is top notch. Some of the best performances ever. The fight scenes are beautifully animated. You will fall in love with the characters immediately. Especially Reigen. Reigen is prime tier husbando material and I just wanna give Mob a big hug. Please watch.,5
mob-psycho-100,"It rarely happens that the second season of any anime tops the first season season but its not the case with the Mob Psycho 100, because its clearly improves over 1st season artistically and story-wise too. Mob Psycho 100 is lucky that its not being handled by any other studio than Bones because otherwise it might not have gotten the same treatment that its getting here, any other studio might have changed the director for the second season and all know how well that sits with anime fans.",5
mob-psycho-100,Action - CheckParanormal - CheckSlice of Life - CheckOver the top comedy - CheckShonen coming of age - CheckRomance - Kinda... working on it?It's kind of like if One Punch Man took itself lowkey seriously and was a PKer. The main character suffers from being over powered but he knows it. He often loses based on principals he's placed on himself or via his mentor.... A scam artist PKer.,5
mob-psycho-100,"I'm known to be quite a picky anime-watcher, but this one really hits the spot. First of all, the animation is gorgeous! Although it can be a little bit crude sometimes, the fight scenes are incredibly dynamic and Mob's psychic powers are captured in a beautiful style. Also, the characters are unique and interesting. Especially Mob. He can be seen as a tad bit dull, but his inner conflict and personality is quite deep and surprisingly moving. Finally, the humor. It does miss the mark occasionally, but it works with the tone of the series quite well. 10/10 anime!",5
mob-psycho-100,"This anime is AMAZING! This is from the same people who made One Punch Man, so it's not wonder I instantly fell in love. The visuals are excellent. The depth is excellent. The plot is excellent! Everything about this is absolutely wonderful! I had so much fun watching this. From the very first episode I was mesmerized. I could not put this anime to rest. What started as just a random anime I picked to see with my friend easily made it into my Top 10. Mob is an awkward kid with psychic powers and I love his character not just because of how overpowered he is, but because he is genuinely well-rounded, and no I'm not just talking about his head. He tries his hardest to keep from stressing out which is easily relatable. He is practically a robot upon first impression, but you see how human he is. I'm psyched this is getting a season 2. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ANIME!",5
mob-psycho-100,"Started with the comics by ONE and now its beautifully animated by Yoshimichi Kameda, IT'S ONE OF THE MOST VISUALLY AND STORY-WISE IMPRESSIVE ANIME'S SO FAR. It's amazing, just give it a try.The first thing that's great about this show is it's unique art style. ONE ditches the usual big eyed moe type characters for a more plain yet unique type. The show is jam packed with stunning visuals, complex characters and amazing and impactful moments to either pull at your heart strings or give you chills from excitement.",5
mob-psycho-100,"This show features an 8th grade kid, Mob, who has physic powers, making him different from other kids. He, however, doesn't flaunt these powers and use them to become a talk of others, instead he just goes to school normally and hopes to become popular through other means. He however, doesn't just use his powers for nothing, but does exorcisms of evil spirits along with his master, Reigen. In the show we watch Mob as he goes through all sorts of experiences dealing with evil spirits and other physics. He is an overpowered kid who lacks emotion, and once he gets into his emotions again, he becomes and unstoppable, epic monster. This show shows us a fun, thrilling, and funny story. Using a unique art style and characters we follow Mob as he strives for his goals along with the other character's goals as well.This show's main creative point is the counting system. Viewers watching this show watch Mob's emotions peak up as he goes through his situations. Once his count gets to 100, we get to experience his epic fights. This is the main reason why this is a must watch.",5
mob-psycho-100,"This anime is so friggin' good, I loved every single thing about it. I could praise the opening, the art design, the animation, the voice acting, the story, the humor, etc, but what I want to focus on is the message / ethos. It feels like every episode has something important and valuable to say. For instance, early on Mob is presented with a choice to join a club, and he ends up choosing a very surprising club, and while his decision was handled brilliantly and hilariously, there was more to it than just humor. The same thing goes for his scam-artist mentor Reigen, who is equally hilarious and insightful. In every episode, the anime presents the viewer competing perspectives on how to view oneself in relation to others, how to judge and value things, and frankly how to live. There are non-stop jokes and tremendous action, but the anime is not about jokes and action, it's more about philosophy, and I think it's very persuasive in making its points.",5
mob-psycho-100,"In case the review title wasn't enough to make you wanna watch this show, lemme enlighten you on why you need to watch Mob Psycho 100.The story and characters are exciting, funny and engaging as expected of ONE.The themes it tackles regarding growing up and youthful aspirations are all very identifiable.And most importantly, Studio BONES shines in their adaptation of the source material with animation and fight choreography so masterfully crafted that the Sakuga meter is pretty much shattered it's so good. And they based this all on ONE's artwork, which fans know is goofy doodle art (yet it still has its charm) so the fact that BONES was able to pull off such a monstrous feet goes to show how amazingly talented its animators are.Mob Psycho 100 is easily the best show of Summer 2016. Watch it.",5
mob-psycho-100,a very fun and entertaining anime to watch. if you liked opm youll like this. i thought the comedy on here was fantastic. i defo laughed a lot of times while watching this anime. the fight scenes were well done. their were some epic battles in this anime and youll definitely be blown away.some of the art was very detailed and that just made some moments even funnier and i appreciated thatthis anime is from the same creator of one punch man. i enjoyed opm and i also enjoyed mob psycho.overall id give this anime an 8/10. i recommend it if youre looking for something thats hilarious and has a lot of action.,5
mob-psycho-100,"My only complaints are that this series was rushed and ended so soon. You would think that Warner Japan would realize that audiences want a lot more of this by now. And yet One made it work as an overly puny, unforgivably under-funded mini-series again.Mob Psycho 100 holds my attention every second I'm watching it. It remains engaging and fun.The art style seems dated and an acquired taste to begin with, but the artists and animators make the visual aspects so painfully hilarious at times that I wouldn't have it any other way.Finally, I salute the Japanese voice actors who truly complete this anime by giving it their all.The story is just as off-the-wall and truly creative as you would expect from the creator of One Punch Man, but it stands up on its own against my criticism. Like any good anime that is this short, I'm pleading for more of it. But at least it ended gracefully. With a flourish, in fact.",5
mob-psycho-100,"My review for this anime Mob Psycho 100, would be 5/5. At first while i was watching the 1st few episodes of the anime, it felt boring, but over the few weeks & now, I feel that this anime is epicly, awesomely, & fantastic! You get pumped up when the Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideMC becomes raged,sad, or disorantated when he reaches 100%. But Mob Pyscho 100 is a fantastic anime. This anime is a must watch for people who likes to watch One Punch Man & watching supernatural esp, fighting anime!",5
mob-psycho-100,"I'm the type of person who gets drawn in by 1) the title of the show/book and 2) the imagery/art. If I didn't recognize this art as being similar to One Punch Man, I would probably not have given this show a chance unless someone recommended it to me. I'm kind of picky about art style, if it looks ""poorly"" drawn to me, I just skip it (TBH, I KNOW I'M SHALLOW). I'm so happy I saw this on the front page. This show definitely reminds me of OPM. The art (definitely in the eyes), and although the art style in this show is less detailed, the animation is still on point, and that really shows in some of the movement, and all of the fighting scenes. It's beautiful. The humor is still there as well. I'm definitely becoming a fan of ONE.",5
mob-psycho-100,"This is a very different Anime from One-punch Man. Those who have come to satisfy their ONE need for more may be left disappointed. This anime is a precursor to One-punch Man. You might see some similarities but all in all this is a completely different anime.You might also not like what the animation has to offer. Although it is in no way horrible it will take some getting used to. Murata is too busy to draw a manga version of this webcomic. The animation is still amazing. It's just very different, and very reminiscent of the actual webcomic this is adapted from.If you're still interested then strap in for this psychic-slice-of-life-detective-action-adventure. It is one hell of a ride.",5
mob-psycho-100,"From the creator of One Punch Man, you can expect some comic relief in this anime. As to say what does this anime entail? Well it's basically a story of a loner type kid with psychic powers and becomes more social due to psychic power drama (Haters/Enemies/Spirits, etc). Due to his emotional difficulty to express himself, that is the reason also of his power. The concept and all is pretty straight forward, the animation isn't beautiful as to sharp drawings, but to the fluid motion and colors of the animation. You become to enjoy it thru the first eps. I recommend to watch, it's enjoyable.",5
mob-psycho-100,"This series is really interesting. The art is top notch and very quirky but beautiful. It has quite its own charm. It is based on ONE's artwork, and although ONE is not the best artist, you can really see his unique style shine through here.I was a little confused at first about what kind of anime this was going to be but after seven episodes, I'm hooked. The protagonist, Kageyama Shigeo (MOB), is a very mature and complex character. He recognizes that he has immense psychic powers, but instead wants to focus on what he considers the important things in life, such as making friends and improving himself and finding meaning in life. He also doesn't believe in using his powers to harm other people and wishes to not rely on them.Each character and group is different and complex and plays their own role within the story. You can tell ONE is amazing at writing intricate, interesting and multidimensional stories. Not to mention very humourous.All in all, I'm having a great time with this show and I think anyone would enjoy it.",5
mob-psycho-100,"So, let's get this out of the way. I love the Mon Psycho 100 manga. It is easily one of my all time favorites. I also love ONE as an writer and artist. The OPM anime, for me, was subpar to the original webcomic, and it continues to drift from what made the original so great. Now, Bones is working on the Mob Psycho 100 anime. Despite it being insanely easy to rush a crappy animation as many studios do, Bones takes the time to animate all the imperfections in the original art style, something incredibly difficult to do. Take into account the use of acrylic paints in the ending animation, and you have one of the most incredible feats in animation in recent memory. There have been a lot of people who say things like ""the animations is crap"". This is not true. If you watch it and actually look, you will see the effort put into the amazing anime. Another complaint I see is the ""all the characters are 1-dimensional grabs from opm."" This is again not true. Although the characters start bland, they are designed to build up as the story progresses. Having read the manga before, I knew about the events that would transpire after the 4th episode and expected the great character development we see at that point. Most of my friends just enjoyed the basics of the show. The comedy, action, animation, as single bits and said the show was pretty good. But one friend kept complaining about the poorly developed characters and lack of motivation. When he got to episode 5, he was thoroughly impressed, as were all my other friends who said it was enjoyable, but not great. They are even more excited to see the continual growth of the characters that the manga holds for them. So, should you watch this show? Absolutely. It is ver much a story about growing up as well as an amazing comedy that shows the social satire of what would happen if espers walked the earth. Many people claim this is the weaker younger brother of OPM that just follows his big brothers footsteps. Although I agree it does take a lot from his big brother, it has had its time to take what big brother did wrong and improve where it was necessary. People who complain that OPM is better and MP100 has no original characters and/or poorly developed characters need to reevaluate OPM. The characters on that show are very 1-dimensional, but it works there. Here, we have well developed characters. If you have read this review and TRULY gave this show a chance, but you hate it because of the art style, the closest thing I can find to why someone wouldn't like this show, then I would kindly ask you to drag your preteen self back to the harem-ecchi section of crunchyroll. Is this a rant? Kinda. But just so you can get yourself a genuinely good review of someone who knows what they're talking about and to give those who actually liked the manga a way to blow off some steam by reading. Now go watch this.",5
mob-psycho-100,"UPDATENow that the show has completed, I am happy to say that Mob Psycho 100 is absolutely worth your time. The entire season has been filled with fun, creative, and amazing animation with fantastic art direction and excellent voice acting from the cast. Hey, Takahiro Sakurai is part of the main cast, there is no reason why you shouldn't watch this if not just to hear his sweet, sweet voice. Without a doubt in my mind, Mob Psycho 100 is the best show of the summer season and possibly the whole year. A great mix of comedy and drama with that classic ONE eccentricity, it's been a super fun ride that I will genuinely miss.I encourage you to watch Mob Psycho 100. If you can get past the show's art style and enjoy the creative efforts the staff has lovingly put into every episode, I assure you that you won't regret the experience.With that said, here's hoping for season two!In my opinion, yes.However, it's entirely up to you. The main complaint about Mob Psycho 100 is its art style. Many newcomers would expect the crisp, highly detailed character design and animation that was present in One Punch Man. While Bones could've completely went with designs and an art style similar to Yusuke Murata's, they didn't, creating a rather unconventional look. If Mob Psycho 100's art style is too big of a distraction for you to focus on the show's themes and story, don't watch it. Wait after a while, then watch it again. At that point, your tastes will change and you might want something like Mob Psycho. You may find the show unappealing and ""ugly"" visually, but give yourself some time and you could find yourself watching it in the future. While I highly support more ambitious and different art styles in anime, I'd rather not shove it down the throats of audiences who aren't ready for such a change.Putting Mob Psycho's art style aside, everything else genuinely lives up to the hype. Bones provides some of the best and uniquely animated sequences in Mob Psycho, making it possibly the best animated series of the year in my opinion. The opening and ending alone are a joy to watch. I can't really say someone who enjoyed One Punch Man would necessarily enjoy Mob Psycho. ONE's comedy is definitely there, but Mob Psycho focuses much more on heavier themes. There is more of a plot in Mob Psycho compared to the first season of One Punch Man, and from what I have read from the manga, the show is worth a watch.If I had to compare Mob Psycho 100 to another anime, it would be FLCL. In a way, Mob Psycho give a lot of FLCL vibes, placing a lot of emphasis figurative and literal character growth, a coming of age sort of story. Both have a similar atmosphere, only Mob Psycho is amped up to the maximum with its bizarre world of ghosts and psychics, with a colorful yet wacky cast. If you like FLCL, this one might peak your interest.A lot of people build up Mob Psycho 100 to be the best anime of the season, possibly the year, and I can agree. But, don't let the fact that it is another one of ONE's series influence your decision to watch it. I recommend watching at least the first two episodes, which build's up Mob Psycho 100's world, characters, and story fairly well. If it does not capture your interest right away, or the art style is too much for you to handle, give it another shot later on.",5
mob-psycho-100,"Similarities with One Punch Man?Sure.There is the comedy part, slightly recycled characters, similar overall theme and the awesome drawing style One has.But I think in terms of value and storytelling, this goes beyond One Punch Man, as well as many other new animes. I did not read the manga, I didn't even hear about Mob Psycho 100 until I went on Crunchyroll.This quickly became an instant favorite of mine.The artsyle is unique, the plot seems deep enough, but what I think is the golden star of this anime are the characters themselves.I'd describe this as a breath of fresh air, and I might even start the manga now.Watch!",5
mob-psycho-100,"Very interesting new adaptation of ONE webcomic/manga (which you may know for its One Punch Man). Mob Psycho 100 webcomic has a devoted fanbase, which is pretty impressive considering that contrary to One Punch Man, it hasn't been redrawn by a heavyweight and more experienced artist. While ONE is improving and his drawing aren't without charm, his art is clearly not what attracted this audience in the first place. This means that MP100 has been surviving on its story and its characters !Studio Bones has made the audacious choice of conserving the art style of ONE, this has freed them to get very deformed and expressive drawings and they manage to animate this with incredible fluidity and naturalness (or supernaturalness I guess) ! The result is surprisingly pleasant and attractive.Coupling this with ONE's strong points give rise to an anime that may well be a masterpiece. Be aware though that MP100 doesn't start as fast as OPM and that the first two episodes may lack the action that some of you are waiting for. They're not in any way bad but for those who came expecting action, I advise you look at episode 3 and upcoming episode 5 before dismissing this anime.Conclusion : Lot of potential, pretty funny, great characters, some interesting social commentary, awesome art and animation... Give it a try !",5
mob-psycho-100,"There are many similarities between the two shows but I'd really like to stress the point of dropping any and all expectations of this being like OPM. You're going to have to enjoy this show for what it is and not with the hopes that it'll be like OPM. This show is very slow and much more like a slice of life than the action packed comedy anime of OPM, I've read the manga so I know what to expect from it and so far I am really enjoying the anime adaptation of this but if you are going to be watching this because you enjoyed OPM and wanted something like it, this is not the show. Still though give the show a chance since the manga was phenomenal in my opinion and the show has pretty much went above all my expectations, just realize that this show doesn't follow the same sort of pacing and atmosphere of OPM and you'll probably enjoy it.",5
mob-psycho-100,"First off: if you're expecting anything like One Punch Man, leave immediately, because you will walk in with the wrong expectations and be unable to enjoy this work for what it is. I honestly wish this wasn't heavily advertised as being from the same creator, because they're vastly different works that cater to completely different audiences. But I digress. Mob Psycho 100, or simply mp100, can be loosely defined as the coming of age story of middle schooler Shigeo Kageyama, aka Mob. He's got a lot on his plate; crushing on a popular girl at school, having a much more talented younger brother, being used and underpaid by a greasy conman, being an esper. Stuff like that. During the course of the story, Mob will have to eventually confront all of these things, with sometimes comedic, sometimes heartbreaking results.There isn't anything quite like the experience you'll get enjoying this work. Few things have touched me in the strange way that mp100 has, and I hope that others will give this series a try.",5
mob-psycho-100,"I've read the manga and I do believe it is a masterpiece. It has the same crazy and blunt humor as One Punch Man, but with a lot more character development and emotional depth. The story is full of surprises and rarely adheres to overused tropes and every main character introduced is likeable and complex. Also, Mob is one of the most likeable protagonists I have seen in manga. I recommend all of you to read!As for the first episode, I see the anime adapters have added some flashy extra scenes to make the first ep open with a bang. (They also added a sappy backstory to the tunnel spirit for some reason but whatever.) That's fine as long as they stick closely to the manga for the rest of the episodes. I just hope they don't omit anything important.The OP is what really blew me away in this ep! Fantastic and incredible fluid animation, very creative and trippy transitions, and lots of foreshadowing and symbolism Love it!From what we've seen in this first ep and the PVs this anime is sure to be a visual work of art with stunning animation! Glad Studio BONES is at the helm, you can't go wrong.",5
mob-psycho-100,"I can't get across why Mob Psycho 100 is my favorite anime of all time. Every time I think I've found something that beats it and I look back at any clip from MP100, I realize what a fool I was to think that anything can top this for me. The character development. The themes. The animation used to portray the story. The dynamics between characters. The humor. The action. The plot. The music. Beautiful. I'm often overwhelmed by how much I love this anime.",5
mob-psycho-100,"I'm so glad they made a second season of this. It was so much fun to see Mob grow and the relationships change, whether it was Mob coming into his own a little with Reigen or beginning to fix the nagging fear between himself and Ritsu. This is such a fun, genuine show of ridiculousness and genuine sincerity. I hope there's a third season, but will be pleased with the reasonable conclusion if two is all we end up receiving.",5
mob-psycho-100,"There isn't much to say that hasn't already been said - or that this show doesn't show on its own. There's no way to describe the beautiful showcase of animation, storytelling, and comedy in a way that does it justice. Power scaling is super fun, as are the ways they make that power scaling cower in comparison to the ideals of being a good person. There is a truly passionate team behind this, and I hope they get to do what they want like this more often.",5
overlord,"I remember when this show first came out a few seasons back.  It was unfortunate that it came out in an off season when people were already burnt out on the MMORPG genera of anime due to shows like SAO and Log Horizon.  I also seem to remember that Overlord was not licensed for simulcast by any major companies so it was difficult for people to watch during the season that it aired (I believe Funimation picked it up after the season ended.) Ultimately, these circumstances turned Overlord into an underrated gem.  Overlord takes the strategy aspects and world building of Log Horizon and then asks the question, what would happen if the non-human ""bad guy"" races were sucked into an MMO?  Unlike SAO or Log Horizon, Overlord has a relatively small cast of characters and while the main character, Ainz Ooal Gown is in essence a power fantasy character, he is still immensely entertaining to watch. One of the key elements of this show is a sort of satire on the power fantasy character.    The show asks some fairly new questions and introduces some new concepts as well.  For instance, Ainz Ooal Gown's avatar is an undead lich; as a result, the show explores how his psychology would change if he actually became an evil undead monster. Some may be turned off by the lower budget animation and the slower pace of the story. However, if you can endure the first few episodes of exposition and setup, the story starts to move forward with a fairly stead pace from there.  Unfortunately, overlord is not a very long show; though its conclusion is decent, it certainly leaves open the possibility of a sequel.  If you enjoyed the strategic aspects of Log Horizon and don't mind the rather average animation for this show, then you will surely enjoy the adventures of Ainz Ooal Gown and his NPCs of Nazarick.",4.5
overlord,"So after Crunchyroll and Funimation high fived I have been waiting for Overlord to show up on here. Its a premise we all know, guy gets teleported to a world he is/isn't familiar with (MMORPG) and has to find a way to cope with the confusion that is laid out in front of him. Ainz Ooal Gown (Momonga) the main character quickly understands what has happen and doesn't harp on the ""omg what happened"" and ""how do I get back"". He makes sure everyone is safe and strategically plans out Nazarick's future plans of dominance, while being a thoughtful and BAMF evil overlord to any who lay in his wake.Ok as you can tell I love this show and have watched it multiple times. I will say the last few episodes definitely leave you wanting more. But if you enjoy stories of fantasy/person lost in a new world, I'm sure you will enjoy this. +Story+Characters (Albedo!)+Art+Overpowered MC (if you like that)-Ending (Could have ended stronger, but here's to season 2)",4
overlord,"Happy Crunchyroll got this.Overlord is one of my favorite series of all time (I also buy the light novels).It is another one of those trapped in a game series, but the main character actually goes from in the game, to a real fantasy world, so i hope that's not a turn off for some people. The main character's, .....well character is also an evil-type being, so he needs to act accordingly. I'll keep this short so here's pros and cons.Pros:-Awesome world-Awesome characters (especially the main character)-good fights and story-some tactics and planning (if that's your thing)Cons:-a bit slow in the middle episodes (try and tough through it)-speeds through some thingsI hope you like this series as much as I do. If you do, please try reading the novels, they're even better than the anime. Get ready for season 2!",5
overlord,"[EDIT FOR SEASON 3] More of Ains in the show but still underwhelming. The characters do carry this story arc. Some actions feel goofy and Ains really looks like he's just being led by the nose by Demiurgus. This makes him look incompetent to me, though he still looks like an omniscient god to the NPCs. To be overlord you just overrule every once in a while. There are many things he should have done differently to remain in control. The lunatics are running the asylum by the end of the season.[EDIT FOR SEASON 2] Season 2 shifts focus away from the main character, rather jarringly so. If you expect a consistent flow from where season one left off, you won't get it. The story pacing slows way down, and zooms in focus on two of the NPCs. It does give the feeling the NPCs of Nazzarik have really become alive, so the show is still good. I certainly can't take off any stars. But please remember I am rating it against other anime, not verses season 1.  To me, season 2 is not as good as season one. The NPC characters, while cool, do still feel like dolls. The way their individual challenges are told is dry. Sebas Tian arc for example makes tropes it's mainstay. The pacing is excruciatingly slow. You know what the outcome will be, heck Ains even foreshadows the finale in a short speech and a closing scene.   To iterate, the pacing is slow, we miss the guild leader, dry characters, predictable outcomes, and trope setups. So why watch? The action is good, even if sparse. The imagery is perfect, and some of the villains are truly evil so their inevitable demise is satisfying. The story is about overpowered MC, villains being defeated shouldn't be a spoiler. But episode one sets up a grand battle which we won't get, not in 3 episodes. I hope this is a double-decker season, the pacing would fit, but it's been fun even if it teases more than delivers. Still better than most of what we get. Still 5/5 stars.[BELLOW IS SEASON ONE'S REVIEW] This is a ""game world becomes real"" style anime. Not an original idea but definitely best executed. Unlike SAO the character of the player trapped is top level and owner of top guild on the server. He stays logged in until the supposed time the servers are to go off line for the last time. As the clock hits 0:00:00 the world becomes real and he is trapped in it. That's when his adventure truly begins.The animation is top notch and the use of CGI is limited to where it makes sense to use CGI. I think only one scene in 13 episodes has CGI. The voice actors are nominees for numerous awards and the music is enjoyable. The story is good but the project calls for a double-decker season or at least there should have been season 2 in the works, season 1 is the prelude and the real baddies are not reviled until the last episode. That made the MC  seem overpowered.[EDIT] Expect update after end of season 2. So far so good.",5
overlord,"The first 13 episodes of this anime are incredible. Great production value and story all around. From the animation and action to the music to the actually-unique characters to the pacing and plot, this show is definitely worth a look if you are a fan of fantasy and/or the ""stuck in a VRMMO"" trope, without that trope getting too heavy handed. Unlike shows like SAO or .hack//, Overlord focuses more on a max-level player whose first concern is NOT merely logging out again when he realizes he's trapped in the game.But make no mistake, Momonga/Ainz is NOT a hero in any sense. He is a cold, calculating, and brutal antihero, influenced in no small part by whim. How much of that is actually his personality and how much of that is part of the emotional response control mechanism introduced in the first episode, I don't know. It can be an interesting journey to follow his psychology, but don't get attached to any of the other characters in this show. Having read through volume 7 of the LN before I couldn't take anymore, I'll just say the emotional pattern established in this first anime season is repeated more than once, even as the story gets much more interesting and complex. Think Game of Thrones.That said, there is plenty of humor and dark humor in this series to help keep it somewhat lighter in tone. If you are one of those who can cast away your empathy, or if you're a fan of punishment, you'll love this series in its entirety, but nearly every shonen anime fan will enjoy this first season. So absolutely watch it and appreciate it for what it is, but gird your loins if you look beyond the veil.",5
overlord,"So, I was one of the very first people to review this series when it landed on Funimation, I remember it was sooo underrated when it aired in 2015 and I was worried none would see it. But, despite everything this series has grown and maintained its fanbase beautifully which should attest to how great this series is. I am excited a second season is coming, because this is one of the few legendary series that needs, hell 4 seasons in my opinion. All hail Ains Ooal Gown, The Supreme Ruler of The Great Tomb of Nazerick!With joking aside for a moment lol, this is one of the few series that made me review them and actually read the light novel after. I am waiting on Overlord volume 12 to release like everybody else caught up to the Light Novel, which is even better than the anime by a long shot, but I still love seeing it animated. Even if I know how it will turn out, that's how wonderful of gift show this is.PS. This is my first review on Crunchy, even though I have been lurking on this site since 2014, I am a 3rd gen anime fan. Watching anime since the early 1990sOriginal Funimation review under the same username Animegeek777I went into this anime blind, and by the first two episodes I was insanely immersed and hooked on this show. By episode 8, I started to read the light novel, which is just amazing. This series is truly a masterpiece, and closely follows its source.",5
overlord,"I've seen people leave negative reviews saying that OP characters make the fights ""boring and predictable"".  Let me just say that this is not a Shonen 1v1 fighting anime, and if that's the only thing you look for in an anime you wouldn't be able to understand Overlord's appeal.   With the exception of maybe 2 fights, the majority of the confrontations in this series are not balanced 1v1 fights at all, they are massacres.  This anime starts out as a typical Isekai with the exception that the MC accepts his fate and proceeds to gather information to conquer the new world around him.  In a way the show has a sort of Code Geass appeal which to me was not the mecha fights, but Lelouch's strategy and conquest.  Also, the outcomes for most of the fights are indeed predictable, but only because you know who is going to WIN.  Most of the enjoyment from confrontations with the MCs comes from not knowing who is going to LOSE.  I found myself for most of the show hoping that a few of my favorite side characters would not find themselves ""in the wrong place at the wrong time"" and end up being massacred by the MCs.  That's the main thrill of this anime for me along with incredible world building.  Also, watching some villains have their egos crushed by overpowered monsters is also a guilty pleasure this show offers. I'm going to drop a quote from one of my favorite series, Fargo,  that sums up Ainz in a nutshell.""I've always believed a new king should start his reign with an act of kindness and an act of cruelty. That way, your subjects know that you're capable of both - God and monster.""Yes the real thrill of the show is whether the Great Skelly will choose mercy or cruelty and wondering if there is anyone out there who can stop him.",5
overlord,"Let me start this off by saying 'if you watch Overlord for the fights, and want it to be a standard shonen show, you are watching it wrong'.Overlord isn't about doing battle, or being an overpowered isekai protagonist, its about political maneuvering.  if you liked Code Geass for Lelouch's evil plots instead of the Mecha-battles, you are on the right page. Ainz is an OP demon Overlord, surrounded by equally evil OP people who is trying to take over the world, not by force, but by cunning plans. He has no idea if his underlings will remain forever loyal to him, hence his posturing as the big bad evil they all see him as. He has no idea what world he is in, and whether or not there are people as powerful, or more powerful than him, hence his crude planning. and finally, he is an undead, in both body and mind, as evidenced by his body seeing his own emotions as negative status effects, hence his amorality. He literally cannot care.he isn't flat out evil, he just doesn't care. This is the Game of Thrones of Isekai's, the Breaking Bad, the show that shows you the hero as a villain. This is Thanos in Avengers, and its awesome.",5
overlord,"I'll preface this by saying that this review is being posted as of Overlord 3, episode 4.Back in, I think the early 2000's, the first anime that I can think of that threw characters into a giant virtual reality world was the .hack series. That was the introduction to a video game being the core focus of the plot of an anime. Fast-forward to 2012 and, you guessed it, Sword Art Online was released, throwing VR anime into the mainstream in a sense. If you've ever watched anime, you know about SAO, whether you love it or hate it, I believe it helped bring VR anime to the forefront of anime in general, and introduced the concept of a relatively OP main character without a lot of focus on how he developed his skills, just kinda made them that way.Now advance to 2015 and Overlord season one was introduced. .hack introduced, SAO made it main stream, but Overlord, Overlord perfected the formula. Overlord threw caution to the wind and said ""f*ck it, we're not gonna make him super strong but eventually find his equal in power, we're gonna make him untouchable out the gate and just see where it goes"" (yes I know it's based on a light novel, that was probably the thought process of the author as well). Obviously it's a little more in-depth than that, but you get the gist. Now, besides the OP main character, literally all of the characters he associates himself with are also on a completely different level. Honestly, I'd argue that any single one of the floor guardians, or even the battle maids, could take over the world single-handedly, or at least put up a fighting chance. Now all this power is all well and good right? Right, however, rather than rely on his over-whelming power to take over the world (with the underlying main goal of finding people in the game the world used to be), he uses careful and meticulous planning and manipulation to achieve his goals. This show literally subscribes to the theory that rather than rely on your power, use it as a last resort if nothing else works, and I think that's what makes the show so great. Instead of just running around killing everyone, which occasionally does happen, which would get boring fast to be honest, as much as we all like it, the show builds up anticipation for a massive fight that it so one-sided it'd be better to call a massacre. The build-up and anticipation, albeit painful at times, is what is necessary to this show being so great. Another strong point the show literally milks the living hell out of is dramatic irony. We, as the viewer, know everything that's going on, so it makes it all the more satisfying to see conceited, self-absorbed characters put in their place by the Tomb of Nazarick characters, regardless of how it's done. I won'r spoil anything, but it happens often, and unlike characters destroying other characters on a regular basis, seeing people put in their place is always satisfying. I can't say anymore because I feel like it could spoil more, but you'll see what I mean when you watch the show.This wouldn't be a review if I didn't point out where I think the show falls short in my opinion. There are some arcs in the anime that are honestly not too entertaining, but that was only the lizardman arc, and when I say not too entertaining, it was still very solid. There were also episodes in the better arcs that were also not too good either. The pacing of the show is also relatively slow, which sucks sometimes because you always wanna see a fight every episode, but as I stated earlier, that wouldn't be good for the show in general. I think the animation style is very good, however, if you compare it to some of the stuff you see in the LN, it falls short. I think the anime would be even more popular if there was some more detail put into the animation style, but I feel it's already a bit late for that, and if it were changed, it may cause an up-roar among the devout fans.All in all, this is an incredible piece of work that has the potential to influence how fantasy, video game, OP, and even strategy based anime are made. Even now you can see how it's influenced studios to make more OP character in isekai anime (however they fall a lot more short of Overlord...yes I'm looking at you ""In Another World with My Smartphone). I'd highly recommend this show to new and experienced anime viewers.P.S. The soundtrack is phenomenal and I usually skip the intros and outros, but I always listen to Overlord's.",5
overlord,"First off read the light novels, they are extremely good and have tons more information then the anime because of the 13 episode restraint. Overlord is the best Evil MC Isekai their is out there. It actually focuses on the whole world and builds many characters from outside Nazarick.Its great that it doesn't always follow the MC. The new world has shown how weak and fragile it has become yet it has taken down many strong players in the past that were revered as gods.Even the lizardman arc which is heavily criticized is extremely important. A whole species is fighting for survival against Nazaricks weakest army that just RANDOMLY generates around the Tomb. Ainz wanted to develop Cocytus as a commander. Adamantite warriors are known as living legends of the human world but they become fodderized by middle tier characters in Nazarick.Season 3 is starting a little slow but to the light novel readers know whats coming. Listen to the dialogue and ask yourself why is this important to show you. The reason is it will build up a lot of action scenes later. The world props the overlord up even higher then 100% MC pov like most Isekai.I am happy to elaborate into more detail about Overlord but I don't want to spoil everything. Theirs a lot more occuring then you think like Demiurge farming Humans for skin to make scrolls.",5
overlord,"when i think fantasy, i think magic. it is usually the most enthralling aspect of any good fantasy show. and whats the most entertaining thing one could do with magic? well, have intense magical battles with it of course! so why do we so rarely get to see that? I'll tell you why, because the protagonist wielding the magic is always some sissy soy boy, busy ""learning"", ""growing"", and doing the ""right thing"". well not our main man Ianz here. This man has more testosterone running through him than a transgender pro wrestler. he will hand out fireballs and lightning like Oprah handing out cars. thats right, he's the villain, and the main character. and not a kinda sorta villain with a complicated backstory, but all out mustache-twirling goodness. somehow they have managed to turn one of the most annoying tropes in anime into one of the most perfect plot devices for delivering some serious beat-downs i have ever seen. now, i like deep characters and enlightening journeys as much as the next guy, but sometimes a man just needs to watch somebody get blasted in the face with some painful looking magic, and that urge has never been sated better than in overlord. remember your first skyrim rampage? well this is skyrim rampage the anime. If i could sum it up in once sentence, imagine if one punch man was a villain. sure, there isnt much dramatic tension just about ever, but that's not the point. the show does try to invest you a little in it's side characters, and i must say it fails pretty hard. but it's all worth it once Ianz and his friends come on screen. their near-limitless magical powers provide for the most creative and satisfying destruction in all of the fantasy genre. as soon as i watched overlord, it had earned its place on my top series of all time, and is now my favorite fantasy anime. though technically it isn't a fantasy anime, as its one of those ""stuck in a game"" anime, it basically is fantasy. you will be forgetting about the game aspect almost immediately. Now, if you are the type who does need a bit of depth to your characters, the show has you covered, just not so much in season 1. while Ianz stays just how we like him, his followers do start to show their more human sides in later episodes. the show begins to feel a bit more like the works of one punch man, avatar, and mob psycho 100, in that it's more about the nature of power and what to do with it than the actual power. It is very refreshing to see this idea from a different perspective, that of traditionally ""bad"" people, as it is really the first time it has been done right. while it doesn't last long, the story arc focusing on sebas, one of Ianz's followers, explores this concept beautifully while never leaving you without some quality action for too long. I haven't been this entertained watching an anime in a long time. I anxiously wait to see if we will get a season 4.P.S. i just had to link this video, its perfect for this show:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcbazH6aE2g",5
overlord,"I've seen the first season and 1/2 of the second season of SAO; the series had a decent level of humor and solemnity. However, that actually changed when a YouTube recommendation introduced me to Overlord, the rising anime of 2018. Overlord had a great atmosphere of suspense and amount of knowledge on how a real fantasy MMORPG works. While SAO and Overlord are both on par with humor and solemnity, they do have a slight difference in storytelling and settings:#1 – Characters and Storytelling:SAO ends with Kirito achieving his main goal of surviving the Sword Art Online game, now free from being dead, and later goes to Alfheim Online to save Asuna, he saves her, and the adventure continues on with newer characters, but with no other real purpose. The characters where decent enough, but not as much as the abridged version of the series everyone knows and loves watching to this day. Characters in SAO Abridged were given hilariously unique traits not visible in the real series; for example, the abridged Kirito and Asuna were augmented to act more like a comedic duo of sociopaths; honestly, SAO abridged is the sort of anime I would watch.Overlord, on the other hand, has a better understanding of the titular character Momonga/Ainz Ooal Gown--his goal, personality, and style. He possessed the same goal as Kirito (free himself and find out what went wrong with the game), but also wishes to remain in the Yggdrasil game to lead his guild, Ainz Ooal Gown (Nine’s Own Goal). As he grows into a more competent and focused leader, he develops a strong sense of compassion and loyalty to his guildmates unlike Kirito, who cares but not so much about others. Overlord also went further into telling the story of different characters through their perspective.#2 – Setting:While SAO had a fascinating combination of science and fantasy traits, the story didn’t grant the characters a full gamer autonomy in playing a race of their choosing (categories of elves and sprites were the only ones they could play as in Alfheim Online). Overlord gave the player the ability to play any race (Elder lich, slime, succubus, vampire, beastman, etc.) and create their own NPCs. SAO was more of a science fiction world than a real fantasy, whereas Overlord was genuine fantasy containing references of Norse mythology.This is my take on Overlord. The series was well-paced in storytelling, had a greater understanding of the plot, the fantasy setting was grand, and had better characters of unique style than SAO.Sources:The Genius of Sword Art Online (Abridged): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46jzSn9SLlgAinz Ooal Gown – Overlord Wiki: https://overlordmaruyama.wikia.com/wiki/Ainz_Ooal_Gown",4.5
overlord,"Plot: 10/10. Has a good steady pace around episode 3 on.Characters: 12/10 (What can I say? Albedo is bae)Art: 9/10. Animation is the best out there, but I'll be damned if the details are almost spot-on to the novels.The character development of the main character, Ainz Ooal Gown (Momonga) from ""I'm a human playing an evil undead lich"" to ""I am an evil undead lich"" was seamless. He doesn't focus on getting back to the ""real world"" or how he got there, only making sure Nazarick and its inhabitants are safe. There are side stories that don't take away from the main story, but instead expand on the world and lets you get invested in not just the main characters, but some side ones as well.And honestly, I'm all for OP characters in this type of anime so long as they're done right. I just wish there were more episodes to binge watch already",4.5
overlord,"Overlord is a great anime. If you enjoy world building and character development, with some pretty awesome fights thrown in, this is the anime for you. Even so, do not expect nonstop action like other anime.Also, read the LNs. seriously. I have never bothered with light novels, and I only read the mangas of animes that I watch if I really like them. However, with this one, I liked it so much that I started reading the manga... and that added a lot more to the story. I liked THAT so much that I went and started reading the LNs. I was not disappointed. There is SO MUCH more you get from the LNs that I would highly recommend it to anyone who even remotely likes the anime. You will not be disappointed. I bought all the versions in English, and read the rest from free translations online. 10/10 will read again",5
overlord,"Why does it have to be over 250 chapters long just to submit a review. I just thought this series was cool as hell and I'd recommend to all of my friends. Which I would, if I had any. I guess this is where I can tell you a bit more about myself. I am a programmer student that live is Sweden where I attend at the KTH university. I was addicted to the video game League Of Legends. I had played it for over 5 years before I decided to get myself banned on order to stop playing the game. I made it to diamond 2 as a support Thresh/Rakan main on the EUW server. Getting myself  purposely banned from that shit was the best thing I've ever done. If you're in a similar situation I suggest you do the same. Just be toxic until you get banned or message RIOT  and ask to get your account removed. Ohh well, Idk if you can respond to reviews, but if you can pls submit other series that are similar to this one to me. Much love!",5

Hey! Don't judge me!",5
overlord,"This is the perfect show for anyone who loves a Mc with power beyond anyone else. This show has a similar plot as many other shows but this shows executes every single scene perfectly.

I would Recommend this show to anyone who wants to watch a very entertaining and funny show",5
overlord,"At first this anime seems to be the typical MMO Driven Anime, however, as seasons progress you begin the realize the ingenious mind of Kugane Maruyama.   The attention to detail of different character personalities does not disappoint. You'll find even the character development of characters doomed to die will catch you off guard when they actually die.   Kugane Maruyama will lead you on an adventure towards climatic scenarios that you want to see so desperately bad, and then he will give you the climatic resolve you so so desired in an orgasmic outcome of pleasure and the need for more.   The surprising Originality of the anime, despite being a MMO-Style Anime is very pleasing. I get so involved into the world that I almost forget entirely that the MC is a MMO player.   Adding to the Originality you'll also watch as the path of the MC Slowly takes him down a Dark Path leaving his humanity behind him. Highly Recommend this Action Packed Anime",5
overlord,"So, there's a trend lately of anime with ridiculously OP characters that don't take themselves too seriously, and this is most certainly an example of that.  So, if that doesn't appeal to you, this show won't either.  At first, this looks like this will be an SAO-style anime, but once the protagonist encounters enemies in this world, it's obvious he outclasses them on every level.  Momonga is a max level rpg character and guild leader who gets transported to a real fantasy world, along with his guild hall and all his npc minions (who also greatly outclass all enemies encountered thus far).  On top of all that, he's also very intelligent and doesn't take risks (although he easily could afford to).  So, in terms of power level, it's like ""What if Light Yagami (from Death Note) was One Punch Man, and what if he also had an army of One Punch Men with which to punch men once?""If you're looking for a fun power trip, a silly comedy, or an epic (albeit relatively low-stakes for the protagonist) fantasy adventure, this checks all those boxes nicely.One final note, the Opening and Closing theme songs from artists ""OxT"" and ""Myth & Roid"" have been consistently top notch for all three seasons thus far.",5
overlord,"Of all shows in this genre, Overlord is without doubt the best crafted alongside Log Horizon. The characters are well developed, and have more depth than the majority of the anime in this genre which sometimes feel more surface level. There's a healthy amount of fan service if you're interested in that, but if that's something that can put you off of a show - it's not a focus in more than the first 2 episodes of season one. The first two episodes are likely designed this way as a hook for the incel crowd and dialed down in comparison to some anime that is floating around on Crunchyroll. Definitely worth giving it a shot, stop if you don't like it after episode 4 or 5. 10/10 A+ top kek",5
overlord,"I slept on this anime for so long, then I decided to add it to my queue but kept skipping it didn't seem interesting (even though it had good reviews). Finally decided to watch Episode 1 and WOW amazing. For a few minutes I though it was going to be another anime where he is trapped in a game, someone who is weak, scare, doesn't want to hurt no one (especially humans), but NOPE I was completely wrong. Anyways don't skip this anime is entertaining, funny, exciting, and the art is superb. Finish it in 2 days.",5
overlord,"We're all familiar with the genre of being pulled into a video game world. However, this is a fresh take on it. In this series, the protagonist finds his game world turning real. However unlike other series where a good guy gets trapped in a new world, this guy was the leader of a guild of bad guys - the monster types, who thwarted adventurers. So for this series, the goal isn't really about escape. It's about dominating the new world. He's not an evil person, but at the same time he doesn't care about breaking a few eggs to get what he wants. He has no problem crushing anyone that gets in the way of his plans. And it's fantastic. I am a latecomer to this series, but I burned through all of season 1 and got caught up on season 2 in record time, because the entertainment factor is really high.",5
overlord,"I absolutely loved season 1 of Overlord, as it puts the tired genre of ""stuck in an MMO"" on it's head. Originally, I found Overlord on Funimation a couple years back. Although my friend recommended against me watching it, I was way too intrigued by the thumbnail given to the series. I am honestly ecstatic that I went through with it in the end, as it is by and far my favorite anime of all time now. This is the first anime that actually got me to go through and read its original source material in the LNs. Every character is masterfully crafted in my opinion, and the few times that explanations are not specifically used (such as the case with Albedo's race), they are covered just as beautifully created and explained in said Light Novels. Although the anime did an amazing job with the adaption, I would highly recommend the LN because it gives more of a complete picture of how they were all crafted.So for TL;DR purposes: If you have not watched this anime yet, you are denying yourself from seeing some truly amazing work. For newbies to the series: give the series a shot. For newbies and veterans alike: read the LNs as well if you want the complete experiences.I for one cannot wait for season 2 to drop within the next couple weeks!",5
overlord,"Overlord is what you would expect from an MMORPG based story. Main character somehow ends up in the game after something goes wrong and thus uses his/her gaming knowledge to overcome obstacles and threats through the story. Overlord is just like that, however it is the way this is presented that makes the story interesting from start to finish.The main character, Momonga (Ainz Ooal Gown) finds himself stuck in an MMORPG called Yggdrasil after the servers are shut down for good while he is still logged in. However the world he is now stuck inside becomes more realistic than just a game. Taking on the physical persona of his in-game avatar, Momonga's story throughout the series revolves around exploring the world of Yggdrasil alongside his companions who were simple NPC's in the game but have now acquired personalities of their own. The story-telling is quite balanced. You never feel like you're out of the loop throughout the story, nor are you left with a sense of boredom due to things moving slow. The main selling point of this anime are the characters, more specifically the dynamic between Momonga and one of his minions, Albedo who was originally just an NPC character that inhabited the guild hall of the game prior to the server shut down. Now I know what you're thinking. How is this any different than Log Horizon or Sword Art Online? Well while it does have similarities to other anime/manga that delve into the world of protagonist in a virtual setting, it differs in the fact that instead of other players, the world of Yggdrasil is inhabited by former NPC's now with their own personalities. It is definitely worth a watch if you enjoy the type of 'stuck in a video-game world' setting. The story, the characters, the music and the atmosphere are exceptional and are sure to draw you in.  If you find yourself in need of something to watch, I highly suggest Overlord especially now that it has been confirmed that Overlord will be getting a second season in the future!",4.5
overlord,"How do you review a nearly perfect show, what could I possibly say that would be worth reading? This show is incredible. It perfectly balances telling a story about the main character and his minions in a way where they aren't simply minor characters that you will forget off screen. It shows the motivations of all the ancillary characters and what drives them very well without making them seem like throw away characters used simply to advance a plot. This show is one of those shows that gets a repeated viewing from me when I watch a new show that turns out to be a dud which happens far more frequently since there is just so much damn anime these days. Watch this show, then watch it again to see all the little things you may have missed.",4.5
overlord,"Are you sick an tired of trapped in an MMORPG anime? Me too. Quire sadly it has taken over almost the entirety of fantasy anime, meaning that getting some normal fantasy anime is very rare. All the game talk and level systems get in the way of the story. Overlord does a great job of breaking that scheme. Sure, the series starts with the main character being trapped in a game, but it evolves in such a way that it steps away from that flat, overused and abused narrative to lean more and more on the fantasy elements. The show also gives a great perspective by playing from the main antagonist's perspective, rather than the heroes. Very enjoyable and highly recommended. I do hope however that we get some true fantasy anime back into the mind of producers.",5
overlord,"This anime started off slow for me. The hook missed its mark during the first episode and I contemplated on whether I should continue with Overlord.I'm glad I decided to watch the second episode as from there on, the hook was cast deep and I became quite interested in knowing what Lord Ains will be doing next to further his ambitions in the new world.Fantastic series, I powered through the three seasons in three days. I'm reading that a fourth season is due to come out somewhat soon so i'm excited.All hail Sorcerer King Ains Ooal Gown!",5
overlord,"Today, the isekai is considered stale, and people have not been enjoying it as much ever since Sword Art Online came out. I, personally, am a fan of isekais, but I can see why people think that they are getting old.At the beginning, you might think to yourself that Overlord is just a generic isekai with an insanely overpowered main character. He gets stuck in a game as the character he was playing, is a mage, and is incredibly overpowered.As the show goes on, however, there is a lot of character development and the plot gets really intense. The first season focuses mostly on Ains, but the second and third focus more on the side characters.This anime is by far one of my favorites and will most likely stay that way for a long time to come.",5
overlord,"Now I just spat some straight facts up there, along with a few head turns, but don't worry I have the words and descriptions for you.So here's a good synopsis from the isekai connoisseur as myself:An average man with ties to his past guild is transported to a new world, along with his guild base. This new world is home to several characters with their own interests and goals, however one day this newly transported boi comes and creates some problems and solves said problems with his own spin on it.This anime focuses not only on a level 100 World-class ""god"" but the inhabitants of this new world. And that right there is the selling point. Its not the villainous deeds the protagonist commits. Its the characters and how they all blend nicely together to make a believable fantasy world, especially since the camera leads you off the main character and sometimes he won't be present for whole episodes. The idea of a man with nigh unlimited power coming to ruin it all is a fun prospect, however the story should mostly be about the development of the world and how it is built upon by those around it. This is my favorite anime by far and I would love if other people saw it my way.Here let me tell you a story. I was like most folk out there, young, naive, a real stickler for a certain taste of anime. However one day a friend brought this up to me. Now I ignored it as one should to a regular RPG anime, but after some consideration and thought, I checked it out. By golly this anime rocked me like no other. It hits up on all the best parts a story should. It tells a great protagonist with realistic flaws and ambitions. It builds the world where everything is concise and nothing is rule-breaking, especially since this is meant to be a game. Characters flow through the world as each one is unique and any could be a favorite. If you considered this anime even a little. I whole heartily implore you, please check it out. The first episode won't be enough to real you in, but its a start, and before you know it you may be up at 3 A.M. wondering how you got here with a smile on your face.",5
overlord,"This series had the potential to be an absolute masterpiece. The world building that Maruyama wrote into his tail is expansive. The plot is fresh, and has you pondering the validity of might makes right. But, the studio that makes it always starts with some decent animation, but very quickly everything deteriorates into pan still shots. The CGI is atrocious, especially in season 3. It is depressing that the studio making this show pours so little love into it, but I still enjoyed it.",5
overlord,"When this show first came out I didn't know what to think of it and didn't give it a try. Then the second season showed up, and I didn't even notice. But because of the trailers and reviews of the show before, during, and after the third season, I then decided to give it a try. After three days, I finished the all the seasons, and after watching from start to finish all I can think is... WHY HAVEN'T I SEEN THIS SOONER!!! Man I was an idiot for ignoring this show because it was amazing. The fights were great, and the story kept me on the edge of my seat. And I mean that literally, I almost fell. It was so funny at some scenes, and the story kept you wanting to see more of the world and characters. If I could think of one word to describe this show, it would be magnificent!",5
overlord,"In my opinion, the best fantasy anime out there! Of course it has its downsides with little action from time to time and madness mixed into the whole thing. But that is what makes it so good! This isn't a normal fantasy anime where the person is super powerful, well he is but he has also lost his connection to his humanity, meaning that he has gone straight down the villain hole. You're basically watching a show from the evil demon lord's perspective! Of course, he still has some connections where he does some things out of habit but then he has no idea why. You're basically following the making of an absolute evil!",5
overlord,"Overlord has quickly become one of my favorite series to watch, with an interesting and diverse cast of characters that are all extremely intriguing in their own right, coupled with a story that can pull you in with its many twists and turns, especially the stuff that you don't really get an explanation for. Overlord lets you see a small part in a much grander scale, and doesn't try to explain everything to the audience through dunce characters, which is one of my favorite things about the show. it can be slow in places, especially around the lizardman arc, and it sometimes suffers in terms of animation, but it is very much worth watching, and i will always recomend it.",5
overlord,"I love this anime, I really do, but its CGI battles really left me feeling a little bit down. It kinda feels like they cut some corners there. The animation is super smooth, the story is very interesting but when the CGI effects come in it kinda feels forced. This latest season really drove it home though. The CGI goblins, battles, and creatures were very difficult to watch, which is a let down because the story is getting good. But I would still recommend that you watch it for yourself and not just take my word for it. I mean what do I know I'm just a guy on the Internet.",5
overlord,"I'll start by saying this:Season 3 did a great job with the characters and the over arcing story, because of these qualities I will definitely return for the next season.However if this were any other show I would have given up do to the over use of CGI and underwhelming ridiculous CGI fights. Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideBattles like the Goblins vs the Humans looked so ridiculous that it completely took away any emotional weight that episode had. You can also see this in the final battle of the show, the baby goats were meant to be terrifying, but to see the terribly animated CGI monsters stomp through a crowd of faceless CGI lookalikes is completely ridiculous and betrays the horror that the scene was trying to impart. If next season is like this then I'm afraid I'm going to have to drop this show and read the light novels/manga.",5
overlord,"Overlord is what I would call a special type of guilty pleasure, it may seem just like another power fantasy, but it is more than that.What Overlord does right that many others like it don't, in my opinion would be it's setup and that our protagonist for all intents and purposes is the villain. The power fantasy that is Overlord is one that strikes fear into adventures, heroes, entire races, you name it. The satisfaction of seeing the good guys work up plans and actions to then be torn down by our ""hero"" just seems to work surprisingly well. Of course though the villain needs to be good, and Ains Ooal Gown manages to be that perfect embodiment of a power fantasy, he is respectable and always willing to give his opponent the chance. Only to then strike them down disgustingly fast when his generosity is overlooked. His servants also manage to bring their own intimidation when out on the field, spreading the will of their supreme one. Top it all off with some witty humor among Ains and his subordinates during down time and you got a large cast of good villains brimming with personality and power. Overlord is by far one of the best power fantasy anime on the market, and is well worth the watch for those looking for a good isekai. (Yes, it is in fact a isekai, a great one too!)",4.5
overlord,Great overall. The story progresses very slowly but makes up for it with a lot of world building and character building that keeps you curious about what comes next. Animation rating I would give 7.5-8.5 out of 10. There are moments where I would have liked to see more effort placed into the art work rather than the use of CG but overall does not take away from the show. Season 3 however used more CG than the previous seasons and I'm hoping this does not become a trend with the series. Nice mix of MMO and Dungeon and Dragon terminology. Excellent fantasy setting. Seasons may need re-watching to pick up on subtle hints left in dialogue that later are brought up. My overall rating is 8.5/10 or 4/5 stars. The missing star is due to the over use of CG and unnecessary dialogue at times.,4.5
overlord,"This anime will not be for you if you are a pleb. Sounds harsh but its true. If you like naruto or sao or have only seen like 2 anime you wont enjoy this. Its not a hero story, its not a fan service plot line of hero surmounts everything. Its as the title says a series about an all powerful overlord who basically always gets his way. The anime certainly doesn't do as much justice as the book, so if you like to enjoy in mild comedy and sinister over tones. I recommend the book first and foremost. The anime is still wonderful imo, its not a super wealthy series so you can see some animation flaws. But here's the thing, its unique to the sense that we finally get to root for an evil guy. If you're tired of constant good guys being good just because, and you want to see the consequences of peoples actions. Then THIS is the series for you. Because its good to be evil.",5
overlord,One of the best isekai animations I've watched and the main cast of the show are all amazing characters. The fact that ainz doesnt bulls**t wins out of the love of his friends or last moment clutches from his a**. If this show ever gets canceled before the writer finishes the light novels especially with all the arcs and material he could create I would be very upset because this is in my top 5 favourite animes,5
overlord,"I'm not a hardcore anime guy, but I do watch quite a lot. Somewhere in-between casual and hardcore. Anyway! Overlord is amazing. i'd heard about it for awhile, but never bothered looking into it. The basic premise by the description isn't the most original, guy gets stuck in a game, lots of anime like that. But this one is totally different! Not only is the main character essentially a villain of sorts, they aren't afraid to spend lots of time on NPC's or side characters. The world building is top notch, and a good blend of action, humor and personal stories make this anime hard to stop watching.",5
overlord,"The first episode of Overlord game me a sort of Sword Art Online vibe. It's about a player  who's trapped within an Virtual Reality Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (VRMMORPG). However, that's about the only thing that these two share in common. Everything else COMPLETELY different.The main character, formerly Momonga, now Ainz Ooal Gown, is formerly a normal guy working as a sales person. He's not talented or special in any way. He's an average person with a job. He just loves the game he's playing in. When the game was announced to be shut down, he stayed until shutdown. Then he awoke in a new world, now only in control of his avatar turned real body and now talking to the NPC's that he and his guild members created.What's compelling about the main character is that he's ultimately just a guy trying to hold the reins in a situation that he has no idea about. Despite playing up to the role of the Lord of Death and Overlord of the Great Tomb of Nazarick, he's still learning and trying to be better.The cast of characters is plentiful and interesting as well. From the lovely Albedo to the kinky Shalltear to the quirky twins Aura and Mare, all the NPC's brought to life are a treat to watch.There's no real sense of danger, but all the same, it's fun to watch Ainz crush stupid people and anyone who thinks they have a snowball in hell's chance of beating him or his powerful and numerous servants. Also just as enjoyable is the sense of discovery. New territories and kingdoms are fun to see because Ainz and his minions actively shape the world around them, making them active protagonists.Also, this is a different spin of the guy trapped in the game because the guy isn't the good guy. He's a magical skeleton, so he plays the role of an evil monster, even if that isn't necessarily who he is as a person.If you still need convincing, there are plenty of battles, lots of excellent dialogue, and well-crafted animations.Give the ""trapped in a game"" anime another chance.",5
overlord,"Unlike most of the ""All-powerful normal off-worlder who jumps into the video game realm anime"", Overlord includes a lot of perspectives as the main character tackles challenges in the new realm (which is referred to as Yggdrasil)Ains Ooal Gown, or the Main character, is a normally office worker who decides to visit a video game he and his friends have played on since the beginning. He wants to reminisce about in his memories when his friends were still online who no longer play the game due to IRL problems. Suddenly, he is transported into Yggdrasil where he gains the help of the NPC's his friends made and then the story goes on from there.What makes this unique is the fact that Kugane Maruyama, the creator of Overlord, puts in perspectives of simple adventurers, towns, hell, even politics in the mix to create a sense of an actual world. People who  matter to Ains Ooal Gown himself. This creates relationships with the NPCs or his ""comrades"" and makes sense in future plot ideas forward.The cast is actually not that forgettable. It's pretty easy remembering who is the supporting cast and who is the main cast. I highly recommend this show. It's incredibly refreshing in comparison the to the shows who follow the tropes with just pure, PURE fanservice.",5
overlord,On a serious note. I am seriously happy to see such a contrast from your typical pussy male leads in majority of the other Animes. We all know Ains is OP but its still so interesting to see him work towards his goals in confidence. The pacing is on point. Story is very creative. I can't stress enough how incredibly refreshing it is to see a Male lead who isn't constantly second guessing himself and is confident and believes in himself. This is a seriously satisfying show to watch.,5
overlord,"This is by far my favorite -oh boy I'm now possibly trapped in a video game- anime. I only started watching this because Log Horizon was taking forever.Art:★★★★★ - Never been upset with how something was drawn, the CGI is done pretty well too. Doesn't go too over the top on death scenes.Story:★★★★☆ - Characters have great development. The direction is a little loose and slow to deliver but the wait is generally worth it.",5
overlord,"This show is AMAZING its amazing, it is a show with great character righting and is unlick most other animes,  of a simalar theme Ex; Sword art online, how not to summon a demon lord, or any other shows that involve being stuck in anotherworld though how not to summon a demon lord is like this but several layers down in greatness, Momonga ( Ainz Ooal Gown ) Is a simple Man who is a social nightmare, has close to no skills for being a leader, and is overal like a loser, but suddenly he is thrust into a situation he cant controll, he is unfamilar with being a leader, a role model, A  Overlord. The characters are amazing too, such interesting personalitys, such a wide veriaty too, and it isnt just one storyline , we have had 3 so far, and i hope to have many many more.",5
overlord,"This anime is perfect. The characters are all unique and special in some way. I'll also like to add that the creator did a fantastic job in their story building. This anime has the perfect mix of action, comedy, and a bit of romance. Also, I love seeing the characters progress and get stronger, like ( *SPOILER*) Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideBrain Unglaus for example. His fight with Shalltear Bloodfallen has tore his will and confidence apart but recovered and managed to... give her a free nail cut? But that's still progress unlike the time where he didn't even touch her. (excluding the part where she catches the blade). I'll give this series a 5/5 for story building and unique characters. I'm looking forward to the next episode.",5
overlord,"It's a great adaptation of the old being sucked into a game world motif. They do a great job portraying what an individual would actually do in that situation, and have fun with it because he is an undead and his guild consists of only nonhuman people. So you get to see the MC try and learn about the world as he travels and quests as ""Momon,"" and you also see him be a badass as Ains Oowl Gown. I would recommen this show to anyone that like anime honestly, probably would give it an 8 or 9/10",5
overlord,"Overlord puts a refreshing twist on the Isekai subgenre, a subgenre constantly plagued with subpar content and lackluster protagonists, with the protagonist this time being not an O.P. hero but rather an O.P. villain. He is the overlord of evil minions capable of annihilating entire kingdoms that worship him as a literal god. One would think this would be the usual Isekai experience; however, as Youtuber Mother's Basement said in his review, ""What's So Great About Overlord,"" the main character actually feels like a socially awkward yet genuine guy. This creates a fantastic dynamic with him trying to act cool in front of these actually evil villains and keep up with their schemes that they think he has planned a trillion steps ahead of them. This coupled with a vast array of characters the show is one of the most refreshing and entertaining out there -- even if the embarrassing nature of the openings make me want to slam my head into my desk at Mach five.",4.5
overlord,"Overlord has become the #1 for me. It's the only series I have waited on almost religiously every week to be released since I discovered it, since when DragonBall Z was airing throughout the initial 3 arcs. I refuse to read the manga until the animation has ""completed;"" so I can re-experience it in it's written form. There have been so many entries into this genre of anime, but I feel like this one is the first one, for me, which truly is doing it right. I won't compare it to others by name but I'm sure we can all think of a few ""almosts"" to the stuck-in-a-game setting.It's got the right touch of residual game-world mechanics in a realistic (relative to anime) environment, incredible character and world building, immense depth to characters (both expendable, and not); No way to tell which characters are gonna bite the dust, so you develop attachments to all of the characters built, and pray they survive / mourn if they do not. The show has a dual nature where you will root and fear BOTH sides of the coin, good and evil. Watching the MC struggle to weigh his decisions in-character as evil or check them against his more ""human (player-like / fourth wall)"" decisions adds a greater level of depth to the story. The twist that NPCs are slowly evolving and could potentially change drastically from their game counterparts is a nasty, but exciting fringe benefit.My greatest worry was squashed quickly; ""if he's basically max level living in starter town, won't this get boring?"" NOPE! Turns out the threats of real-life to everyone but him are far more terrifying when put into context of the MC's ambitions. The added layer of actually caring about dozens of other characters the MC's decisions affect make you think what YOU would do in that situation, and worry if the choices he's making will impact things/people you care about. It's a dynamic I don't think I've ever experienced to this degree in anything aside from actual RPG games where I have direct control over character interaction.I will refrain from any more in fear of spoiling stuff. If you're on the fence, just watch the first few episodes. You'll be hooked. I mean hell, I finally made a username just to post this. Enjoy.",4.5
overlord,"The characters are cool, the overlord is intriguing and flawed (but don't tell any of the minions that), the pacing is completely perfect, and although the main character seems OP, there is clearly a threat in the world.This anime captures wonderfully the danger of the unknown and the benefit of a methodical and planned approach to things. A refreshing change from the headstrong protagonist that charges in despite knowing nothing and prevailing because of plot convenience. While I understand that a careful planner may not seem to be an obvious choice of character to make an interesting story, this is a stellar example of how to do that and make it shine.Lastly, it always has a great OP and ED.",5
overlord,"TL;DR: 9.4/10. Definitely worth watching.Overlord is a high fantasy anime where the MC ends up in his favorite game's world. As is often the case with this genre, the MC is stupidly overpowered from the get-go, which often leads to a severe case of ""I know the MC is going to win anyway, so there is no suspense"" syndrome. Luckily, this is not the case in Overlord, Overlord excels where most animes fail: World building and character building. This ultimately leads to relatable weaker characters that have struggles, ambitions, dreams, and woes.10/10 Story(It's a bit slow at times, due to the aforementioned world/character building, though since this is what gives the show an edge over every other ""Trapped in a game world"" Anime I've seen, it doesn't subtract anything from the score. And isn't as fleshed out as it ought to be due to its relatively short seasons)10/10 Humor(I seldom laugh at Animes. This one tickles my funny bone, though)10/10 Characters(Due to the large percentage of time dedicated to character building, it lands on 10/10. The characters induce a sense of sonderness. Which is what every character should do.)7/10 Animation(It's good, just not spectacular. Doesn't take away anything from the show, but probably won't age that well, IMO)10/10 Lore(Lore is important in any Anime set in a game world. Overlord excels at this part. Everything is extremely well done and fleshed out)All this lands Overlord at a well deserved 9.4/10 overall. Am I biased? Yes. Is Overlord worth watching? Absolutely.",5
overlord,"I like Overlord. My one problem is the fact that the rate of plot progression is too slow. Not in a boring filler way. The episodes are still genuinely engaging, but not enough happens in a season. Overlord is structured in a way one would expect a longer series to be structured but doesn't have the season length to justify this. If there were large seasons like 24 episode long or it had BEEFY long-ass episodes this wouldn't be a problem but with only 13 20 or so minute episodes in a season, the end of a season (season 2 in particular) feels way too early.",3
overlord,"TL;DR:  Thicc Skeleton Daddy doesn't even need his golden pimp cane to crush lesser Isekai into submission. The undisputed Overlord of the Isekai genre, Overlord is the epitome of what this genre should and can be.  Through great storytelling, world building, and a beautiful supporting cast with plot for days; Overlord now sits at the top demanding other shows to get on its level.The protagonist Momonga (aka. Ainz Ooal Gown, aka. Big Skeleton Daddy [B.S.D.]), starts off as the stereotypical gamer who has a hard time socializing with others; so he role plays as his character instead-The basic character formula that almost every Isekai shares. But after three seasons, even though he can still be unsure at times, B.S.D. has come a long way.  He's steadily evolves as a character, grown as a leader, demonstrates a knack for strategy and ability to learn from both successes & failures.  While other Isekai craft a story for their socially awkward op protagonist to follow, Overlord instead has the protagonist create the story themselves. What a novel concept! B.S.D. ends his first day in this new world with the goal of conquering it-not having to defeat the evil demon king in a far away land or save the world from a great evil; B.S.D. is that big bad and trounces every other would be conqueror that would dare impede his progress toward that goal.  The same man who role played as the absolute ruler of his MMORPG has continued that same role in this new world. This anime speaks to the fact that given the power, resources, and opportunity to take over the world & shape it the way you'd want to, you would do it.  If you were all powerful and could wield magic & armies at your command, you wouldn't follow someone else as they guide you on a journey-you'd carve your own path.  You would do whatever you wanted to do.  And it just so happens that what B.S.D. wants is world domination. You owe it to yourself to watch this anime.",5
overlord,"So many animes and shows tend to follow tropes of following the good guy, and fighting against the bad guy. Overlord stands above so many other shows by creating a world that is not only more complex than a lot of other shows, but the main characters of the show are not necessarily protagonists, and are most certainly not heros. In fact, some could be seen as outright villains. The main character himself is not your average anime hero, but an undead skeleton. And he does not need to learn his abilities or power, he already has them day one. This allows the show to concentrate more on the world, and the character development itself, rather than overcoming physical fight obstacles. His flaws come from who he used to be in the old world, making him much more complex. He also deals with the fact that despite him being surrounded by adoring subjects and minions, he is in fact quite lonely as he had been practically abandoned by his friends.Not just that, but because of the way the main character is, and his supporting characters, there is a real sense of risk to the minor characters. People who have personalities and character built up, and are even seen as important to the story, may very well end up dead, sometimes even in pointless ways. Innocent people DO DIE because of the main character, and remorse for these actions is not shown by him.If there are some flaws to the show, it would be that sometimes stories can be rushed a little quickly, and aren't given quite enough time to be fleshed out. Another flaw is that sometimes it seems like the story goes in unnecessary directions, for seemingly nothing but filler. A good example of this would be the first half of season 2, which seems to focus on characters that almost seem unimportant, while the main characters take a back seat. However, I personally do not think this is the case as it builds the world, and sets up the stage for future parts.All in all though, I can easily say this is one of my favorite animes, if not my favorite simply because of it's magnificent storytelling, fun characters, expansive world, with a good bit of humor, wit, and power mixed in.",5
overlord,"One of my favorite things to see in anime is when a show takes a stereotypical situation and simply flips it, fajumbles it, makes it all wibbly-wobbly.Overlord does this beautifully, from the rivalry between Albedo and Shalltear, to the great fight scenes, this Anime had me completely immersed for the entirety of the ride. (SPOILERS)My favorite part of the second season was all of the utter confusion. I loved how everyone was fighting everyone thinking they were someone else. The biggest disappointment was that there wasn't a scene where everyone just stopped fighting and said: ""wait a minute are you fighting for the Eight Fingers?"" ""No we just beat the crap out of them"" ""then why are we fighting?"" ""You attacked first"" ""oops""(done)Can't wait for season 3 and hope they delve deeper into the stories of the guardians and give some more of that sweet sweet character growth like we got with sebas.",4
overlord,"First review, this show brought me to it. There's an indescribable feeling of contentment I derive from overpowered main characters. I enjoyed one-punch man and mob psycho 100, so naturally I enjoyed this, too. There's plenty of comic relief, accompanied by a considerable amount of ass-kicking done by the protagonists. Characters are building well in my opinion. Soundtrack is bad-ass and definitely impressionable. 10/10 would recommend.",4
overlord,"The show tends to get a little slow towards the middle and pics it back up in the end of every season so far and that's not a bad thing. The creators have brought more dimension to the supporting cast of characters. The first Season being Mostly about the MC Lord Ains, Season 2 takes it by probing more into the Secondary characters The Floor Guardians And 3 seems to be going into the Maid Staff and others around the background all while the MC takes a steady rise to power in this new world.A must watch for those who enjoy High Fantasy or Story Driven RPG's",5
overlord,"There is not much i can add as far as reviews go . After watching season 1 and 2 I can say i Really enjoyed this show , and i hope it comes back for another season or 2 .I started watching the show on a whim , i was bored and not much looked interesting .I prefer darker , more mature anime.I was pleasantly surprised and as i stated above i quite enjoyed the show .I recommended it to my son and he liked it also .",4
darling-in-the-franxx,"There is a great deal of depth to this anime, far beyond the surface level cries of 'sexual exploitation' that some are spouting. The society depicted in this anime mirrors our own in a few unique ways. For one, I do not look at the process of piloting the FRANXX as 'male dominance'. The themes evident here are immediately sexual. As such, the male-female duo is not unlike the act of procreation in our world. Much like our world, the female is responsible for generating 'life'. The male plugs into the female and both work together to create a child. In DARLING in the FRANXX, this same duo is creating the energy, or life, to pilot the mech. Indeed, while many may blindly see this as 'male exploitation of women', can you also not say that the male is dependent on the female partner? The plot even says that they must be in perfect resonance in order to function. They both NEED to rely on one another in order to succeed. There are no duplicitous motives, only harmonious ones. Philosophies aside, the animation is top-notch, and Zero Two takes the spotlight as an engaging character that adds much to the movement of the plot. She is sporadic, barbaric, romantic, and unusual, and has both a primal and refined take on 'love'. Her affection for her 'darling' is slightly overbearing, if not excessive at times (blood and saliva seem to be regularly shared to symbolize their connection), but it is also refined as she employs the heartfelt and classic pet name 'darling' to describe her feelings. The way she gazes upon him fondly, caresses his head, and confronts those who might challenge their relationship, is indicative of a more civilized mind. All in all, I look forward to seeing how the merger of these two lost and lonely souls brings them a renewed life together.",4.5
darling-in-the-franxx,"This show has a very slow build up exploring relations ships and what it means to be human in a world where humans have stripped themselves of humanity. Kids raised more like machines than people struggle to understand how to relate to each other.World building Is slow and gradual but almost every episode, You get a new puzzle piece of the bigger picture, Prepare to take a while to start putting things together, But it's done very well.The action takes a back seat to characters, This show inst' really about the mecha at all, and the action is more of a backdrop for where the characters are in their relationships, but the writing Is very creative and tells it's story very differently than anything I'm used to. And I always am excited about what surprises the next will bring. Episode Charter development has been pretty great.I didn't like the protagonist at first, he seemed far too stale and passive, but as episodes when in my opinion of him has really changed as I've come to realize that given the environment he was raised in he's actually a very strong and independent individual, steps ahead of everyone around him.Episode 13 was a real treat the brought on some feels and Had some Elfen Lied vibes. (not in the gore and nudity department) but in some very similar mood and concepts.I've noticed many people complaining about the slow pace or the last few episodes being ""filler"". when to be these episodes were filed with charter development and interesting unique writing. I guess if you're expecting a fast-paced action mecha show then this show just isn't for you. Personally, with each passing episode, my enjoyment of this show is becoming on par with some of my personal favorites such as FMAB Fate/zero and Gurren Laggan.",5
darling-in-the-franxx,"What a strong debut! The show is like Kill La Kill, Gundam 00, and Gurren Lagann all had a baby together, which for me is awesome because it combines concepts from series that I love. Studio Trigger is back in top form with this new mecha anime. It feels like the true successor to both Kill La Kill and Gurren Lagann. I thoroughly enjoyed the first episode. The animation is top notch and the fight scenes are dynamic and flashy. The characters are interesting. My personal favorite is the mischievous mad scientist/top notch soldier 002. The concept of male and female pilot pairs is interesting and original. I plan to tune in to watch it each week and you should definitely give it a watch!",5
darling-in-the-franxx,"So far only two episodes are out and this is what i understand of the show.The show is a giant metaphor about relationships, sex, and intimacy. The robot is something symbolic of the relationship between the people controlling it, two people who can manage a good relationship are able to control it well and trust in each other. This can be further observed with the societal and parental pressure to have an operating relationship (robot) that these characters were expected of having. The main character, though, has obvious troubles of intimacy and understanding of what a relationship, reflecting his inability to pilot with just anyone. This is where Zero 2 has problems. She can't maintain an effective relationship with most people since its forced and they don't fully accept her. She will try to ""pilot"" it solo, this creates a toxic relationship that hurts both herself and her partner, often killing her partner.All of this is wrapped up in a ridiculous and gorgeous package that trigger animation is known to offer. Extremely entertaining, tons of sexual innuendos, and a very interesting way to deliver a metaphoric commentary on today's relationships. Can't wait to see where the show goes next!Edit: Now that i'm 8 episodes in i'm going to have to knock off a star for a couple reasons. 1. Hiro is a super boring character. Extremely bland, predictable, lacks personality. He doesn't have any interesting thoughts especially after the 5th episode. 2. The animation/art is usually pretty good and excellent in key moments. However, the bad moments are REALLY bad. Extremely obvious when the work is outsourced. It grossly contrasts the moments/episodes that are handled extremely well (such as the first episode). It's at its worst when the character models look awful and the environment is plain and boring.2.5. To pair with the animation, some episodes and scenes within the episode don't seem well directed at all. The first two episodes and a couple others have some excellent direction and scene construction that communicate the show to the viewer extremely well. A lot of this is somewhat lacking in several of what i dub to be the low budget episodes.Overall i feel like the show has taken a step backwards from its original episodes. Hopefully it will turn around and progress the plot while better developing Hiro since he remains to be the weakest part of the show.",5
darling-in-the-franxx,"I will admit by the second episode all of the sexual innuendos had me feeling rather uncomfortable in terms of the focus for this series. At this point in the series Im starting to get the feel of whats going on and rather than cringe I feel myself accepting all the sexual references as part of the art style/aesthetic. I was worried that the show would rely on its sexual nature too much and start to slide into ecchi territory (no pun intended). THIS IS NOT THE CASE. I feel the sexual nature of the show is less of an innuendo and more of a metaphor and references the intimacies of interconnected relations between two individuals. Im excited for further development, I honestly haven't had this much fun with an anime for a while!",4
darling-in-the-franxx,"As of the first hour of so of content I can say with a good amount of confidence that this is well worth watching. It does very well at introducing its characters and world without giving you too little or too much.Basically, do yourself a favor and just watch it, your brain will thank you later.----Possible Spoilers Past This Point---Is it original? As it is with any series, debatable. The art style and functioning (Libido power stuff) of the mechs is similar to Star Driver, the driving force of plot around the MC is similar to Argevollen where he's the only one who'll be accepted. These kids were raised in a lab for one purpose similar to those in Hamatora, like Bungo Stray Dogs most all of their names have some meaning/reference to reality. The way some characters see the Mc is like how Chidori sees Katsuhira in Kiznaiver and the sheer brute force of the mechs and blood from both the creatures and humans reminds me of Iron Blooded Orphans. I'm sure you could also throw Eureka Seven, Kill La Kill, My Hero Academia and a few others in there lol",5
darling-in-the-franxx,"THIS ANIME IS SOOOOOO GOOD. Episodes like 14 and 20 made me cry alot. it gets pretty emotional and got me on a personal level idk why. i RECREMEND that you watch this its realllllyyyy good. it starts off kind-of weird and boring, but if you have patience it all will start to make since, it gets better as you watch it trust me. it ends really well, i hope they will make a 2nd season. the cliffhanger though ;^;  IF YOU DONT WATCH THIS ANIME I WILL FIND YOU AND KILL YOU Thank you for reading my reveiw.  and PLEASE DO ME A FAVOR AND WATCJH THIS ANIMEEEEE????❤❤❤????",5
darling-in-the-franxx,"Enjoyed this show from start till towards end. refreshing and enjoyable, brought something new to the robot / mecha genre.only gripe is that god awful ending that almost put me off recommending the show.SPOILERS:reincarnation is always a cop out of an ending and bringing a new enemy in very last minute without any explanation is poor writing. standard for trigger though.still a definite watch though8/10",5
darling-in-the-franxx,"I don't usually write reviews, but when I do then it's because I truly cherish an anime. DARLING in the FRANXX can be categorized into several genres but it doesn't necessarily pop out in any of them. And that's what I like about it. It tackles so many things at once, truly making a unique anime viewing experience. Now I, along with many others, believe that this anime had so much potential but was wasted towards the end. They could have easily made the plot stretch into another season, but instead it ended in a somewhat underwhelming way. Some people dislike it for this, and I used to as well. However, I realized that the impact this anime left upon me once I finished it meant something. It meant that I loved it, although I seemingly didn't want to. This is when I came to the conclusion that I have to accept it for what it was, not what it could have been. Sure, I was aware of the flaws in this anime, but it takes an actual fan to truly admire both the flaws and strengths of a show. In the end, this is what it boiled down to for me. I can't speak for everyone and I may not know much about what makes an anime truly good, but what I do know is that I love this anime. Inside and out.",5
darling-in-the-franxx,"The plot for most of the show was top tier. I mean TOP TIER. The mysterious nature of everyone outside of squad 13 and their inability to understand what to do with their feelings and growing interest in their own world and lives made for an interesting show. With that said, I absolutely loved this show, recommended it to every anime friend I have, and have Zero Two as one of the backgrounds on my MacBook. If the plot didn't dive off a cliff towards the end, it would have been an easy 5 stars. I'll probably rewatch the first half of the show at some point next year. Until then, I'll be waiting for new Sword Art, Re:ZERO, and Danmachi.",5
darling-in-the-franxx,"Ok ok all innuendoes, and sex jokes aside. There really isn't a whole lot to go off of with only two episodes so far. But,  you cant help but be completely drawn into this. The animation is beautifully done, and its refreshing to have thematic developments entirely around playful sexual chemistry. Honestly, I started the show the second episode was released and have watched both over multiple times. There is an enchanting mystery around this. Really looking forward to see where it takes us over the next 22 episodes. *Tips hat to Trigger*",5
darling-in-the-franxx,"I'll do my best to keep this one short and to the point.I have no illusions to what this anime is and tried to be. It's a romance anime disguising itself as a mecha anime with a lot of political and social commentary.I didnt think the poly/soc commentary in the show was particularly deep. I mean, it's not like it isnt something that hasnt been said and done before... but it is refreshing to have it said time and again, because it does need to be every so often.Now i had absolutely no problem with the ideas the more episodes i watched, but the presentation and execution was downright sloppy in most cases. This anime had the potential to be outstanding, and the ideas were fantastic. Unfortunately, it did not live up to itself and instead played it extremely safe by giving us a formula that was already done before...I've watched all 25 episodes, and i have to say the ride was... interesting, to put it extremely generously. The show started off very strong in the first episode. The world was unique and set up in a brilliant way, and the characters were all introduced very well too. People could argue that it was very much like TTGL (Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann) from the very start in that humans are being suppressed by a superior race and are forced to essentially live in a post apocalyptic world, but i honestly never got that impression from the beginning.i wouldnt say this show was bad by any stretch.Now... that's not to say that it was any good, either.Because episodes 2-9 were an absolute slog. Remember how exciting and fresh episode 1 was? Well take all of that away. Throw in a lot of mellow drama, the strelizia doing something cool maybe once every couple episodes for 10 second and completely lackluster/meaningless character interactions and you have that 8 episode stretch down to a tee.Epsidoes 2-9 were mediocre as all hell.Now episodes 10-15, on the other hand? They were really enjoyable. And you know what? it was very much the same sort of stuff that we saw in the previous episodes with a lot of character focus and minimal action set pieces. What was the difference, you ask? The things that happened actually had significance.We got much more insight about the sort of world our characters live in.The characters were developed in meaningful ways.We had actual plot progression.Things were happening in a way that mattered to the narrative, and the characters themselves. And it was great! Unfortunately, things don't stay that way for long. episodes 16-19 were pretty non descript in the same way that 2-9 were. not much else to say there.and oh my god episode 20 has to be...  Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideone of the worst plot twists i've ever seen in my entire lifethe show literally turns into gurren lagann in that ""the klaxosaurs(beastmen) werent our true enemies, and it turns out our true enemies are spacemen who want to annihilate all of earths inhabitants(the spiral races)"". Episode 21-24 is a continuation of that ""arc"", and the only parts i found enjoyable were when the kids were having a normal life by farming and doing other miscellaneous things. oh. and that 5 minutes where everyone was in space to get the super strelizia(super TTGL) to the warp gate. that was also pretty cool.  Now let's talk characters....None of them particularly stand out with the exception of 002, Hiro, and Dr. Franxx. Becuase the show actually puts a lot of focus on themSpoiler Alert! Click to show or hidewith Dr. Franxx development coming near the end of the series right before he dies, giving us virtually no time to really care about him. he has no defining character qualities, we just get a lot of insight into his past.. which, again, who cares?Hiro is easy to tackle: He's generic shounen/anime protag #900. Nice guy to a fault, loves to help his friends even at the cost of his own well being, gets the hot girl without being particularly special or doing anything impressive. This cliche is getting pretty tired, but it's still an easy one to role with so i dont really knock the show for it.002 is also a pretty simple character to break down, in that shes a callous woman who doesn't care for anyone but herself until her ice cold heart is warmed up by our Hiro (haha, get it?) and she becomes true to her (and every other girl in anime that's just like her) natrue and becoems very gentle, considerate, and kind hearted.Ichigo: Well, her defining characteristic is that she loves Hiro. I mean... yeah. That's basically it. She's also the leader of their squad (but not really).Zorome, or as i like to call him Discount Na(Bo)ruto, is a head strong dummy who bullied Hiro at first, but quickly became his pal again after their extremely shallow conflict got resolved. Miku is just a girl version of Zorome, but i'll admit i did enjoy the dynamic between hr and Zorome (being that they were paired)Ikuno is the quiet nerdy girl with no characteristics other than being in love with Ichigo. Yeah, go wild with that one i guess.Mitsuru is a completely boring block of wood with a chip on his shoulder about Hiro, which like Zorome, gets over it pretty fast once the benign conflict gets resolved. Futoshi just love to eat and loves Kokoro. That's basically it.Kokoro is the sweety of the show. The cupcake if you willSpoiler Alert! Click to show or hideThat is, until she cucks fatty hardcore by straight up lying to his face and saying she'll be his partner forever, and then turning her back on him within a ten minute time span. For Mitsuru no less, whose about as boring as Ikuno is.Goro is the overly-reasonable best friend to Hiro, who is in love with Ichigo By the way, are you noticing a pattern with these characters, in that their defining characteristics is that they like eachother?My problem is that none of these characters have any depth as people. Some of their pasts and back stories get fleshed out well enough, but these characters themselves feel like aliens pretending to be people. None of them stand out. At all. The interactions is where i derived most of my enjoyment from this series as a whole, but even then only about half of them were actually worth a damn. The show was geared more towards growing the cast as a collective, rather than individually.But this idea doesn't work when there is so much more focus put on Hiro and 002 than all of the other characters. So they all end up falling flat.And i mean that's pretty much all i have to say. I hate the fact that i don't particularly care for this show. Because, again, it had great potential.I haven't been this disappointed with a series since Sword art: online, however i wouldnt put this show on the same tier of awful that SAO is. Should you watch this show?Honestly, despite everything i said, i would say yes. The show is as mid tier as it gets and it doesn't really go out of the box, but it still has a lot of enjoyable moments even though its not being as good as it could have been. But at the end of the day, id' honestly say to just go and watch Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann instead or at the very least before watching this for some points of reference and the fact that it's much better. My reviews arent exactly popular, and i realize that, but that aint gonna stop me from writing them.So until next time!",4.5
darling-in-the-franxx,"Darling in the FranXX is an instant classic. I'm not even talking about how 002 stormed in and dominated the yearly waifu rankings, or how Ichigo somehow managed to fight for the ""best girl"" slot against her. The ensemble cast isn't wasted and each and every character has a role to play. 13 episodes into the series and we have seen all 10 kids go through growth and development beyond what some anime do for one character alone. It's the combination of all of these things that blow me away, but it's not the most surprising thing to me.Darling in the FranXX is not there to hold your hand. The information that NEEDS to be passed along, is done pretty well. It's not all spoon-fed, but it's not hard to access either. But the information that you WANT, the stuff that makes the show so good is often snuck in. They don't make everything obvious. Instead, we're given little glances into their lives. The way they live, the way the world used to be, and how the world works now. The show expects you to have a kind of curiosity about the questions it offers. It also gives answers if you're willing to look for them.I'm not going to spoil anything about the show, but if you've been looking for an excuse to watch it, this is it.",4.5
darling-in-the-franxx,"Trigger has done it again. Seriously awesome. Their usual flair and lack of sanctity make this ride one I plan on enjoying the whole way down. Just get off whatever high horse you're on (metaphorical or otherwise) and allow yourself to like this. It's okay, no one will judge you.That said, expect mecha action, interpersonal relationship conflict, and socio-religious critique we've all come to expect from Trigger/Gainax. Enjoy!",4
darling-in-the-franxx,"From the post-apocalyptic society battling random creatures in heavy machinery all the way to outer space battles that no one would expect from the beginning of the anime, it is very reminiscent of Gurren Lagann. It is good, do not get me wrong, it's just there were not many aspects to this show that have not already been done before. As always, the way things are differ from show to show, but they all have most of the same over and undertones. I enjoyed the very humanistic aspect of the parasites, on how they are very much so developing into teenagers and adults throughout the span of the series. Children will always be a product of their environments, but they'll still have their innate curiosity that will truly allow them to grow into their individual personalities. However, parts of the show gets to the point that everyone is into anyone and it's like watching a high school drama of confined spaces and small dating pools, BLEH. Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideThe best episodes of the series are 13 and 19, and they also give much of the backstory you lust for in the beginning of the series.",5
darling-in-the-franxx,"3.5 starsSimply drawn but well animated art. Over the top combat. These are things the studio is known for.The first episode is somewhat cliched. However as the series progresses, the plot shifts gears multiple times. First the main characters are introduced and the stage is set. You'll get an idea of what humanity has become. But then you'll soon learn that the main cast is different, as they begin to discover what being human means to them. There's a lot of innuendo and nearly sexual content, but it's not done in the typical way. It's done through the eyes of naive children who are coming of age and don't know what that means. The story spends a lot of time on the unrequited love of youth, exploring the characters attempts to make sense of their place in the world, and their connections with each other. The plot will change directions a few times. Because the plot changes so much as the series continues, it does feel like you're watching something completely different at times. But it was entertaining in it's own way.",3

Now he has to choose between doing it with her, despite knowing it is killing him slowly or not do it all. He chooses to keep doing it with her.",5
darling-in-the-franxx,"This show has so much potential. It's not just the fabulous Studio Trigger and solid A-1 pictures, It has a lot of big names behind the scenes also working on it. Theres also a manga running simultaneously with the anime. The Author of the manga is Kentaro Yubuki the artist from To-Love Ru so you know the art is on point. The animation looks stunning the musical score so far is solid and some characters are really standing out. Especially Zero Two. There are some serious undertones and metaphors to the dual gender piloting system that you will see almost immediately but I think it makes it more interesting. Episode 4 has phenomenal I would highly recommend you get to that episode before figuring out if you want to continue it.",5
darling-in-the-franxx,"If possible, I will definitely give more than a five star. Best anime, and I truly enjoy every episode of the anime.

Will stay tuned for any subsequent series for this anime.Fantastic storyline and amazing efforts in character development. Well done producer.",4
darling-in-the-franxx,"Darling in the FranXX has an unfortunate name. It sounds like some kind of french drama that I would never be interested in watching. Combine that with a photo that screams Full Metal Panic knock-off, and one could hardly be blamed for swiping left. That said, I WAS DEAD WRONG. Equal parts Eureka Seven, Evangelion, and Tenchi Muyo, with splashes of S-cry-ed, SAO, and Guilty Crown, (and the occasional Studio Ghibli slash Makoto Shinkai vibe), Darling really delivers. It even follows a love story reminiscent of (and every bit as good as) The Fountain... This anime is a rare gem, a true masterpiece. I found it pleasantly surprising that there was very little military or politics in this show. This isn't Gundam nor G.A.T.E. -- It's Gurren Lagan, but a million times better. The characters range from tired cliché to truly unique and are developed well throughout the show. The plot has slow, enjoyable moments and fast, insane action. There are small inter-personal conflicts, literally world-ending conflicts, and healthy doses of both sci-fi and fantasy. This is the type of world that offers secrets and wonders for all types of fans. I spent a good portion of my time wondering about the origin of the Franxx machines, Dr. Franxx himself, and APE. I even came up with a whole theory about Mankind having evolved to the point of becoming Klaxosaurs and APE were literally the evolved descendants of apes and monkeys, using bio-engineered human test tube babies to pilot giant robots in a war to kill off the rest of Humanity à la-Ender's Game, but again I was wrong. PLOT TWIST!   Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideThe council of elders was actually being run by an alien collective consciousness, klaxo sapiens were the original sentient life on Earth, and the children must combine humanity and klaxo-kind to defeat their common enemy! Whew.  In the end, I found myself wishing Hiro and Zero Two would continue their story in a second season, no matter how lame the story loophole. Time travel, alternate universes, whatever it takes! I might even make a little fan fiction for the the first time ever... Okay probably not, but I definitely give this the highest possible rating and recommend everyone watch it. For anyone still reading, yes there are sexual innuendos, get over it. There are also some annoying transliteration issues, like extremely liberal subtitles, and ""darling"" being pronounced ""tah-lee"". I love the Japanese language (#Subz4Lyfe) but the word darling is said about 9001 times in this show, so it gets really annoying. But don't let that stop you! Get going and watch this anime!",4

darling-in-the-franxx,"The title says it all. This is BY FAR my favourite anime ever created (and I’m a massive weeb, so i’ve seen A LOT of different anime). I mean, I’m one of those people that you look at and think “damn, I don’t wanna mess with that guy”, and here I was crying my eye balls out. It amazing, sure some people would disagree because of the ending and all that, but I think it was really good. The characters are incredibly detailed and filled with emotions. Because of this I can safely say that Zero-Two is now my ultimate waifu. I really can’t emxpress how much I love this anime and would recommend to anyone, I mean I’ve already spent about $500+ on merch and I’ve never bought merch from an anime before. The animation itself is also breathtaking and the voice acting whether your a dub or a sub, is superb. Literally the only bad thing I can say is, I wish there was more episodes, PLEASE GIVE US A SEASON 2 FOR THIS SHOW. Anyway, 100% recommend this show.",5
darling-in-the-franxx,"I initially wrote this to meet the character count but I ended up writing more so yeah:I expected this to be some normie run of the mill sci fi anime before I actually watched it. However, I was greeted by a much more captivating show than I expected. The story never leaves you without more questions about the future of the 10 adolescents under seemingly helpless circumstances. The underlying tone that reeks inevitable doom provokes curiosity and anxiousness as you see relationships develop between the protagonists. And then there's the opening sequence. That damn song. It's honestly one of the reasons I kept watching the show, as it too conveys the anxiousness and pain within the characters as a result of their environment. Also, I'm not a very emotional guy when I watch shows, but this one kept me holding back tears the entire time. It's because of how well the writing conveys the character's anxiousness, helping the audience feel the characters' struggles. Yeah I've said anxiousness several times now but that's really the best word to describe this show. It's a good trait to have, however. I also forgot to mention that the first time I watched it, I watched the entire damn thing in one day. I hope that says something even coming from a random dude in the internet.",4.5
darling-in-the-franxx,"This anime was amazing, I wish it would never end, one of the best animes I have watched. It really touches you, beside all the jokes and the sexual things that you can find,(I think it is part of the anime) it is really beautiful. Love it!I remember and feel everything when i watched the anime, if i see something related to it, i think it is something that will stay inside you by how the anime touched you, now the only thing to do is to pray for a second season, that the probability is low, its sad to say but it is. Only thing i can do now is to re-watch this anime a lot of times again and cry. This anime really touches you in the feelings, i wish they had made it with more careful in the last episodes, and at least did like 28 episodes i dont know, a little more longer, making everything more clear. If is not going to have a second season, the should do at least an OVA with a different ending idk, i wish i would have seen hiro and zero two together with the squad building their lives. Since hiro became a human/monster, they became a more beautiful couple after that. and i dont get why so much people hated the anime, i know about the last episodes and the ending, but just appreciate how beautiful the anime was you know. And beside this masterpiece it has some awesome musics too.Zero Two best girl.I heard people saying that they made something different in the manga, so if it don't have an ova or a second season the only choice is to read the manga end.",4.5
darling-in-the-franxx,"I'm not really a fan of mecha's, and honestly I wasn't too sure about this series when I started watching it, but after the first few episodes, I was hooked. From the character development, comedy, and to the more emotional parts, this is truly an amazing anime.  Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideI would love to see a second season following the two kids at the end of ep 24.Edit: The ending was complete utter trash compared to the rest of the show, come on Trigger, Aliens? Why... This show could have been so much more if they got the ending right.",5
darling-in-the-franxx,"ya boy cracked this can of feels open over the spring, its pretty chill with a good story till they do some crack in the second half. thank god i watched this high so it made perfect sense when it happened but anyone watching sober is gonna be thrown for a loop when they go full cray cray. besides we all know the reason the second half sucked is that the animators were scared to see what the hentai community would do with a beloved show with 18+ characters i mean jesus. this show was probably written by an AI that midway through production found a few unspecified sites and immediately committed suicide. they had no idea what to put so they took a line from the jojo's animators, like literally a line of coke and finished the series. giving this a 4 because i wrote this review high and it seems like a good even number",4
darling-in-the-franxx,"These are probably the best words that describe this anime. To be fair I have been hesitant to watch it for a while because of all the stigma around it. I found the first episodes difficult due to all the innuendos at every turn. However, I fell in love with it after that. The cast of characters is diverse and entertaining, the worldbuilding is fantastic, the action sequences are great, and the themes are intriguing. Honestly, I was hooked, Id watched 20 episodes in 3 days. However, in the last 5 episodes, it just got bizarre and things started making less and less sense. It felt rushed and like the director was just throwing a lot of whatever in a blender. The emotion of the final episodes was clouded by some of this nonsense. I would definitely recommend watching this, as I really did enjoy it and don't regret it for a second, however, its bumbles prevent me from giving it the highest of ratings.",5
darling-in-the-franxx,"So I watched the series in full and I enjoyed the ride that this anime took me on. To be honest, this was the first show/anime that made me cry especially at the end. The criticism behind the show is valid for sure and introduction of a new enemy with like 4 episodes left made the ending feel a little rushed and the changing of pace may seem a little weird. This change does remind me of what Gurren Lagann did but not as well executed. Overall though, this is an anime that has everything and I thoroughly enjoyed the story to its fullest. Plus, Zero Two is flippin adorable",5
darling-in-the-franxx,"DARLING in the FRANXX is an anime that I will come back to time and time again. The show started off relatively light-hearted, but the emotional and moral twists and turns gave this anime a very rare level of depth. Zero Two is an incredible female protagonist, with the perfect amounts of passion and devotion. A lot of female protagonists are overly affectionate, or artificially mysterious or distant, but Zero Two is an incredible example of passionate writing. The blend of her wild, animalistic side with her loving, romantic side hit me in ways I haven't experienced before.Simply put, I will always fondly remember DARLING in the FRANXX, and the connection that Zero Two and Hiro shared.",5
darling-in-the-franxx,"Darling In The Franxx was recommended to me by one of my friends months back, and I decided to check it out. Boy, was I happy I chose to. Darlifra's storyline and character development seemed to go along with each other and kept me hooked the entire time. The basic concept of a dystopian future is one I'm sure we have all seen before, but not to this aspect. As the title says, this anime was the first to truly pull my emotions from me, and leave me with a series that I can (in some aspects) relate my own life to, and enjoy to it's fullest extent. I've rewatched it 3 times, and I still find it almost as good as my initial experience. I recommend this to each and every one of you that may be surfing through the reviews to see if this is worth a watch. The impact it left on me is greater than any anime I've watched in my years of viewings, and It is for sure my favorite.",5
darling-in-the-franxx,"This was amazing!!! That ending made me cry so much!!! Please if season 2 will arrive, please make it awesome, and not bad. This anime made its way to my Top1 list. Just imagine a season 2 where Hiro and 02 (Their reincarnation) as they grow up, they discover about their ancestors (Hiro and 02 from the past) and realize that they are an actual reincarnation of them. However, Virm would still be alive and was preparing for a new attack. This time (The new) Hiro and 02 would be more powerful and more prepared to stop him. This time maybe without the death of these two amazing characters (Hiro and 02)!!! Just imagine. Obviously, Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideDeath of Hiro and 02  the creators of this anime would have more creativity for this anime, this is just me throwing some random idea",5
darling-in-the-franxx,"The anime started out okay. I wasn't expecting ALOT, but I can't say I didn't expect more. I love myself a good dystopian mecha anime but this wasn't it. Not everything about this show was bad. The beginning had a good amount of world building, character development, and some serious plot points. The conflict started around episode 17-18. The anime took a turn into becoming a huge twisted story about how the world came to be.Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hide Zero two became a huge klaxosaur, kokoro got pregnant(?), Hiro became a klaxosaur himself, Zero two and Hiro traveled out of space???? You get the gist right. I really wanted to like this anime. I enjoyed the character development. But it was so rushed, I could barely follow... I want to give this anime a 2.5/5. Zero Two is still bae though...",5
darling-in-the-franxx,"I really loved this anime, as it combined action and warfare (a subject I like to watch a lot), and romance (something that basically every anime has) very well. The character development was decent, and the plot was fairly realistic until the second half, where (SPOILERS) it became a humanity and klaxo sapiens versus VIRM alien war. Everything else seemed like it would have been possible to happen in real life. Overall, this anime is pretty good, and I would recommend it if you like a nice mix of romance and warfare.",5
darling-in-the-franxx,"Started off strong, beautiful art, the chicks were only moderately sexualized (which is the best ive come to hope for tbh), and there were interesting character dynamics between most of the cast. It was really looking like it was going to be a great five star anime, but then it happens. Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideAlright, so they have a cool dynamic between the humans and the underground race that lasted up til episode twenty.... What should come next? A fight between them? Diplomacy? Anything? Nah, fuck that. They had below the ground, and on the ground. We need above the ground! Aliens! Yeah aliens, a giant armada, then they turn into a giant robot with tits and save the day. Pardon? What happens to the underground people? Who cares! Honestly the worst waste of potential i can think of.",5
darling-in-the-franxx,"I enjoyed every part of it, It made me happy and It made me sad(in a good way of course), but this is an amazing anime or what you want to call it. I think it changed my life forever and I will remember this show. It made me think that life isn't as bad as I thought. A big thank you to everyone who helped to create this masterpiece. - ArtyXP (Artūrs Kristaps Gubiņš) (edit) - I might start watching more anime and doing other stuff, just because it was that inspirational. Before I watched this anime I had only watched like 10 episodes of other anime's and anime scenes. Before this I had never wanted to watch anime, but thanks for changing that. I would rate everything 10/10. Before I watched the episodes after episode 11, I saw a few comments on Instagram that after episode 16 everything isn't good. I believe that there was not a single problem to this anime.(Also sorry if my grammar is bad or anything.)",4.5
darling-in-the-franxx,"This series really was a roller-coaster experience. At first, it comes off as a straightforward mech anime that really tries very hard to fit in as many innuendos as possible with regard to the duel pilot system. As it continues, though, it smartly moves on from that and really starts to explore the show's central themes, and that's when it blossoms. A love story at its core, it questions the meaning of humanity and what it is that truly makes us human. It stalls out a bit as it approaches its climax (see what I did there?) but ultimately the ending is very poignant and satisfying. The art, animation, mech, and character design are all top-notch, as to be expected from Studio Trigger. This one is well worth sticking with all the way through.",4.5
darling-in-the-franxx,"While Darling in the FranXX is certainly advertised as a mecha show and at times mocked for its ecchi piloting poses.  I found it primarily to be a heart warming love story under the bird cage of an Orwellian society that I will forever remember.  Don't get me wrong the mecha action was thrilling, but the real icing of the cake is the tender and tumultuous moments of the teen protagonists dabbling with love. As someone so tired of the romance story cliches that roll the finale credits mere moments after protagonists become an offical couple at the absolute end... I find the opposite direction of this show so refreshing and memorial.   This show really fleshes out the romance story for us to see in entirety to the point where tender kisses, hugs, and shoulder leanings become more fan-service then the cliche ecchi moments.  As corny as it sounds I am always moved to tears by the wholesome life affirming love depicted in this anime and shows don't usually make break down with tears.  However this Darling in the Franxx was such a sweat treat that melted my heart. I am really looking forward to passing this gem down forever to teen relatives and children as one of the best stories of ever lasting love created so far.",5
darling-in-the-franxx,"This anime is by far the best anime I have seen (In my opinion so don't hate me)100/10 will watch again.Pros:Strong start of seriesVery Emotional (Made me cry{This is the first time in my life I have cried because of a program/video/cartoon/anime or book})Good Character Design (Except Strelizia True Apus which is just Zero Two's face) (Strelizia is quite well designed)Has some real myths applied to it (Like the Jian)Nice SFX and Special EffectsGood Development (Episode 21 was okay, after that it was meh.)Hooks you to watch the next Episode immediatlyCons:Episode 22 , 23 and 24 had messed up a bit but, I enjoyed Hiro and Zero Two's last moments along with what followed.NOT ENOUGH CONTEXT Spoiler Alert!

darling-in-the-franxx,"The story starts out great. Good depth and enticing it keeps you wanting to see if Zero Two and Hiro can connect. The mech battles are fun to watch but lack real devotion. Other mecha shows will satisfy you more if that is why you are here. After episode 15 the show takes a left turn and seems like it goes down the wrong path. The end is definitely... different, but there is still satisfaction in the conclusion if you make it there. I don't believe the show deserves the hype but it is still worth viewing if you don't have other shows lined up. 3 out of 5",5
darling-in-the-franxx,"Could've been a 5/5. Darling is funny, has great character interaction without lacking on mech fighting (even though mechs having facial expressions just seems weird to me) and showed great potential. However the plot stopped making sense whatsoever, and the ending was just on a whole different scope than the rest of the series. It felt rushed and quite honestly ruined the series for me. Still an interesting watch.",5
darling-in-the-franxx,"Positives:Past the first couple of episodes you realize that it isn't going to be like Kill la Kill where the humor and plot was entirely around skimpy clothes and nudity. Theres a reason for the sexual innuendo, and Zero Two is really the only one who bares much at all. They even have a beach episode in which everyone was in nice modest swimsuits for once, and it actually had plot.If you don't like mech anime then you will be satisfied with this show because it focuses more on the relationships of the pilots rather than just the robots. It helps that the Robots look more humanoid than mechanical. There is also a whole metaphor to the boy/girl pair pilots. It has to do with stable relationships. Others explain it much better.The animation can be really great at times but it is noticeable when the quality drops. Refer to the whole meme that was created from the scene where Zero Two and Hiro reunite. That could have been a touching moment if their faces hadn't moved like muppets. Zero Two looked like a completely different character in that moment. I guess this is the perfect segway to the cons.Cons:Where to start with this show. I've seen the entire series and I have to at least start with pacing.3/4ths of this show has just the right speed for introducing characters, ""lore"", and getting you interested about just what the heck is going on behind the scenes. Like why do these kids know nothing about basic intimacy and the concept of love? All this sexual stuff is forced onto them (piloting positions anyone) and they don't catch the innuendo at all? And where are the adults (until the episode that lets you see a little bit of how they live). Then BAM. Last few episodes of the series are crazy info dumps and stupid plot twists just when you thought things were about to make sense. This series could have done with two seasons to keep things well thought out, but it got so rushed that I just couldn't enjoy the ending. Further detailed below, but spoilers.Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideThe writing. These kids were so open about their defiance and the people that make up ""Papa"" were just like ""lol k"". I was expecting the kids would find out they were going to all be killed off after their usefulness expired and would turn around and fight the system or whatever afterwards. They'd run away with their mechs, find out about/meet the klaxxosaur queen and she'd reveal to them that ""Papa"" and their society has been using their life energy to power everything in the first place, and then they'd fight alongside the klaxxosaurs to reclaim earth, and go back to a clean way of living w/o using magma energy. It would have made a lot more sense than the whole aliens plot twist, making the team pretty much go ""I believe in fairies, I do I do I do"" to revive Hiro, and Zero Two and Hiro could have maybe had a happy ending instead of dying in an attempt to fertilize their bomb egg way out in space. I am not kidding. If you missed that symbolism, you might be blind, because that whole sequence was filled with sex lines that bashed you over the head. The hive mind boss didn't even get defeated. It is still out there.The way they handled Zero Two and Hiro. After they realized they were each other's darlings via flashback, Zero Two lost everything about her that made her interesting. She does a complete 180 and loses her personality. I mean, she still has one, its just she gets along with everyone now and is just generally bubbly and cute, and all she does is have cute moments with Hiro. While this was still good, she just felt like a completely different character and only shows her old mischievous side in one scene for like a split second. Zero Two MADE the couple work and after she got boring, the entire relationship got boring. It makes you feel like Kokoro and Mitsuru stole the spotlight of the whole series by being a much more interesting and dynamic couple. And they actually got to do it and have a child. That was the most beautiful birth scene I have ever seen by the way, and pretty brave for an anime.",5
darling-in-the-franxx,"At the start of this anime, I was a bit like what the heck and raised my brow quite a few times. I honestly didn't think I'd like it as much as I did at the end and didn't think it would live up to all the hype. But after around episode 11, it really started picking up for me and I couldn't put it down. I found myself really enjoying each episode and racing to finish it and see how everything unfolded. It did pass my expectations as a whole and I found myself crying at the end. I went from hating to falling in love with Zero Two as a character as well, and to say it again, I am fond of each character and the show. Please do watch this, it'll make you think about a lot of things differently about our world and I promise it will exceed your expectations and leave you feeling satisfied.",5
darling-in-the-franxx,"What I liked:- Good animation quality- Pretty likable, interesting characters, including both the main 2 characters as well as all the others in the ""squad 13""- Good story progression with good intrigue which keeps you wondering WTF is going on with the world in the show and what will happen with it next, at least until the last couple of episodes- Great soundtrack, especially the intro song- Romance stuff. I like seeing it in any anime, and this one has plenty of it, without going overboard. Well, aside from the sexualized ""riding positions"" in the Franxx, but that's not really as bad or ""lewd"" as some people think since the characters themselves don't even think of those positions as something sexual and they don't even know how to have sex until much, much later.What I didn't like:- the last 2 episodes went really, REALLY overboard with some irrational, ""werid-for-the-sake-of-being-weird"" stuff, including the main villains basically saying Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hide""whatever you did was totally pointless, you cannot defeat us and we will be back"" as well as the 2 main characters/protagonists who pointlessly sacrificed themselves, but supposedly become reincarnated in different bodies much later, most likely without any previous memories ... This basically killed off most of the enjoyment I had from all the previous episodes. Oh well, at least I didn't waste any money on it (and I definitely won't be spending any on any merchandise related to this show).",5
darling-in-the-franxx,"When I first started this show, I have to say that it was one of my favorites. The relationships in this show were beautifully written and presented to the audience, and the plot of the story was slowly revealing itself to us, but ever since the second half of the anime began (aka the Doctor Franxx flashback episode), the story was really going downhill from there. I felt like Trigger was also trying to do this Kill La Kill thing where they give you a really slow story only to throw this really insane plot twist in your face, making the situation for our protagonist more dire. Except, in this instance, it didn't work at all. There was a lot more telling in this show than showing (especialy with the Doctor Franxx episode), and even if we wanted something explained to us like Hiro's sudden klaux. transformation, that is never explained to us or shown how that has happened. We can only speculate that somehow the blood he licked  corrupted his DNA or whatever. Even the plot twist that Trigger gives you is eventually swept under the rug to focus mainly on the more boring story of Earth recovering, which isn't really exciting. A lot of potential story that could have been written for the war against VIRM isn't shown at all, and is mainly overshadowed by overly pretty art to hide the fact that they basically did not develop this half of the story enough. And while I deeply LOVE the relationship between Hiro and Zero Two (I think it's one of the most touching), there's nothing really new that they do with it that makes my love for these two go that extra step. The way they solve the final conflict between VIRM and Hiro/Zero Two is by basically making Zero Two  unrealistically  contact this little girl that was born literally two years ago -- that she never met -- and somehow have the gang know that somethings wrong and that they need to do a magic prayer circle in order to save them. Like.... WHAT? I'm sorry but even in the world that this story takes place, that does not make any sense whatsoever. While I'm happy that this story ended on a happy note, the path there was not a good one, and I'm disappointed that I have to give this show an overall rating of 3.",5
darling-in-the-franxx,"This anime is one of the best I have ever watched, simply put, its AMAZING. At times it may be a bit rushed but the story and everything about it really is just something else, it sure took the number 1 spot in my list. I just finished watching the very last episode of the anime and I honestly wish there was more.If your looking for a good anime to watch then go straight ahead because it's definitely worth the watch.I Hope there is a season 2 with a Future storyline...Genres: Action, Drama, Mecha, Romance, Sci-Fi",5
darling-in-the-franxx,"Honestly though... She is just bae, one of my favorite anime heroines to date. The storyline really drew me in as well, its a take on the age old question of what would happen if we did achieve immortality, and albeit some aspects of the anime are unrealistic, that's not to be expected, if you came for realism, try somewhere else. I really enjoyed watching this series, and I can't wait to see what more is to come from it. Definitely on my top anime list, and I recommended it to all my friends, to which they've gotten back to me and also liked it a lot. :DD",5
darling-in-the-franxx,"The writing in this show just blew my mind.Initially, I thought it was funny to have a doggy-style position system to operate the mechs which I can understand why people would not take this show seriously. But looking beyond that, you get to get attached to the characters in this show and understand why the mechs needed a female and male to operate them and not just because it is metaphor. And as the title of my review implies, it is more then just kids controlling giant mechs to destroy monsters. This is where Studio Trigger really shines..the plot twists. S**t does get real!",4.5
darling-in-the-franxx,"At first I was very skeptical for obvious reasons but once I got past my initial judgments of the outlandish visuals, I was able to recognize the stories true depth. The creator does in immaculate job as far as world building is concerned but I can see how many people overlook all the small details. Each episode raises many questions and you aren't presented with clear answers for quite some time. The story is put forth in such a way that really requires you to read in between the lines and it my opinion, that's what makes it so captivating. It creates an atmosphere of deep conflict and in between are some stunning visuals and fight scenes. It is not without faults but it is expertly written and worth the watch.",4.5
darling-in-the-franxx,"At first sight it might seem as if this was an ecchi anime, with all the weird pilot positions, BUT THAT'S JUST A FILTER, TO WEED OUT THE WEAK, for only the THOSE OF TRUE FAITH may truly enjoy this masterpiece that Trigger and A-1 Studios have brought upon this world~Character development gets a solid 9, animation style triggers some nostalgia related to Kill la Kill, Gurren Lagann, classic Trigger stuff~Even if you are not  a mecha fan, you are gonna love this show.The facial expressions of these mechas gets a 10, so cute.  Top anime 2k18 candidate.",3
darling-in-the-franxx,"I'm giving it four stars because I don't think it deserves five but I don't necessarily think it deserves a three star rating either.Things I like about Darling in the Franxx:- The art is beautiful- The animation is stellar- Some of the episodes are really really goodThings I have a problem with about Darling in the Franxx:- Most of the characters are pretty basic (you can basically identify each character's personality from the poster and they don't change much)- The way it's organized feels like it gets in the way of the story- There's a too much time spent covering the same issuesFrom episode one you get introduced to the issue that Hiro's life is in danger if he pilots a franxx with Zero Two. Eventually that problem gets resolved. Or so we were led to believe. Suddenly, there's a new problem they hadn't considered that again puts him in danger of piloting the franxx with Zero Two. I'm not saying it should be taken out of the story, but I don't see the purpose of emphasizing his ability to suddenly pilot a Franxx with Zero Two if he's just going to be in the same position again in a couple episodes. In the middle of this plot line various conflicts occur between the other parasites which seem like a big deal until something new happens with Hiro and Zero Two. This causes those problems to get shelved until the next time there is space. A.K.A. when something isn't happening with Zero Two and Hiro. This makes it feel like a large amount of the show is filler, especially when conflicts suddenly get resolved with very little explanation or effort Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hide(the broken promise between Mitsuru and Hiro, Ichigo taking Hiro to Zero Two in episode 15). That being said, some of the Hiro and Zero Two stuff is really awesome and it's not like watching an anime that isn't always grabbing your attention is going to kill you. This show is definitely worth a watch and I would really like to know how other people feel about this show because I'm kind of lost in my opinion of it.",5
darling-in-the-franxx,"I'm not kidding, the memes are funny but without a premium account, the memes will spoil everything. If you plan on binge watching this later,  DON'T GO TO r/Animemes!!. For those people who live under a rock, r/Animemes is a subreddit on reddit. Now to the actual review. This show is really good at character development. I feel like this anime is just kind of a slice of life with mecha thrown in, But that doesn't mean the anime doesn't have good mecha battles. I'll try not to spoil some stuff but I really enjoy the battles between Strelizia and the klaxosuars. I don't really know what to write in this review except for not to go onto r/Animemes.",4
darling-in-the-franxx,"Too be honest, this has to be one of the first anime(s) of all to get me started to watching other genres of anime. This one is the pinnacle and ever since seeing this anime I have strived to watch others.Example; Beat-less,Heavy Object,Clockwork Planet, Etc & etc..I hope the Creator(s) of Darling in the FRANXX strive to continue this series as it's one of a kind of anime that many other Creator(s) cannot do. You have my good luck and thank-you for making such an unbelievable series. Thank-you, thank-you so damn much!",4
darling-in-the-franxx,"At first glance, DARLING in the FRANXX appears to be a trope-filled anime with tons of fan service. But this fan service has a REASON to exist - and that is where DARLING in the FRANXX shines most - in its slow, methodical and beautiful introduction to the world that our heros, Hiro and Zero Two live in.I am NOT a fan of fan service and I was extremely put off by the odd sexual innuendos indicated by how the FRANXX (the giant mechs) are piloted but as the story begins to unveil discrepancies such as these kids not knowing what any type of affection is - it becomes clear that the tropes that exist start to make sense. These are kids who know no intimacy, no kisses, no education of emotions and love and it is almost an anomaly as to why.It's this type of deep, rooted ideologies in DARLING in the FRANXX that made it stand out to me. I am thoroughly excited to learn more about this world and have begun to understand its intricacies with relationships and how complex they can be.",5
darling-in-the-franxx,"Thus far the series, to me, is quite compelling and full of personalities.  Being told nothing of Love, growing up, and having 'Partners' of the opposite sex, creates a wonder of how love could grow.  The squad and their interconnections, resembling a class of young high school students; a 'transfer student' of an older age (who may not be human at all) arrives knowing more about the world, and seemingly of relationships between people, and nature.  Throw in another squad that knows the world in a different sense, and knows of 002 and 016, and you have an interesting construction of what it is growing up and understanding the world.  Let alone being told you are the youngsters who are to save the world. As what looks like love triangles build, and life is threatened, I am very much looking forward to seeing how the future of the series unfolds, and the growth of the characters.  It makes me think of something that a mixture of Eva and Gurren Lagann could yield.  Bonus, I love Studio Trigger.",3
darling-in-the-franxx,"Back when the anime first came out earlier this year I gave it a low rating due to having some overly predictable story but as I stuck around it got better!The story in a nutshell: Kids are paired together to fight in mechs that can only truly function if they're subconsciously compatible with one another. They all serve to protect a bubbled off city that is prone to mech monster alien attacks.Personally, the cast is your typical run-of-mill predictable characters like the kid that eats a lot, the tsundere, the punk brat rival you want to punch in the face, smart glasses guy, etc. The only good one is Zero two; rebellious, unfiltered, ambitious. Her dynamic with the protagonist Hiro works well enough to make the anime alright at best. However! As the anime continues into the double digits character, plot, and story kicks up a notch! You get a much better view of what's going on and why things are the way they are both characters and world alike. It anime to me shies away from being a 5/5 due to repetitive problem-solving solutions but all and all the anime was great!",5
darling-in-the-franxx,This anime couldn't trigger me until the episode 4. This reminds me so much on Gundam 00 but yet it is so different. It have original parts of his own. Characters are cool but Zero Two is on another level of personality. I recommend this anime to everyone and I would be sad if for some reason this anime can't see trough the end cause this have massive potential to become my #1 anime if my expectations are made.,5
darling-in-the-franxx,"Heavy on the sexual metaphors...that's no problem. I think they crouch the language/story into those terms to titillate younger audiences. But, this is more akin to a robot marriage...anime style. It's still very much enjoyable so far; perhaps I'm waiting to see how close the studio can push the limits? What lurks in the minds of these characters (writers/artists)?I'm also sure the series will spark discussions about teenage/adolescent sexuality, but this will reflect basically the social mores that each viewer brings from their culture. However, I believe the show has the controlling metaphors down pat; eg. the ""papa"" and the council. Who/what could they represent? And the young girl that's a demon? It's not hard to figure out.",5
is-it-wrong-to-try-to-pick-up-girls-in-a-dungeon,"Sort of has the same feel as shows like SAO or Log Horizon, though without the meta story running in the background, which to me is a good thing. I never cared much for when the ""real world"" stuff pored to much into those shows. I'll be perfectly honest and say the title of this show drew me into it, but really got hooked by this first episode. The voice work and the characters were really well done in my opinion, and the animation is pretty solid. I probably would of watched this show anyways just for the pretense that the title creates but now having seen it I will be waiting more than a little impatiently each week for the new episode! Much love.",4.5
is-it-wrong-to-try-to-pick-up-girls-in-a-dungeon,"This somehow manages to be fun, intriguing, titillating, and exciting.While it's not a carbon copy of the manga,It appears some good choices where made when adapting this to the big screen. It's still early on, but I haven't had this much fun with a series in a long time.Update: Episode 8  was one of the most satisfying and best directed fight scenes I've ever seen. Period.... In regular movies and anime alike... I came to tears by the time it ended. Director Yoshiki Yamakawa may have raised the bar a bit with this one.The Remaining 5 episodes have a tough act to follow.",5
is-it-wrong-to-try-to-pick-up-girls-in-a-dungeon,It initially reminds me of Tower of Druaga. Action/comedy DnD that seems as if it may have some harem tendencies but it's to soon to tell. You have the MC who is he'll bent on getting stronger which is pretty par for this type of anime. It's just fun to watch and it he animation is easy on the eyes. Mild fan service. Different Familias will obviously provide plenty of antagonists so there should be a solid and diverse group of characters that will move the story along. Really interested to see where this goes regarding the leveling system and dungeon.,5
is-it-wrong-to-try-to-pick-up-girls-in-a-dungeon,"Let's admit it, the title and/or cover art of the anime managed to pique our interest! As a humongous lover of Sword Art Online, Log Horizon, No Game No Life, and gaming personally, it's easy for me to envelop myself in a world that revolves around adventurers, gaming, and goddesses.The idea of ""needing to get stronger for a stranger to fall for me"" could have definitely been pulled off better. However, the animation was fluid, artwork was well detailed, and music seems to entertain my interest throughout the show! The little bits of comedy and action were definitely what made this show MORE than worth watching again. Overall, I'd personally give it a 4.5/5 and suggest either putting this show on your queue or watching it RIGHT NOW!",5

This is one of the few anime out there that integrates mythology (Greek Gods in this case) into the story. Aside from this, there is also the storyline. Sure people are going to claim ""No its just boobs"" or ""Just another Harem"", but don't forget that Bell is strictly trying to get together with Aiz and everything he has done up to this point is towards that goal. This anime is exceptionally well crafted and can become even more amazing than it is already.EDIT: THE TITLE IS CALLED ""Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?"". ITS GONNA HAVE HAREM FFS.",5
is-it-wrong-to-try-to-pick-up-girls-in-a-dungeon,"The first season was fantastic, truly amazing.  This second season is a bitter disappointment.  I understand that you can't easily put everything contained in the books into an alternate media such as anime.  However, the pacing on this is FAR too aggressive which makes the final product choppy and altogether too compressed. It leaves the story flavorless and uninformed and the battle scenes were decidedly underwhelming when compared to the grandeur described in the light novels.  This is still a favorite series of mine but so far I have been unable to bring myself to continue watching past the wholly unsatisfying episode 4.",5
is-it-wrong-to-try-to-pick-up-girls-in-a-dungeon,Since i saw this anime on LiveChart i had a certain feeling this would be something completely different and enjoyable to watch.I found the story plot to be a twist with Sao for the reason being of dungeons. Sadly Sao got boring half way because of the all berserk healer Asuna love story plot. On the other hand this gave away the feel of an aspiring adventure and a twisted love story between more then one female. Id rate this anime a 10/10 for surpassing my own expectationsGood luck with the chicks Bell Cranel my friend.,5
is-it-wrong-to-try-to-pick-up-girls-in-a-dungeon,"This show is spectacular!!! Now i know that in itself isnt a very good opening statement, but it truly describes this show. It is waaaaay better than i thought it was going to be tbh. The action scenes...oh my the action scenes... they show amazing potential, granted it is the beginning of the series so they havent gotten too crazy just yet but it is easy to see how good the action is going to be. The plot, well it is really nice but nothing we havent seen before (in a sense). However the characters are soo well thought out and unique imo and I really see this show being VERY popular soon!! The animation is sickkk as well (in a good way lol) really crisp, clear and smooth and flow really well. I wont be surprised if this show ends up being as popular or (at least almost) as sword art. Imho it started out better than sword art and Bell - Kun  is JUST as awesome as Kirito - Kun  ;]   So all in all this is a great show an would recommend it to all anime fans!!! Enjoy! PS... the fan service isnt bad either :p",5
is-it-wrong-to-try-to-pick-up-girls-in-a-dungeon,"Season 2 is some of the worst anime Ive ever seen in my life. The main character is now, all of a sudden for now reason completely useless. Hes worse than when he was saved all the way back in season 1 episode 1. His strength, training, adversities all mean nothing now. Lvl 3, S class stats all maxed... Nope means ZERO. Every random smuck just handles him with complete ease. He also cant take action at all.now. just doesnt. The two times he does, 1st time they make an extremely underwhelming, crappily animated fight. 2nd time he just runs aeound screamong firebolt till some guy in lingerie instantly tackles him to the ground and pins him down. Makes literally ZERO fucking sense. Like holy fuck this show has gone to shit.",2
is-it-wrong-to-try-to-pick-up-girls-in-a-dungeon,i wish there was a way to separate the reviews but to put it bluntly season 1 is a five star show and season 2 is a garbage tier anime. i almost never write a review for a show but ive never seen such a drastic drop in the quality of the story telling from one season to the next. the first season had its cliche harem fantasy aspects but put significant effort into character strengthening only to have him immediately revert to being useless for no reason in season 2 just to boost his strength again.,5
is-it-wrong-to-try-to-pick-up-girls-in-a-dungeon,"When i started watching the first episode i instantly recognized the voice actor of Kirito fro SAO. This show definitely has a little SAO feel to it while watching the first episode. But i feel it will be amazing in its own right. The artwork, characters and voices that go along with them are amazing. This show has potential to be good. It kept me wanting another after the credits and stuff was done. I am looking forward to watching this series and glad crunchyroll picked it up. Final thoughts: The show couldnt have been better. As i stated before it felt like SAO when i started watching it but now that ive finished it moved so far away from SAO it became a greater show instead. The characters and voice acting were great. The ending was good in my opinion. I cant wait to see if this show gets picked up for another season of maybe some OVAs. I hope you enjoy this show too",4.5
is-it-wrong-to-try-to-pick-up-girls-in-a-dungeon,"What we loved from the first season, has now diverted from the growth and character-building formula. Bells character was still in this growth phase when season 1 ended.However, Season 2 took a slower pace or nonexistence growth phase, it does show some tid-bits of training but non that actually develops him as a character or the struggle he has to go through to attain higher strength.It is far from its glory days in season one, where we were always eager to know what states or skills or how he has grown in season one. The fighting is lacking, as it doesn’t show the same struggle and tension that the first season had. He doesn’t seem to have grown at all, and we are at episode 9. There have been too many side character and side arcs based on the formula of how he can talk his way out of situation, which you end up not caring about the side characters in the end. Bell is basically useless and indecisive and wont action until he cries about it first, this is backwards character building compared to the first season. Season one, Bell always did something about things that bothered him and although knew he was weak sought to grow stronger, hence the special skill he has in regards to striving to become stronger.I probably wait till the network decides to proceed to a more complex and character-building arc, it just feels like this is cannon fodder.",4.5
is-it-wrong-to-try-to-pick-up-girls-in-a-dungeon,"Rating Summary Composite Rating 4/5Very very solid anime. I would recommend it to people who are fans of pretty much any genre since it has a lot which will appeal to many different demographics. The characters are very likeable for the most part and the main character is not OP as hell so you feel tense watching some of the battles. I wouldn't say this is a ""must watch"" which is why it does not get 5 stars; however, it is a very good anime that i would have no problem recommending to anyone.SynopsisBell, a new adventurer, is tasked with fighting in a dungeon in order to gain money, and become stronger through leveling up. Additionally, he has to balance multiple love interests (If hestia will let him that is).Plot: 4/5Typical rom-com/harem anime with an oblivious main character and several girls that seem to show very obvious affection. Has all of the tropes including, jealous main female, loli love interest, aloof love interest, and bromance. (3)This formula is combined with the typical RPG like anime that has become popular as of late.(+1) If you liked SAO/Log Horizon, you would probably like this anime.Characters: 4/5Bell, the main character is basically like a white haired kirito. Plays alone for a while, however is very kind to his allies, and people in general. His kindness can be seen as a strength or a weakness.Hestia is a main love interest who cares very much for bell. The two have great chemistry, and i hope to see their relationship develop more should there be a second season.Liliruca is arguably the most defined character in the entire series. She is plagued by a dark backstory which drives many of her early decisions.Aiz is a seemingly aloof, yet caring main love interest. It is unclear why she takes an interest to bell, however the dynamic between the two is very sweet.Animation/Design: 5/5This anime has a color pallete which is easy on the eyes, as well as pleasant arty style. There is a good amount of attention to detail and the ""special effects"" are pretty cool. It reminded me a lot of Log-horizon.Audio/Soundtrack: 3/5Good, but only that. There was nothing bad, and nothing that really stood out. I will not comment on the OP or ED since i pretty much only watch those once and then skip them forever after. Average soundtrack gets an average score from me.",5
is-it-wrong-to-try-to-pick-up-girls-in-a-dungeon,"I thought this would be something fresh due to the obviously unique title. Although a little disappointed that this has a huge SAO feel to it I gradually started to like it more and more. The pace of the show feels slow (in a good way) and relatively well explained even though, the main character is advancing at such a fast pace. To conclude, this is a better version of SAO essentially, except without the virtual reality part of the show, and much better pacing character development is better than SAO. I thoroughly enjoyed the show thus far.",1
is-it-wrong-to-try-to-pick-up-girls-in-a-dungeon,"Even though I never liked SAO, I really like this show! It's really awesome so far (up to Episode 3) and I can't wait for more... The Setting is very intriguing with its combination of mythological, comical, romantic, fantasy & arcade/MMO elements without it being too silly or too cheesy for my taste.However it was it's plot which really drew me in, as it is very immersing and has so much potential.",1
is-it-wrong-to-try-to-pick-up-girls-in-a-dungeon,"I must say that I'm thrilled to watch this anime! I'm very much into OL game style of anime (Log Horizon, SAO, No Game No Life...) and although it is similar, it has its unique qualities. The basis of this anime is that certain people have gods who have lost some of their power, but the humans still have to ""level up"" and gain experience to increase in skill. The gods are also capable of reading members of their ""familia's"" skill level and recording their progress. It has all of the perks of a video game-style of anime but without having to explain how people are trapped in another world. I'm very excited to continue watching this anime and know that after two episodes there is much more intrigue and action to come.",5
is-it-wrong-to-try-to-pick-up-girls-in-a-dungeon,"I have only seen the first episode as that is all that has come out for this show, but I already love it. The animation and art are both great and the story will have lots of room to grow and expand. As some others said this is similar to that of SAO or Log Horizon. But it more so has the feel and comedy of Log Horizon with the emotional and romantic aspect of SAO.Overall If you are looking for a great show to watch I would recommend this one as if it continues to deliver like the first episode this could be a great series, that could last a long time.",2
is-it-wrong-to-try-to-pick-up-girls-in-a-dungeon,"Just like so many have already said ill finish their thoughts for them.  The First Season is a golden Mana flowing from the heavens not to be missed.The second season is what I would call a steaming pile of runoff, composed of compacted horse excrement. Now dont get me wrong season 2 as a standalone anime would be fine. I would probably enjoy it on its own. The main problem being of coarse, the new season leaves its base. Becoming something new and deformed from the original. Anyway I feel the 2rd season was more of an afterthought or money maker than a true continuation or completion of the story.with all that said i can only hope a season 3 is made and they go back too the 1st formula that made season 1 so great.",1
is-it-wrong-to-try-to-pick-up-girls-in-a-dungeon,"Ok, stop right now. If the reason you are not watching this anime is because it's, ""a harem,"" anime, then I beg you give this anime a shot. Yes, it has a trope of most females introduced having an interest in the main character, but it's not really that bad. The hero is likeable, his main goal is to be a hero, save the girl, get a wife, and go on adventures. He isn't trying to assemble a harem, and that's what makes this enjoyable. The action is awesome, Hestia is adorable, and Bell is not a pervert, which makes this really enjoyable to watch.",5
is-it-wrong-to-try-to-pick-up-girls-in-a-dungeon,"The title of this anime actually turned me away from watching this at first.Giving the first episode a chance, was caught completely by surprise.Fun with an interesting story line and characters.At first it seemed very light hearted, but by the end of the first episode, you had the feeling of some depth, and you just like the main character(s).At least by the writing of the review, there is a mysterious back story developing that our characters are growing into nicely, where we can root for them to grow and succeed.Very enjoyable and worth a thumbs up review.",4
is-it-wrong-to-try-to-pick-up-girls-in-a-dungeon,"I have been watching anime for over 15 years now, and over 200+ shows and movies.  This is quickly making it to my top 10 of all time.  Fujino Ōmori has created an amazing balance between Drama and action with character development that quickly gains your buy in to the main characters.The majority of animes now are great ideas that have not been fleshed out past 4 or 5 episodes.  That result in either all action with no story or tons of fan service to sidetrack you from the fact there is no story.  Fujino has found the formula that works it keeps you on the edge of your seat at times, and will have you emotionally moved at others all packed into 25 minutes.I would highly recommend give this show a watch, and see what this new author has done.  For being his debut manga I cannot wait to see what else is in store for this and any future endeavors he may have.  If he continues on this path I would expect many more great things!",5

This show is very casual, and i love it",5
is-it-wrong-to-try-to-pick-up-girls-in-a-dungeon,"On the surface, this looks like a show that would be very ecchi, loaded with fanservice, and I am not a fan of shows where fanservice takes precedence over story/character development, I find it annoying, unnecessary, cheap.Now I'm not a detractor of fanservice, in moderation it's fine, and this show actually balances it out quite nicely. It's not in your face every 5 seconds with sleazy camera angles distracting you from the story. So if you're going to have fanservice in a show, this is how you do it, with good characters, an interesting story that keeps you coming back for more, and it doesn't hurt to have some great animation too.Also, some people are comparing this to SAO and Log Horizon, and while all three have that fantasy RPG element, Is it Wrong to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon is set a fantasy world, where as the other 2 are set in MMORPG game worlds, and to me thus far there is no connection beyond the fantasy elements.",4.5

But I have read ahead with the Light Novels (currently finished Book 11), and I will say the story moving forward from the end of the anime is leagues above and beyond what I felt from these 12 episodes. If you read books or Manga. Give this series ago.PS: It still isn't an Isekai show.As the title says, on episode twelve when writing this review and it's great, but not perfect. The main character in the beginning was a weakling getting saved left and right, and he still is currently but he is slowly becoming ""overpowered"". This is good since in anime with the RPG feel to it, SAO rings a bell, the main characters are usually OP as can be from the start.On that note this is a anime based on an RPG that ISN'T a video game. Or at least they don't give the vibe that it is. No talk about real world, logging out, friends list etc etc.This Anime is a must watch in my books. even if you prefer anime of macho manly characters who know it all, it is still worth watching. Watch Bell-kun become strong to protect the ones he cares about; and have an actual struggle to do so.",2

This anime just might be one of the best fantasy anime I've seen. This anime has an amazing plot and story of how the magical things in the world where the characters are living.

Which is how I see them from my own perspective in an actual RPG (or in some RPG's I would have liked to have seen them shown and used like that). also the stats as morphing (magical) tattoos on the characters backs is a great concept I liked that idea. as well as showing his improvement in certain stats, such as in his agility and maneuvering in the latest episodes on the 11th floor of the dungeon was great. especially liking his hero mentality which is how I go into RPG's in my own mindset, so its nice to see the character have that same mentality.Anyway thanks for the show!!

But I was so wrong.This anime is everything that I was looking for. It is very similar to the first arc of SAO (which was the best part of SAO) and has many epic fight scenes already (currently on episode 9). The protagonist is great and interesting along with the other characters in the show. The character development is good, the storyline is currently good, the pace of the anime is good, the art of the anime is good. Everything about it is great so far.

I enjoy that this story/anime doesn't have its characters ""play"" a game.",5
is-it-wrong-to-try-to-pick-up-girls-in-a-dungeon,"This one is definitely worth the time. The pacing is perfect, not too fast, not to slow, and just the right amount of character development throughout. Indeed, this is anime quite a treat! The story so far has been emotional, humorous, captivating, kinda pervy but not so much that it rouses any disturbing thoughts. . .ANYWAY... This is my first review of any anime and it's solely because i think ""Anime name too long"" is worth the time to write one. I really hope it continues to a second season although with it's popularity I wouldn't be too surprised if plans are already in the works!(This is me wishfully thinking).",4
is-it-wrong-to-try-to-pick-up-girls-in-a-dungeon,"Now i have had my crunchyroll roll account for along time now. I have never wrote a review before. This show actually made me feel like i had to tell everyone about it. Again very similar to Log Horizon, or SOA. But this time there is ""real-world"" and the virtual world. This time it cuts all that out and just focuses on the lore and story of one character Bell which is trying to become a hero. Due to his kind heart and determination he gets friends which help him along the way. The fact that this anime only has 9 episodes so far from when im writing and you feel so attached to the character, like he is something everyone wants to be. The ""Little-Rookie"" with big dreams. The only thing bad i can say is, after every episode it kills me the fact i got to wait a week to watch another episode.",4
is-it-wrong-to-try-to-pick-up-girls-in-a-dungeon,"I have never really written reviews about shows. But omg, this particular anime forced me to write a review and talk about the show. First of all, the title might draw some people away and some people close to it. But don't judge the book by its cover. It is a beautiful anime with a beautiful story, that will get you hooked from Day 1. I have become more and more impatient every week for each episode, as it is getting more and more intense every time. Im going to be straight with everyone, it is MUST WATCH SHOW!!",5
is-it-wrong-to-try-to-pick-up-girls-in-a-dungeon,"The title is very misleading, as the MC has his eyes set on only one girl, thus this is not a harem as many indicate. This is a story about a boy who with determination will make his wishes come true and inspire those around him. It is a great and FUNNY story that can be enjoyed by all with different tastes in anime. The setting is based similar to the old AD&D system (i.e.dungeons, leveling, exp etc) except guild/clans are run by gods. The ecchi is almost nonexistant, to the point it is easily overlooked due to such a great story/plot. I hope this will become a very long running anime as it has a lot to offer, story and plot wise similar to Fairy Tale and Naruto. I hope we get to see Bell Grow up into a fine young man.....and above all else, you will come to love Hestia. Watch for pure fun.",2
is-it-wrong-to-try-to-pick-up-girls-in-a-dungeon,"I'll be honest, when I saw the art cover and the name, I set my expectations pretty low. I couldn't have been more wrong. I've waited for half a dozen episodes now to write this review, since I wanted to make sure it would be an accurate look at the anime. The annoying ecchi and harem aspects of the show are so minimal that you forget about them. The art, especially during the big fight scenes, is amazing. The character designs seemed really simple at first, but have grown on me, sometimes simple doesn't have to be bad. The characters are developing with the story in every way I could hope.You will not be disappointed. I know I'm not. Hopefully this review helps clear up some of those things if they are holding you back, as they almost did me.",2
is-it-wrong-to-try-to-pick-up-girls-in-a-dungeon,"From the beginning i thought when i read the name ""why should i watch this? i mean who names their anime  'is it wrong to try to pick up girls in a dungeon'?. "" I left the Crunchy-roll page for this and then looked thru my options again because i was running low on things i was interested in. so i re-read the summary and i decided why not.. it cant hurt right? So, i start watching and about 15 mins in im hooked. next thing i know i look over at the episode list and its only a 1 episode. (-.-)   Then i gave a huge darth vader NUUUUUUUUU!!!!!! and waited every week for this anime. Now i bought all the books and im waiting for the next episode. XP this anime is amazing!!!! 10/10 - IGN",5
is-it-wrong-to-try-to-pick-up-girls-in-a-dungeon,"So you wanna know if this is the typical harem anime with giant boobs and completely subservient girls... I can't think of a way to say no so strongly that it sounds like Zeus came down and yelled it in your face, so you think of one. Anyway, the characters are awesome and (most) have convincing back stories/personalities that match what their experiences have been. The main character Bell is an ""adventurer"" or a person blessed by a god to allow them to fight monsters in a giant tower dungeon. His is Hestia, a fairly weak and unimportant goddess (the black haired girl with the weird ribbon), who is very protective of him. He gets trapped by a much stronger monster in the dungeon and is saved by his main love interest, inspiring him to become stronger. Then we have six episodes of some of the most badass character building I have ever seen. Throughout the time Bell is getting stronger, but it doesn't really sink in until the eighth episode where he has an awesome confrontation. So yeah, freaking watch this and don't let the naysayers dissuade you",5
is-it-wrong-to-try-to-pick-up-girls-in-a-dungeon,"I don't usually write reviews on anime shows at least not here.  This is a show you should just watch, if you like MMO, final fantasy type genre, with boy likes girl, girl(s) like boy, boy chases after the wrong girl, boy learns to launch fireballs at monsters, boy starts to grow-up a bit along way, character development everywhere, a sucker for great mythology, and something to turn your brain off while you watch an anime just watch it.",5

is-it-wrong-to-try-to-pick-up-girls-in-a-dungeon,"NOTE: At the time of this review, only the first 8 episodes of the show have been aired.INTRODUCTION - Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?          To be honest, when I first read the title, I really didn't know what to expect from this show. The ridiculous title hinted at nothing more than a typical harem with a substanceless plot whose sole purpose is to expose more oversized boobies. Yet, the reviews section seemed to suggest otherwise. Out of pure curiosity I decided to dive in and watch the episodes released up to date. Did I make the right call? Hell yes.STORY - Don't judge a book by its cover...          This expression exists for a reason! Don't get me wrong, this anime is by no means a masterpiece, but boy did its qualities take me by surprise. As many other reviewers have mentioned, the plot of this show is in many aspects similar to Sword Art Online: Bell-kun, a timid and young male hero, must level up to reach the upper levels of a tower-like dungeon in order to prove his worth to his love at first sight. In his attempts to accomplish his quest, he never fails to capture the attention of young ladies which all instantly fall in love with him.          If that all sounds to you like a carbon copy of SAO's plot, that's because it actually is. One may even tag the story of this anime as ""unoriginal"". But then, why did I keep watching? You see, this show succeeds in areas where SAO has failed while maintaining many of the latter's qualities. For starters, this show's plot exposition stuck me as remarkably elegant and effortless. Due to the simplicity of the story, this may or may not impress you, but this departure from the plot-heavy anime that always has too much on its plate for its short running time is certainly welcome.CHARACTERS - Brace your spleen, laughter is coming...          While it may be true that many of the characters in this show follow the cookie-cutter model of character design, their colorful and upbeat nature, along with the wonderful humor they share on screen kept me begging for the next episode. The characters of this show are completely ridiculous (borderline insane), but the show embraces their foolishness so well that you'll wonder if some sort of divine force is at work to keep this show together.          There is great chemistry between the two lead characters. The young adventurer Bell-kun and his housewife-like goddess Hestia both make tremendous sacrifices to keep marching forward against the incessant tidal waves of harem fangirls and overpowered Minotaurs. Overall, this character-driven narrative features great character development and a more than decent pacing.ARTWORK - Who said that harem should spawn cheap productions?          I must admit, the quality of the artwork surprised me considered the seemingly light-hearted and simplistic nature of the show. Some of the dungeon fight scenes definitely stand out (I'm looking at you, episode 8...) and the quality of the animation is, at times, downright fantastic. Most notably, the show completely avoids the pitfall of cheap-a** computer animated models (thank God...) and presents a surprisingly good production value throughout given the show's genre and demographic. Thus, if you don't set the bar too high, you should be able to enjoy this show's visuals just fine.SOUNDTRACK - Dat soundtrack...          The soundtrack is probably the aspect of this show that surprises the most. I have received a university-level musical education and still, the beautiful orchestral soundtrack composed by Keiji Inai managed to catch me off guard with its inspired melodies. Some beautiful musical symbolism for Bell-kun's determination was at work during some of the score's finest moments. Unfortunately, I didn't care much for the opening and credit themes which, while good, don't stand out as much as the rest of the soundtrack due to their lack of originality. CONCLUSION - This one will be brief...          Have I not said enough? Go watch this show already!? But in all seriousness, your enjoyment of this show will largely depend on how well you respond to the show's humor and lighthearted tone. Cold hearted nitpickers beware: you might want to skip this one...STORY: 3.9/5.0CHARACTERS:4.3/5.0ARTWORK:4.1/5.0SOUNDTRACK:4.7/5.0---------------------------------------------------------------OVERALL SCORE (NOT AN AVERAGE):4.5/5.0 - Rounded up to five stars.",4.5
is-it-wrong-to-try-to-pick-up-girls-in-a-dungeon,"I came thinking this was going to be just another goofy and cheesy anime. Let me tell you after 8 episodes it is far from goofy and cheesy. This show has excellent action, gorgeous animation, amazing voice acting, and a decent soundtrack. The only complaint I have is how unbelievably stupid Bell can be to romantic advances in the show. It dies down after the first couple of episodes, but it was pretty bad at times.",5
is-it-wrong-to-try-to-pick-up-girls-in-a-dungeon,"Wow, in honor of this shows brilliant simplicity and immersive story I'm actually writing this one a review...seriously this makes my Fridays so much better. Top show for me this season period.                                                                                                                                If you haven't started watching this show yet then I definitely recommend doing so. Has been worth every second of my time.After watching episode 8: Has literally blown me away, seriously in terms of addiction this show is worse then cigarettes....at least I can go out and have one whenever I want but this I can only have once a week, sweet god let there be second season! The potential is ovER 9000!!!!",5
is-it-wrong-to-try-to-pick-up-girls-in-a-dungeon,"The story and the overall idea behind the story is so good, its like watching a real life 'wow' the bottom line is if you have not seen this show then you do not know what your missing out on. This show involves everything you could want in an anime (without overdoing it), the story so far is catchy to where it will keep me watching (hard to do), voice acting is superb, animations are super solid, the characters and how they interact with one another is also solid, they give just the right amount of boobs and butt too. honestly the fanservice and the story and heck even the title is all bomb diggety lol anyways check this out if you have not already and your thinking about it.",5
is-it-wrong-to-try-to-pick-up-girls-in-a-dungeon,As the title states this is a great anime in my opinion it doesn't need even 10 minutes into the anime to get me hooked its idea isn't all that fresh with shows like SAO out already but it brings a totally fresh feeling with it like its a brand new Idea I actually wish I discovered it later so that there would be more episodes out but this is worth waiting for more an im a very impatient person ill be advising all my friends to watch this anime if they haven't already.    Enjoy everyone,5
is-it-wrong-to-try-to-pick-up-girls-in-a-dungeon,"Read the negative comments to get an idea about the show's pitfalls. Among them was something about it being like SAO, which is mostly untrue. The adventurer mechanics are quite different & varied due to the character and their goddess as well as the familia members. While there are some common tropes within this anime (I want to see your true strength instead of killing you now, etc ...,) it introduces new ideas and philosophies not common to RPG's (especially with the decline in GOOD RPG's.) A colorful cast, simplistic character building and a true focus on Bell, I am impressed with the storyline. Admittedly, I'm disappointed in how rushed the episodes seem vs their 200+ pg manga counterparts. This series has tremendous potential and could have been extended many many more episodes. Still, it's light-hearted, fun and even endearing at times. For people wanting something to lighten the mood and make them feel good, this is definitely a recommendation.",5
is-it-wrong-to-try-to-pick-up-girls-in-a-dungeon,"I was originally looking for an anime similar to Log Horizon and this was a great find. It has an extremely enjoyable story that has enough mystery behind it to keep me excited for the next episode to be released. The action scenes aren't the best as of now, but they show potential for when the show progresses. Also, I don't feel like that is where the show shines. In my opinion, the focus is on what the characters are experiencing, and it's trying to not be another purely action driven show. Although i could go without the ecchi style aspects of the show.",5
is-it-wrong-to-try-to-pick-up-girls-in-a-dungeon,"This anime is literally the coolest version of SAO. In Sao there was only talking and literally no action. This version is amazing and I only watched 4 episodes. I highly recommend this anime if you love action, gods, and monsters. However the anime would be better if the title was different because its embarrassing to tell your friends that the anime ""Is It Wrong To Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon"" is amazing.",5
is-it-wrong-to-try-to-pick-up-girls-in-a-dungeon,"Let me preface this review by saying that I have only been into anime for about 2 years. I've done my best to watch all the ""Best Anime's"" and fill out my arsenal of anime critiques. I thoroughly believe that this will be one of the better anime's I've seen in those entire two years. We're only 3 episodes in and I can't get enough. I have seen every reviewer nitpick and pick apart some of my favorite anime and I am able to see the flaws in what I watch (I mean by God I watch Highschool DxD, which is by no means a masterpiece) but at this point they couldn't pick this apart in any meaningful way because it's just that good. I went into this like most people did; ""That title is hilarious, let's see how this goes"" and I was blown away. One of my really good friends who HATES fan service and stuff like that LOVES the show so far. I'll be honest, if this show doesn't go into at least a full 25-26 episode arc, I will be incredibly disappointed. Well deserving of many seasons. But why are you still reading this review? GO WATCH IT!!! NOW!!",5
is-it-wrong-to-try-to-pick-up-girls-in-a-dungeon,"I'll admit: I'm one of the filthy casuals who got introduced to the manga after the first anime episode. It's ridiculous, but after one chapter, I was ridiculously hooked and blew through all 31 chapters in one sitting. Then I looked up the light novel and read it all.After coming back to the anime, I cannot help but find that this anime suffers from the same problem Game of Thrones has. There's no doubt that the source material is brilliant, and the anime producers have come up with the best reproduction they could within the confines of the anime medium, but too much character development has been lost in anime at the expense of expediency. There are too many plot cues in the anime which are seemingly out of left field and at random times, but make more sense from the perspective of the manga.This would have been a 5 for me, but 1 star has been deducted for the loss of coherence in the narrative.",5
is-it-wrong-to-try-to-pick-up-girls-in-a-dungeon,"Saw the first episode, and it was amazing, so I did some research and there are light novels and manga this is based on. I loved the first episode, and based on the novels this story with this animation style will be phenomenal! I am 100% excited to watch the rest of this show and will be waiting as the clock counts down every episode except when im at work, in which case... first thing when I get home every episode release!! This story is that good. Great character development, good action scenes, lovable hero and heroines, and a world manipulated by the gods to make me envious of the adventurers that live there.",5
is-it-wrong-to-try-to-pick-up-girls-in-a-dungeon,If you find this season to be awful I truly ask you to read the light novel. Comparing the animated series and the book series most scenes feel lack luster to what they initially are suppose to be. If you are looking for the training sessions or other details that could give you an idea of how much Bell has trained then you should really read the Light novels. Volumes 6 covers the premise of the war games and volume 7 covers the red light district.,4.5
the-promised-neverland,"This review is written having seen ep 1, this is going to be such a good title. Dark, cute, and real. Give it a shot, the actual episode itself has a five star rating at 900 votes.I understand being upset and wanting CR to see your circumstances but those negative reviews are placed over people's work. This is someone's creation and those reviews are negatively impacting it without having seen the show at all. It just seems destructive to the show when it doesn't need to be.",5
the-promised-neverland,"Now I usually don't write reviews, but after all the one-star reviews complaining about region restrictions, I felt it was my duty to set this straight. With that out of the way, on to the show:If I had a scale range from cute to terrifying, this show would cover the whole thing. I felt like I was on a rollercoaster for my emotions. At the beginning all I could think was ""why are their faces so close to the middle,"" and then at the middle I thought, ""something's wrong, they seem too happy and wow this animation is nice,"" and finally at the end I didn't think, I just sat there trying to process what I just witnessed. Also I don't get the hate I've seen surrounding the opening, I like it. This show has the makings to be the best of the season so I hope it lives up to its potential, fingers crossed. Sorry for my crummy review, I'm new to writing my opinion.Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hidep.s. momma's face is going to haunt my nightmares now, just for that... 11 outta 10",5
the-promised-neverland,This is a series that I have been reading since it first showed up as on Shonen Jump. It immediately stood out to me as a misfit for the magazine. It feels much more like a Seinen(targeted at young adults) and thats a good thing! I worried that the adaptation wouldn't be able to capture the tense and gritty atmosphere but they nailed it!. The art style and the delivery are actually a step above the manga so far and the Opening/Ending and the soundtrack are absolutely phenomenal. The portion that this anime will likely cover is my favorite in the manga to date so I'm looking forward to seeing even more.,5
the-promised-neverland,"How do I even begin with this. It has a wholesome vibe at first, although you catch on quickly that the setting isn't what it seems to be, even before all the dark plot points begin happening, and this is all in one episode. It definitely made me widen my eyes when it started getting serious. If you have more of a weak stomach then don't watch this, although if you can handle dark and slight edge, this does it well, very well. I don't feel like I'm watching an edgelord anime just cause it's dark. I recommend this to anyone and let's hope it can continue to deliver a dark enjoyable story.",5
the-promised-neverland,"I began watching this with great expectations that were quickly surpassed by an incredible adaptation that combines great voice acting, suspense, top-notch animation and certain psychological thriller elements to tell its amazing story. This is surely one of the best in the season and for clarification, no real children were harmed or exploited in this anime. If you've made it to the end of this review and I've somehow failed to persuade you to watch this now, then I apologize. Watch it anyways. This is not to be missed.(Written after watching episode 4)",5
the-promised-neverland,"NO SPOILERS:This anime reminds me of the intellectual struggle between Light and L from Deathnote – a covert and ever present battle of logic, strategy, creativity, threat calculations and intelligence analysis between the threat(s) and our little baby geniuses. Furthermore this show has an amazing concept/story, is beautifully animated and carefully directed with some great characters.I find myself thinking about the plight of the baby geniuses in this show during the week while waiting for the next episode – exploring ideas for myself of how I would survive and what clues or logical conclusions could be made next.I highly recommend this show.",5
the-promised-neverland,"I have watched a lot of anime in my years, and I can confidently  say that I have not seen an anime quite like this one. Of course, if I was to compare it slightly to any one out there I would say that people who like Attack on Titan will probably be interested in this too. The anime is very pretty and the characters keep getting more and more interesting as we go along. I think what  I really like about it though, is that the plot has a fast pace that keeps the story moving very fluidly while still giving the audience a second to formulate their opinions and understand what's going on. Emma's view on life shows a refreshing innocence in a world that has become so warped and disturbing while the other two boys show a more tactile and logical perspective of the situation which is interesting to think about and compare against each other. Overall, I think the show does a nice job with revolving around an ideological problem that has no straight forward answer: In a life threatening situation, do you save yourself or risk dying trying to save everyone else?",5
the-promised-neverland,"The first episode clearly defines the characters for you, and gives you a glimpse into their world. A world which is relatively peaceful and happy, but something seems a little off. Near the end of the first episode, you learnSpoiler Alert! Click to show or hide the horrible truth about their world, at the same time as the characters. That they are cattle waiting to be slaughtered, and death is coming for them. This will be a dark tale of survival.The drawing is a little unique, but is well done. The animation quality is good as well. It's very well written and worth watching.",5
the-promised-neverland,I went into this anime completely blind and was immediately knocked on my feet. Everything from the voice acting to the incredibly expressive art had me so drawn in. The story is beautiful and so sad that it just enchants you. The music is gorgeous and the atmosphere is unlike anything i’ve seen in recent years of watching anime. The Promised Neverland is worthy of the title masterpiece. It’s so emotional that I was overwhelmed. I really can’t describe the feeling of despair yet hope that this anime brings. Truly unique and beautiful in ever sense. 10/10,5
the-promised-neverland,"You are doing yourself an absolute disservice if you choose not to watch this. It has been a hell of a long time that a show has made me this anxious every second that it plays out.It throws you back and forth and never gives you the time to settle in and relax. I didn't know anything about the series however for the first time ever I have genuinely considered continuing the manga to find out what happens, and the best news of all is that the second season comes out next year!",5
the-promised-neverland,"Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideThis show makes me smile as much as Sister Krone when she sees the kids. It also makes me destroy my toys like Sister Krone whenever an episode leaves me on cliffhangers. Amazing character development and world building. The show also has really nice animation. You can see that each character has their own kryptonite, which in my opinion every good character needs to be compelling. You see how each of these characters interact. Good show in my opinion.",5
the-promised-neverland,"This anime begins as a mystery, you are thrown into a world where you have no idea what is going on. The begging is upbeat and happy as, in my eyes showing you the perspective of a child it is innocent. However after about halfway through the first episode you realize that things might not be as you have percived them to be. You start to question why there are numbers on the childrens necks, why they aren't allowed past a certain gate, and why there is only one caretaker. Twords the end of the first episode you are thrown into this dark realization that they are just meat on a farm and that nothing that they once belived is true. Is a fabulous tale of cat and mouse, dark an light and everyting in between. This is truly a top tier anime in my eyes and I look forward to it each and every week.",5
the-promised-neverland,"Without spoilers, the original story of the Promised Neverland is an exceptional piece of writing. Filled with moments of absolute clarity, intensity and maturity, it is one piece of fiction that makes me personally proud to be a part of the anime community.The anime has already made fewer storytelling changes (ie. order of events, etc.) yet seems so faithful to the source material in its own special way. The animation is gorgeous as is the art itself. The voice acting is extraordinary as is the anime's pacing, writing and ost. Being someone who already knew what to expect I was still watching this first episode with butterflies in my chest and goosebumps throughout. That is proof that this story is strong, immersive and well directed. This already has the potential to be anime of the yearI personally am very picky when it comes to anime, yet this is a ride I am not getting off of. Be ready for a very FuN aNd HAppY TiMe :))))))",5
the-promised-neverland,"Having read the manga I came into this show it’s some pretty high expectations. And I have to say so far they have been met. The animation is fluid and the facial expressions really convey their emotions. In the beginning scene of the first episode I was really impressed with the amount of characters moving on the screen and how lively they looked.On the the direction so far I have to say that they are really doing a good job. The scenes that are supposed to be tense are tense, and the ones that are supposed to be light hearted are such. The Composition and camera angles are really done well too.So yea, so far the series is living up to the hype, well for me at least. I’m excited to continue this series.",5
the-promised-neverland,"OH HELL YEAH! The Promised Neverland has finally become an anime and oh BOY does it exceed expectations. This masterpiece is part of Shounen Jump's lineup and is about a tactics-based story with lots of lies and deceit... I recommend to jump right on in as it's enjoyed best the less you know about various plot twists and surprises!As for the anime itself, honestly so far I'm enjoying it more than the manga, which is something I never thought was even possible. The animation is top-notch quality with seamless use of 3d and 2d, very smooth and deliberate direction and loveable character designs. The music is gorgeous and in particular, memorable- the show does a wonderful job of integrating music with the tone of a particular scene.The characters are fantastic- the story primarily focuses on the main trio and how their relationships and character arcs develop throughout the story. This anime has done a fantastic job of delivering the plot so far without revealing mysteries or being too obvious with particular sequences. It's just brilliant. This is a hidden gem in the season of Winter 2019 and I highly recommend you check it out!",5
the-promised-neverland,"Never seen a anime show that's so nerve racking and on the edge of my seat each episode. Amazing up beat song for the opening and the lyrics for the song is perfect for this show.I felt like I was on a roller-coaster for my emotions, love the fact from episode 1 it just shows you what they have to face and watching them figuring out each problems as it occurs. Can't wait for season 2 if there ever is one on the way. Please ignore the 1 star review this should be a 5 star with a doubt.",5
the-promised-neverland,"I took my time to write a review, I don't do that kind of stuff, but as you must be aware by now The Promised Neverland was one of my exceptions. Down to the narrative, its amazing how much the viewer can be left in the dark of many things that have occurred chronologically even in the beginning, but still be able to maintain intrigue and suspense in the audience, evidently those behind this piece of work put much effort into the story and how its expressed. I do not want to hassle with evidence or any of the sort, but will acknowledge that it is intellectually engaging. The artwork, more vocatively in the anime, is as observed unique, but it is what probably has caused potential viewers to avoid, postpone or hesitate from watching it. This wasn't some choice to stand out against all the other manga/anime, but it is utilized as a versatile tool, helping to depict the initial (superficial I might add) innocence of the work, which would fool some viewers who would skim the details, and then when in comes to the grotesque elements it swoops down quickly and efficiently to show a more horrific perspective. A clarification, take a look at the faces of each character especially in the first episode, it is deceptively pure, loving and could be even be described as derpy (one of the reasons lending to discouraged viewership), but that quickly changes as the story progresses where the faces show more sinister aspects of the human emotion and motive. Now that's a beautiful use of art within print and animation, a vehicle of suspense and pathos. Now it may have seem I biasedly focused on the art, but in respect to the story, I would like to keep the plot with its twists and turns to the discretion of the reader, and this review to merely serve as encouragement to take time to watch The Promised Neverland.",5
the-promised-neverland,"As a lover of horror/creepy themed anything, I'm always on the hunt for a great piece of horror anime and am usually left disappointed with my findings. Monsters, gore, and other spooky elements aren't too hard to find in anime, but they dont necessarily invite fear into a work. The Promised Neverland brings that lacking element of fear into anime in a short span of 12 episodes. It welcomes viewers with a friendly and warm atmosphere, then quickly replaces it all with its dark elements as the characters have to survive in the very place they once considered home. Each episode is full of mystery and adrenaline pumping goodness making The Promised Neverland a must watch.",5
the-promised-neverland,"Okay I can not begin to describe how amazing this anime is. Even though the plot is somewhat dark it does not take it overboard like some times (Goblin Slayer). the characters are unique, actually have a personality, and don't say the same cliche phrases every anime has. This anime isn't predictable one bit. Just when you think you have it all figured out something happens to completely change the plot. I'd reccomend this to anyone who's used to seeing the same old anime plot with the same characters and plot.",5
the-promised-neverland,"This anime has been one of the best anime I have seen in a while. Rarely do I find anime to be a 5 star rating. The characters are so amazingly well done and I can't wait for season 2.Great development and some twists and turns added into it as well. It is pretty dark and creepy so be warned. The mc is strong and brave. She's not your ""I want to help everyone but then gets in the way or just stands there"" type of female protagonist. Which I appreciate.Not too gruesome and each episode had me wanting more. A chilling thriller where I didn't know what to expect next.",5
the-promised-neverland,"This show is one of the few that TRUELY deserves a five star rating if not more. Sure there are many classics and other good anime that should get 5 stars, but this anime is in a whole other league. in 12 episodes they managed to fit in the most drama, plot twists and amazing story telling I've ever seen. In the beginning I thought I could see right through the plot and guess what would happen but BOY WAS I WRONG. Every episode I was left guessing and by the end I was shocked. Fantastic anime, 5/5.",5
the-promised-neverland,"When I first watched the first episode, I was worried. It gave a lot of clunky exposition right off the bat to the point that it bothered me. But because of the shining reviews I kept watching. Quickly I got rapt up in the mind games, the tense atmosphere, the feeling of dread, and the determination of these kids. If you loved Death Note, a lot of the greatest qualities of that anime are to be found here. I truly haven't had an anime get to my emotions to this level in a LONG time, and I'm overjoyed, yet somewhat perplexed that the anime will be continuing in 2020, as I would love to see more but have no idea where the story will go from here!",5
the-promised-neverland,"If you aren't into psychological anime I would not recommend this series but if you are the dark twisted amazing story is definitely the way to go...At first I thought I wouldn't be into this show, Although it was listed as psychological. The cute look of the characters and the sweet looking story line fooled me in the beginning but with some of the cutest anime's come the darkest stories. I am very into anime that makes you think and invest a lot of my interest in anime that is categorized as psychological. The story not only makes you think because of the genius characters and the fact that they are always 10 steps ahead but also grow to love them. They show emotions towards each other and the situation which creates love able characters and a well thought out plot. I was fully invested from beginning till end and cant wait for another season because this show really deserves it.",5
the-promised-neverland,"The Promised Neverland is a perfect blend of horror, mystery, and action. These beautiful animations work together with the intense sound effects to create a beautiful byproduct that not many anime have done. The byproduct that I'm talking about is the anime's ability to make your butt clench at the scary parts and to similarly feel the relief when they overcome challenges.I think the beauty of this anime is the ability that make the watchers feel what the characters do.    Also their opening is easily the best ever.",5
the-promised-neverland,"This show was amazing. Awesome opening, animation, and tense moments. The only negative about this show imo is that the show could have done so much more with the demons/ outside world being dangerous aspect.  Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideThe whole show is nothing but one big prep phase for an eventual escape, so I wish they could have escaped a lot earlier in the show so we could see more interesting stuff like the group going through hardships in the outside world, or encountering demons that capture them. Sadly, none of that is there.",5
the-promised-neverland,"Usually in anime, it takes me a good couple episodes to get invested. I have to watch maybe three or four episodes in order to feel the characters and truly get a grasp of the world they live in. But in The Promised Neverland, that slow pace of getting to know the characters and feeling iffy on the series, comes to a screaming crash at the end of episode one. Which made me audibly go ""WHAT?"" and click next episode without thinking. I binged the whole season last night. So here's my review, fresh in my mind.I will say some minor spoilers in this review, but anything major is hidden by a spoiler alert, so if you need a confirmed 'yes' or 'no' I stand firmly on the 'WATCH IT NOW' choice. So go on and binge! It's extremely worth while! Let's start with the cons, as I only have a single one: -Sister Krone's character design is unsettling and stereotypical. I'm not going to go on a long speech about it. All I'm saying is that it's blatantly stereotypical. Is it intentional? Probably not, but if you care about that kind of thing- then be warned. It made me a bit uneasy about the character, and I wasn't really okay with how she was portrayed, but that's my ONLY gripe about the show. Now for the positives: -Animation quality is amazing!  Both in regular 2D style and 3D CGI. Yes, I said CGI. I don't quite know if it's exactly that, but the usage of 3D animation blending in this show is perfect for a thriller/horror anime. It looks GOOD. Not cringe worthy or joke worthy. It's genuinely good animation with good use of 3D art, and you're sure to love it. Even the detail within the faces are amazing and can tell you a lot- without revealing a lot.-The story is unique and captures attention at every turn.  I went into this anime playing checkers, only to be confused when I finally realized I was supposed to be playing 4D chess while riding a roller coaster. The plot twists are plentiful, but not needless. Every twist can be traced back to an earlier point in the show. Making you go ""WAIT THAT'S WHAT THAT MEANT?"" or even details in the scene can hint at future events. It's a show that is smart about it's plot twists- not adding them in just because they need a shocker. This alone makes me constantly think about what's coming next, and makes me fully invested in what I'm watching. -The protagonists are likable and smart.   The whole show is a cat and mouse metaphor at least in this season. Can the mice outsmart the cat? Or will the sneaky cat with patience persevere? Both the protagonists and antagonists in this show are insanely clever and smart. Making it all the more interesting. Someone has a solution for one problem, only to be thwarted by the other character- but WAIT, they thought about that! So there's an alternative! But no, that won't work.. then how about this! The show constantly makes you think about solutions to problems, how the characters can make it out of this situation, and ultimately make you wonder- how can they truly escape? With their intense refusal to give up, you'll want to root for these characters- but also want figure out how they came up with such clever and smart ideas. -The tension and anxiety feeling is spot on.  My review is getting ultra long, so I'll make this and my last point quick. This show is a thriller. It's suspenseful. And it's anxiety inducing. It works well because of all the previous points I mentioned, and it's one of the absolute best anime in this area that I've seen to date. If you like the intense, anxiety inducing, uncertain feeling- then this is your show. -Finally, it's dark and twisted.  The show reveals to you early on that the world they live in is dark and twisted. This is the spoiler alert, so skip down if you don't want it-Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hide they find out that all the kids before them were sent out. To be eaten. By massive demon like creatures. And the first episode shows a six year old girl dead in a truck. Yeah, wow. The deaths, facial animations, dark colors, and intense story make this show dark and twisted. And the nice reality that you thought was there in episode one quickly vanishes when you realize that it's not what it seems. Can these three protagonists (and supporting cast) make it out alive? Or will they meet their end in a world filled with darkness? Watch the show to find out. This is by far one of my favorite shows in recent years, so I highly recommend it. We're guaranteed a season 2, but the ending of season 1 was still satisfying. This review was long, but if you read it all, thanks! I hope you take a chance and watch the show, because I loved every episode. I held off watching it, but I don't recommend you hold off on it. It's worth it.",5
the-promised-neverland,"The Promised Neverland is an extremely great adaptation of a horror mixed with some mystery anime. It holds many inconspicuous secrets, and they hold the horrors of the film. The tightening tension in The Promised Neverland is executed so well that I really couldn't stop watching. The thrilling feeling that someone is right behind you was almost constant for me whenever Emma, Norman and Ray were sneaking around, unravelling their life mysteries, Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideand how to escape their almost inevitable deaths due to the harvest.Throughout The Promised Neverland, the author of the story intentionally leaves out many details and aspects of various scenes, building up a big twist later in the series.It was done so well, that I found myself being surprised almost every episode, and needed to know what was going to happen next. Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideA very prime example is during the 2 month period when Norman is shipped off to the demons. It seems that Emma and Ray had given up, but all of that was debunked in the closing episodes of season 1, as one huge final twist occurs and changes the plot dramatically. In The Promised Neverland, it seems that Ray had set himself on fire, and the episode continued to convince us that Ray was in fact on fire as Mum checked to see her tracking device to see if Ray was in the fire. He was. After many events, the Mother soon realises that the escape was being executed that very instant, and then was cognizant of how she was tricked to believe that Ray was in the fire when in all actuality, he wasn't. Even though that is a huge twist in itself, the author couldn't help themselves but include a very deliberate twist in the closing scenes of the series. We found out that Ray was actually the daughter of ""Mum"" and this was very vaguely hinted during one scene in a few previous episodes. Ray tells Emma and Norman that he knew about the harvest due to him not having infantile amnesia and hearing a sinister lullaby while only being a fetus. Just before when the reveal of Ray being mothers son, he hums a melody that brings memories back to Mother of her own childhood who heard the very same melody from a friend that she had lost to the harvest as well. This was enough evidence for me to realise that Ray was, in fact, Mother's son before ray said: Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hide""Mum, why did you give birth to me?""The Promised Neverland definitely has its promises for the upcoming seasons, and I can't wait till the next season. The excellent execution of plot twists, tightening tension, dynamic dialogue really brought this series together, making it my favourite anime I have seen to date, and on edge for 2020 when the next season comes out.All in all, The Promised Neverland holds many fantastic aspects that makes itself unique, and the outstanding storyline just adds that special sauce to it all, giving me a ride of a lifetime. I highly recommend The Promised Neverland to anyone, even if you are not a big fan of horror as I wasn't as well.",5
the-promised-neverland,"Truly an amazing concept, of which I personally have never seen before. It is only a few episodes yet I am completely invested in the characters since the first episode. Grab your tissues, blanket and relax, because you'll be in for an emotional ride. It is truly a masterpiece from the artwork, character development, the thematic music, to the innovative story line. I highly recommend anyone to watch this series. Cannot wait till season 2! Artwork: 10/10Characters: 10/10Music: 10/10Storyline: 10/10",5
the-promised-neverland,"I've never watched an anime that was so mesmerizing. The combination of deceiving character design and a plot that will make you SCREAM AND CRY is amazing. Even though I read the manga beforehand, I was still itching to see the next episode. I love this show so much.Now, onto the REAL charm of the show.Phil. For those of you who don't know, Phil is an adorable tiny kid who is too precious for this world. He was a permanent uwu face and literally is the most pure thing ever. He's really cute.If you read all of that, thanks.",5
the-promised-neverland,"I am always reluctant to talk about young animes in the greatest of all time debate because...well, they are young, and it would be a disservice to other animes that have maintained excellence for much more episodes...but I will make an exception for this one.In a year filled to the brim with action-oriented shonen anime, I was overjoyed to see an anime that did not rely on that to be effective and unique, but instead focusing on what I feel should really matter in any good media of storytelling: An outstanding story with impeccable and fleshed out characters.What makes the Promised Neverland stand out is not just the story, but man is the story impeccable. I always love animes that build up to a lasting crescendo, and TPN left me emotionally drenched by the time episode 12 of season 1 ended. The story is perfectly paced, with a draw-dropping first episode that introduces all the characters and gives you a clear definite plot. But as the storyline goes, you will realise it is anything but clear cut. The middle act is strong as well and characters like Sister Krone keep that part well fun and enjoyable. What truly makes this anime an all-time great in terms of seasonal shows or arcs is definitely the final four episodes. Everything...I mean everything you are looking for in a plot-driven show, you will find in these last episodes.The characters are also wonderfully nuanced. From the naive yet deceptively smart Emma, to the genius good soul, Norman, and of course my personal favourite, the extreme realist, Ray. The three main characters are outstanding and easy to relate with on any level. Every decision made makes sense withing the framework of the story and the world they are in. Even the supporting characters that you might not like at the beginning come through in remarkable fashion by the time the credits roll. You could not hate any character in this show, and that is a testament to the ridiculously impeccable work put in to make them vibrant both in orientation and development.I also would like to give a worthy mention to the PERFECT direction and camera work for a thriller seiken like this one. The team at Clover Works must be fans of the manga because never have I seen so much work put into camera movements and cinematography before. This is necessary for a horror anime like The Promised Neverland. And how could I forget Isabella's lullaby? Both the addictive OP song and the actual soundtrack for the anime are to die for, but it is the Promised Neverland's soundtrack that truly tugs at the heartstrings. The fact that they were able to weave it into the actual storyline and make our villain more relatable made it even more touching.I could go on and on, but I will conclude by saying The Promised Neverland also has my second best villain of ALL TIME, and is, to me, The Promised Neverland Season 1 is the best singular season ever made, usurping the first season of Tokyo Ghoul. Bravo, Clover Works...bravo.",5
the-promised-neverland,"I waited until the whole season finished to write this review. The show had me hooked from the very beginning. Every episode was captivating and well planned. In short, this season was spectacular. With beginning, middle and end well defined and very well developed, the desire to continue watching is very great and the expectation is up there for the next season. The music is a bop, and UVERworld did an amazinggg job",5
the-promised-neverland,"My mind just keeps getting continuously blown by how good this show is. Seriously. I don't even know where to begin. The animation and direction of this show is so interesting, the characters are all so incredibly fleshed out and believable. The writing is phenomenal. I love a show that can make you feel like you've got everything figured out and then it turns that thought on its head in the next scene!",5
the-promised-neverland,"This is a great anime series, it's one where every week I anxiously wait for the next episode to air. It's unlike most animes (at least most that I'm used to) which revolve around fighting; this one is more about secrets being learned, the inability to (effectively) fight, and the scramble to survive.One thing that this show has that every (good) show has is the cliffhangers where at the conclusion of each episode there is either a significant hope/plan for the protagonists or a significant setback.",5
the-promised-neverland,"This series is absolutely incredible it has a great storyline and don't even get me started in the animation. From the first episode you can see humane feelings as if it were real people and it goes straight to the point which is really great compared to other shone series which have filler episodes and don't get straight to the point. But this show goes straight to the point making the viewer hooked from the beginning and also it has huge twists which will leave you almost dumbfounded while you're watching. Because of this twists you are expecting something to come at every moment but when this twists happen it will leave you mesmerized in every way; animation, action, story and the premise. It is so good that i can refer things as the characters intelligence to Death Note, The animation to One Punch Man, the premise of this show to Erased and the heart warming characters to Ha Ji Me No Ippo. It really brings a smile to my face to see such a good anime like this changing the way we see shounen in and by itself.",5
the-promised-neverland,"Something absolutely incredible. I have never seen anything this masterfully executed in all my life. Such tension and drama are something only ever seen in movies, but this pulls it off to another level.Hopelessness, fear, terror, revenge, corrupted minds... an experience, more than anything else, this show is sure to blow minds with its incredibly dark atmosphere and constant, never-ending barrage of plot twists.Seriously, all of the people behind this, including the original writer, are masterminds of their craft. They just have this... endless bag of tricks to pull from - and each twist is better than the last.Nothing you know is true. Everything can change in an instant. This harsh reality never ceases to amaze.Due to this, however, the show is built on surprises. Just, be careful. And watch out for certain reviews...",5
the-promised-neverland,"After watching the first three episodes, I already plan on picking up the manga to find out what happens next! I am so hooked on the story and love how original and unique it is. The character design is amazing and I can already tell that there will be amazing character development from all sides in future episodes. The animation is beautiful and the music is great. So interested in seeing the demons more closely and finding out more about this dystopian world. Cannot wait for more!",5
the-promised-neverland,"This anime was absolutely phenomenal, from start to finish. And now I hear season 2 is coming in 2020, which is absolutely fantastic. The storyline actually develops more and more with each episode compared to a new story each one. The characters have dynamic personalities and aren't over the top in the slightest. It kept you on the seat of your chair with each episode. More and more despair but then BOOM it's right back in your face with something groundbreaking. This is truly my favorite anime right behind darling in the franxx.",5
the-promised-neverland,"To start you off, the visuals are so beautiful within it, and I suspect there will be even more breathtaking moments. The scenery and the style is refreshing, and pleasing to look at. However, there may be points for some people, that it will be the exact opposite.For the characters, I already feel drawn towards them. I'm loving their designs and personalities, how they act with others and how the represent themselves. I've only seen the first episode, and there will of course be more to them that I have yet to see, but I automatically loved them since the first few minutes.The story line is very interesting. Of course, there are some obvious red flags that like to appear, but it's still very inciting to see what exactly may happen. It's very cute and bubbly, and then an unexpected twist that suddenly changes the whole atmosphere within this one episode.I feel like they did an amazing job pulling in viewers, since I honestly can't wait for the next episode. I can see this show becoming big within the year of anime. However, I do know there will be a lot of competition from all of the other anime that have been released of this year. Yet, I still believe this will be the top for most people.I have very high expectations.",5
the-promised-neverland,"I have read the manga and upon hearing of this release I became the very hype. After watching this episode (since I actually watched it instead of complaining or complaining about those who are complaining), the adapting of the demon scene was very well done and had given me chills. The talent of the voice actors is great, the part where Emma was hyperventilating gave extra effect to the scene and the reality of the situation. Hoping to see more of this series.",5
the-promised-neverland,"Wow. Just wow. That's seriously all I can say about this phenomenal series. Time and time again have I gone and rewatched this show, always a complete mess afterwards. The twits and turns and methodical advances these witty characters make just lures you into the series each and every episode begging for more. The mind games Isabella and the main trio pull off is so boggling to decipher but yet always somehow leaves the viewer satisfied whether in a melancholy gloomy state of mind or not. It's fantastic!! Each character having discernible personalities all ranging from contemplative and quiet to blissful and full of life to pure evil and immorality. Seeing the innocence of Emma and Norman being ripped away at such an early stage in the show really sets the mood and tone as what's to come. It's dark, it's alluring, and it's an absolute masterpiece. Thank you so much Kaiu Shirai and Posuka Demizu for this stupendous form of entertainment. Job majorly well done",5
the-promised-neverland,"The Promised Neverland is dark, and hopeful, and driven. It is excellently developed and put into action. The world and the characters are unveiled and built upon brilliantly.  Every time this show answers one of your questions, it gives you handfuls of questions more. You will be surprised time and time again— and you will love it. I ended up canceling all my Saturday plans and binged the show in one day. 100% worth it. I cannot recommend The Promised Neverland enough, to any and all.",5
the-promised-neverland,"This series is dystopian, it's dark, intense, crazy and wildly unique. It doesn't follow any other anime as far as plot goes. It's its own thing.  The 3 main characters Norman, Ray, and Emma mostly live carefree lives in an orphanage with only one set rule: don't get near the fence or the gate at the end of the property. Mom says so. Mom is their ever-loving caretaker. One fateful night when one of the next children are up to be adopted, that child leaves the house without her cherished doll. Norman and Emma rush to the gate to deliver the doll to the girl before she leaves... only to be faced with a truth too horrifying to be put into words. When they discover the horrible reality they're living in, they decide to do everything they possibly can to escape the House and Mom, with all the children they can possibly take with them. 10/10. I haven't been so mindblown or felt so stressed in awhile when watching something. It's actually been an age since I've last seen an anime even. So I binge-watched this and wow was it an experience.",5
the-promised-neverland,"After having just finished the final episode, I can say from my own personal opinion and perspective that this anime adaptation is Genius. I will give no spoilers but know this show faces serious ethical issues in a way that is equally eloquent, harsh and inspiring. I would recommend at least watching the first 3 episodes and let me/us know what you think, this show has inspired me to become a humanitarian locally to do what I can do as a seemingly powerless human being in world of beautiful yet suffering souls. Excellent anime, 10 stars from me.",5
the-promised-neverland,"The Promside Neverland, in my opinion, would have to be one of the best animes 2019 has seen. Anime and shows today, in general, are swarmed with overused plots and stories that make you forget what true imagination can create, and this show will help you remember!This Anime embodies all the key points you want out of an amazing show, it has well-done characters, a unique and interesting plot, thrill, danger, and above all risk! Truly a show that kept me and I'm sure everyone else at the edge of their seat for every episode. The show takes twists and turns just when you thought you had everything figured out, leaving you wondering at the end of each episode ""What the heck is going to happen next?"" as you race to hit the button to start the next episode.The Promised Neverland has rightfully earned its place as one of my favorite animes thus far, and I am anxiously awaiting the arrival of season two!",5
the-promised-neverland,"It's decent enough and I recently saw it in comparison to some other anime I really liked so I gave it a try due to the short length. Watched it over the course of two days and found out that I wasn't really too much of a fan. I feel the premise isn't truly explored well enough and it isn't until the 12th episode that I truly felt the world building I wanted come into play and that was only in a marginal sense. I also didn't personally jive well with the art style but I can't take off points for that. Objectively, I do feel that the animation was not quite enabling the story all that well. In anime like Mob Psycho or Attack on Titan you can definitely see the animation choices adding to the storytelling but here it fell a little flat for me.I felt I could see nearly every twist coming and almost nothing surprised me, but it didn't draw from the story all too much. It just wasn't as engaging. I contemplated quitting the anime a few episodes in but the length for right now is just too short to quit on. Overall the story is fairly predictable but all around a cool premise and worth the 12 episodes of watching if you want something a little creepy. The show maintains a balance between light and heavy. The opening also SLAPS so that kept me in for the long haul.",5
the-promised-neverland,"I really didn't read any synopsis or preview of this anime before watching and I was simply looking for a sorta cutesy anime to watch in between other series, but after the first episode I was taken aback and forced to rethink what it meant for a series to be truly great. Even though it wasn't one of my favorite genres, the writing and execution was so perfect that I couldn't not watch the next episode. Even when watching filled me with pain and anguish, feeling that I couldn't help the characters, I knew I was hooked without ever realizing it. It such a masterpiece; I didn't want to love it but I had no choice. The progression of the story, the plot-twists (the oh-so-many plot twists), and even just the character depth, all of these things added-up to what in totality is a true masterpiece of an anime. I'm not shy about praising the series because it went in odd directions that I never expected and explored different avenues that I didn't think possible; overall I could never more wholeheartedly recommend a series to someone else than this one. I truly didn't want to love it; I just wanted a simple, cute series to pass the time, but I stumbled upon a gem that wouldn't let me look away. Please do yourself a favor and watch this anime!",5
the-promised-neverland,"This show deserves a five-star rating. It's emotional, dark, and one of a kind. It makes me wonder about the future, about the possibilities of waking up one day and realize we are all but a livestock to the otherworldly creatures. I just couldn't imagine myself in that situation, so I personally admire the toughness and determination of the characters in this anime despite the fact that they are 20 years younger than me. I'd probably just cower and wait for my death if that was me. I can't wait for the second season, if there is any. This anime is highly recommended to anyone who wants to watch something different other than cookie-cutter, predictable shows out there.Good job, noitamA!",5
the-promised-neverland,"Sublime.That's how I would describe this piece of art. I mainly watch animes that have a hardcore focus on story, and this is one of the best so far. If you've since Erased, this will not disappoint. Immediately, you're thrown into a dark dystopian world living a ""dream"" until you wake up to the harsh reality. Upon realization, you know that you need to do something or those that you care about will die. You study, work hard, and arm yourselves with the tools that you believe that will help you escape. Allies come and go. After each wall, a higher one exists. The light you saw down the dark hall glimmers a few feet always out of reach. Persist, and perhaps, you may find yourself in a Promised Neverland....The twists will keep you guessing. A cat and house game with Holmes and Moriarty is tame compared to this. Be prepared to be thrilled....",5
the-promised-neverland,"It's hard to express how well-made this show was without spoilers, but suffice it to say that it's very well-crafted. It hints at truths and then lets them simmer long enough for you to forget, or doubt, even if you noticed the clue, so that  even reveals you saw coming catch you off-guard. And there were plenty of twists that blindsided me entirely.By turns uplifting and horrifying, comedic and tragic, with an undercurrent of cosmic horror and a constant thread of interwoven mysteries - some of which it wisely chooses never to resolve - this is one of those rare shows that will pull you in and not let you go even long after you're done watching.And the scene with the long hair will hit you like a ton of bricks, especially if you've ever had kids of your own. You'll know it when it comes.",5
kurokos-basketball,"As soon as the OP music starts I have the biggest grin on my face. It was one of those animes I debated watching until there was around 5 episodes out then just went for it out of boredom and I cannot stress enough how glad I was that I did.I've never been one for sports anime, shamelessly to say it was the animu hasbando effect that drew me in the most, but I can easily say 43 episodes later that this is one of the best animes I've ever had the pleasure of watching and I'm so glad it exists.The combination of visually interesting characters, smooth animation and totally intense, compelling basketball is really what makes KnB so fantastic. I'm always left shocked with each 'power' unveiling. Even more shocked when the 20 minutes fly by in what feels like 20 seconds. It could be understandable to say that there are slight slow 'filler' periods, particularly throughout the first season, however I can't say that there's a single episode I haven't enjoyed.Anyone debating it or even skipping across it. STOP AND JUST WATCH IT.",5
kurokos-basketball,"I know what you're thinking.  Sports anime?  LAME!  It has to be boring and played out so over dramatically and did I mention LAME?!  But ALAS!  EUREKA! VOILA!  Here's your prayers of an actually captivating sports anime answered!   Go on a journey with Kuroko, the white mage of this anime!  Supporting his team with misdirection and lack of presence! LIKE A NINJA, but in basketball! Plus you get ""hot"" anime guys and a strong female character.  You even might learn a thing or two about basketball ;)Awesome anime, will rewatch.",5
kurokos-basketball,"I stayed up until 6AM watching every episode (1 to 13)! I even made this crunchyroll account just to write this review! Not only is the anime drawn well (and if you guys didn't notice, the basketball nets are animated not drawn), and you can't help but get pumped and cheer while watching the games, but the themes it uses are simple yet brilliant! I'm not even recommending you to watch it, I'm hyperbolically threatening you to watch it! You will be more than pleased!",5
kurokos-basketball,"You don't have to be a sports fan to enjoy this anime. I'm not into basketball. At. All. And sports/sports anime aren't my ""thing."" But I saw the reviews were really good, and I thought, ""Eh, I'll give it a chance."" I am so happy I gave it a chance after all.This is the only anime I can think of now (besides when I was like twelve or so), where I ""fist pumped in the air with literal adrenaline rush"" when a character I liked was victorious.Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideAomine is insanely good! :D I'm now several episodes into Season 2. If you decide to watch this anime, get past the very first episode. I wasn't addicted by the first episode, but afterwards I found myself unable to stop watching. I don't know how it will be for other people, but I can say for myself, usually a non-sports-anime-fan, that I'm really enjoying it.",5
kurokos-basketball,"It took me that extra bit of willpower to start this anime, but once I clicked play on that first episode, I could not stop. Within a few episodes, I could feel the adrenaline pumping and my heart rate rising. Simply waiting for the next episode to wait was so unbearable, that I decided to camp out on my sofa and marathon all of season 1, just in time for season 2. It was this anime that truly had the power to push me through my studies because it was not your typical ""Good wins every time."" Seeing Seirin and its members fight through all the struggles and still lose matches really connected with me, because there are countless times I studied with my all for a test, then received a result that was terrible. I sound really silly, but thinking back to certain quotes, like Kagami's ""There's no such thing as useless effort!"" and Kiyoshi's ""If you wanna climb a mountain, you obviously aim for the top. But you gotta enjoy the scenery too"" really pushed me on.I was so stoked about this anime that I got a few friends equally excited! Twelfth grade ended a month ago, and I got a really satisfying result. One of the reasons is this anime. I truly recommend it for a roller-coaster ride of motivation and inspiration!Can't wait for season 3!",5
kurokos-basketball,"I was a bit skeptical at first, seeing as how the only anime I've watched and actually enjoyed being Free (swimming anime). But I wanted to try another sport out, and I didn't exactly hate basketball, I was neutral, but honestly after watching this show I have to admit it has become one of my favorite sports anime ever. The characters are absolutely entertaining and well done, the comedy is also a nice touch, the plot is also engaging, I can't find ONE thing I dislike about this anime. Not to mention the fundamentals are not so hard to grasp after a while of watching.I'm definitely glad I finally decided to give this anime a chance, it has definitely made me stay up late on countless nights (XD) but I don't regret a single minute of it! Can't wait for more eps, ahhhhhhhhhhhh, I'm so obsessed :')",5
kurokos-basketball,"Kuroko's Basketball is a truly unique sports Anime, that I would recommend to anyone who loves a well animated, well portrayed, well paced and overall well done Anime. (Most of its attributes have been stated in other reviews so what I aim to do is a deeper analysis on the main pros and cons people found) The CON  - UNREALISTIC GAME PLAYWith all that said some individual find or will find the game play is some what unrealistic for them and this is true to a certain extent but not entirely, How....to a person who has not played basketball in a somewhat professional manner or recognized team, it will appear unrealistic, but to those who have it is very close to reality, and this is where I bring the whole point of portrayal (or view), because professional or semi-professional Basketball players will understand that during the game when you are in the court, game-play such as dribbling seems very fast paced to you and things such as special moves appearing in slow motion, power moves and inner self dialog and analysis are going through your head and your brain views them in an extreme manner close as to what is portrayed in the Anime, but to the average onlooker outside with the untrained eye who is not under competitive pressure the game does not seem that out of the ordinary, and to them 'Kuroko's Basketball' will appear to have unrealistic game-play. Hence portrayal again comes into play, because the Anime (especially the Game play) is done through-out the eyes of a player in the field the actions appear superhuman or unrealistic to the viewers. So it all comes down to perception, the only real false attributes that are unrealistic is the Aura around the players at times and the excess sweat that seems to fly around of players like they carry around personal sprinklers but... HEY that's anime.Over all summary - The PRO'SThe anime has great character development, and has the rare story telling ability of not always having the Main character's team as the victor in each game (including the important ones), Not simply centering on one main character through each episode, which is portrayed by some episodes following characters outside of the main characters team and having a significant number of episodes where the main characters are simply spectator in the crowd and while the attention is focused on other teams playing, this aspect of the Anime helps to give a sense of realism and practicality that helps in making the Anime more appealing and close to heart as the realistic downfall, failures and success of characters makes the viewer appreciate it more. The humor is timed perfectly and is kept in check and does not appear too forceful like some anime tend to do. The anime is also not filled with too much perverted fan-service which leave it unblemished of its seriousness. Kuroko's Basket ball is truly an Anime worth watching that keeps it real to high extent but not to the max to the point of making it overly serious because...Hey...It is still Anime after all.I give it a 4.5 out of 5 Stars - or 9 out of ten points",5
kurokos-basketball,"This show.  This. Show.  Sport animes in general are so much fun because they are realistic, yet fantastic.  And by fantastic I mean that they flutter along the edge of fantasy, gleefully crossing the line into ridiculous more and more (and further and further).  This show does a fantastic job at one-upping itself just when you think you couldn't laugh any harder or getting any closer to the edge of your seat.  If a show about an athlete whose talent is essentially being ridiculously unnoticeable doesn't catch your attention, there's something wrong.  I watched this entire show in less than 3 days because I just couldn't stop.  I cannot wait for the next season!",5
kurokos-basketball,"For someone who has watched Captain Tsubasa (both versions), Slam Dunk!, Eyeshield 21, and many other great sport series, and NOT being a basketball fan at all myself, I have to say this is the best sports series I have seen. Soundtrack, characters, directing, opening and ending sequences, the animation (Production I.G). I could write for hours, but this is a series that you have to see, but most importantly, you must feel. Prepare for quite the adrenaline rush. The wait for Season 2 will be really painful. Masterful in almost every way. Masterpiece.  96/100.",5
kurokos-basketball,"This review is for both Season's of Kuroko honestly, what can I say? It's a Basketball Anime except way more exciting, since Basketball is one of my favorite Sport's I always get heavily into it, Each Generation of Miracle member has something unique about their play style in the games, and Midorima is my favorite for making his 3 shots from anywhere.. Quite frankly if you have seen Slam Dunk or just love Basketball in general you will enjoy this series. Even though there's special skills and such that can't be used in a real life Basketball game this Anime is very realistic and true to what real Basketball represents. Recommended to any sports fan and especially any Basketball Fan.",5
kurokos-basketball,"First off, take a look at the sidebar on the right, and check out how many 5 star reviews there are for this series.  Those are there for a reason, and I'll tell you why.Kuroko's Baskeball does a great job of being entertaining for people who don't necessarily enjoy sports.  This is the true sign of brilliant writing and pacing; it will become apparent as you check out the first few episodes.  All the signs of a great shonen are here - a group of dedicated and powerful individuals, lots of challenges to overcome, and light humor to break up the pace every now and then.The thing that sets this series apart for me is the main character, Kuroko himself.  It's quite rare for a shonen to designate such an enigmatic and mysterious individual as the carrier for the series, and the differences found here really start to come out in his personality.  He's a total quiet genius, without the physical aptitude to succeed in what he loves (don't we all want to be?)... and quite honestly, the wacky ways they introduce him influencing basketball despite not being built for it are fun as heck to get behind and enjoy.Long story short, give this series a couple episodes if you're interested in treading new ground.  Sports anime is always a hard sell to non-fans of the sport involved, but this one transcends easily.  And you'll love it even more if you're a basketball fan - they do include a bit of tech talk there along the way!",5
kurokos-basketball,"I use to love watching basketball in the 90's a lot. I was a Bulls fan then, and from Chicago as well. This anime brought back those feelings. You will actually jump for joy seeing the team win, and be waiting to see them play again the next season when they loose. To do a sport anime, and still make a viewer jump up and excited as I was. Is very difficult to pull off. And this one did it. It was able to get me off my seat. All I needed was a beer, and some chips, and watch Kuroko play his game. The anime director did a fantastic job of blending sports in a anime. A must see for all sports fans!",5
kurokos-basketball,"This anime is purely a great title for a sports anime. Even if you don't like basketball, or you don't know anything about it, its worth it to at least give it a shot. It can be argued that although the story doesn't shine the brightest, the characters certainly make up for that. It takes you into the eyes of a 6th man (which is the man who comes of the bench first and in reality aren't as nearly as hyped up as the starting 5) who used to play for a team full of powerhouse players. And because they are so good, they haven't become good team players. So Kuroko (the 6th man) wants to prove to his former teammates that Basketball is a teams sport. Although it is a sports anime, it is full of funny moments and some sad ones.In response to a 3 star review I read saying how ""predictable"" the outcome of each game the teams in the anime played was, have you not payed attention at all? The story here is how 2 players develop their skills to try and beat the top players in the nation. It's stupid for someone to say, the games were obvious to predict because in any sport, if you put a developing team vs a nationally strong one, anyone would predict the stronger one would win. So are your predictions for each game going to be right most of the time? Yeah they will especially when you see the flow during the game.For example, if I put the Miami Heat vs Charlotte Bobcats it is fair to assume the Heat would win. This is EXACTLY what is going on in this anime. A super power team full of basketball stars going against a team of hard workers.",5
kurokos-basketball,"For someone who is not sports oriented in the least bit, I am utterly hooked on this anime!  I first stumbled across this series last year.  I was bored out of my mind and decided, ""Hey, why not give this one a shot.""  So, I clicked on the link, not expecting much.  Man, was I in for a very pleasant surprise!  This series has everything I could wish for in a great anime!  I find myself on the edge of my seat with every episode.  The character development is great to watch and now that the new season has started I know I can expect to see great things!One episode and you will be positively hooked!...even if you're totally ignorant when it comes to sports...like me. :-)",5
kurokos-basketball,"I really have to say that I was never a fan of sport animes until I came upon Kuroko's Basketball.Each episode starts off with an introduction of the ""Generation of Miracles"", five middle school players from Teiko, who have extraordinary abilities in basketball that only come along every ten years. The first episode then goes on to introduce the two protagonists Kuroko Tetsuya and Kagami Taiga. Right off the bat, these two protagonists are formed by this concept of yin and yang, where Kuroko is more of the ""silent"" and ""passive"" type, while Kagami is more boisterous. However, both come together with the same goal in mind: to defeat the Generation of Miracles.Thus, the plot begins to unfold as Kuroko, Kagami and the Seirin basketball team undergo the hardships of basketball in hopes of becoming the ""#1 Team in Japan"". Personally, the storyline is alright considering it follows a simple ""reaching our shared goal"" scenario, but it makes up with the character development. Also, don't expect for each game to be completely ""realistic"". For example, Kuroko is superb at passing, but cannot even do a lay-up, certain characters are able to shoot 3-pointers flawlessly, etc. Keep in mind that even though the character's abilities may not be too realistic, it does not take away from the building tension that each basketball game creates.The characters in Kuroko's Basketball each have their own defining characteristics. Kuroko is shown as a physically weak (for basketball) guy who doesn't seem to have any basic fundamentals for basketball. However, when he reveals his passing skills it becomes obvious that there is more to him than meets the eye. Kagami is introduced as a tall, masculine guy who just transferred from America and becomes the team's ace player in a heartbeat. Throughout each episode, Kuroko's past slowly unwinds, which becomes the backdrop of the story. Believe me when I say the character development in this anime is done very well, and it is what makes the plot even livelier.The score is quite nice, seeing as how I.G. Productions is behind the scenes. The music's tone changes just at the right time and place, which adds to the emotional scenes and the tension of each basketball game. The animation is also done very well, so there aren't many complaints to be shared here.Overall, this anime is a nice choice for the Spring line-up of animes. Its quite rare, to say the least, to be introduced to a sport anime done as well as Kuroko's Basketball. There is no doubt that Kuroko's Basketball will be compared to Slam Dunk, which is a classic in the sport anime category. However, let me say that Kuroko's Basketball can easily stand on its own. At first, I was not very interested in sports anime, simply because I'm not an avid sports fan, but Kuroko's Basketball is much more than basketball. Kuroko's Basketball presents the concept of teamwork, overcoming obstacles that life may present (in this case basketball), and true passion. Give it a try, it won't hurt you.",5
kurokos-basketball,"i love this anime so much. the balance of the intensity in the games but having its silly moments at the same time is what i love about kuroko's basketball. the plot of the show is amazing, plays out every character very well, and the development of each character is amazing. every episode either had me at the edge of my seat, putting a smile on my face, or making me feel warm inside because of how wholesome it is. at first i thought this was just some other sports anime, but it now has become one of my favorite, if not, my favorite anime ever. i tried recommending this anime to my other friends and them responding with, ""i might not like it, i'm not a sports person."" just made me aggravated, i'm not a sports person either, but i still love the show. you don't have to be a sports person to love a sports anime. to sum up, if you haven't watched this anime yet, do it now. it's an amazing anime. it has numerous amounts of people rating this show with 5 stars for a reason. so go watch it ;)Rating: 10/10 - would watch again and again and again...",5
kurokos-basketball,"I found this anime after dragging myself through Eyeshield 21 (which got me hooked on NFL but it was wayyy too long)I'm 4 years behind on the hype, but, this*clap* anime *clap*.Every single episode is extremely enjoyable and the whole anime is so action packed that my love for basketball was reignited after 4 long years.To whoever is reading this right now. YOU HAVE TO WATCH IT OML ISSOGOOD!Refreshingly action-packed with every episode leaving you with an irresistible urge to click the next episode.",5
kurokos-basketball,"Kuroko no Basuke blends the line between traditional sports anime and a shounen battle anime, meanwhile sprinkling a decent side helping of characterization in that ensures even if you aren't a fan of basketball you'll still probably find yourself enjoying it. It straddles the line perfectly between legitimate sports and superpowered fantasy sports so you aren't left bored, but at the same time aren't so disconnected with reality that it stops being representative of the sport at all (looking at you Prince of Tennis). It's full of bromance, friendship power, and is guilty of the common sports anime trope of turning every single play into a mindgame of the century. But if you can get over that there's a super solid anime waiting for you both from a story and action perspective.I'm particularly fond of the antagonists they set up. Each of them is a superpowered monster that couldn't exist in the real world but more importantly they're each given very solid personalities. And it doesn't feel like ""I'm egotistical just to be egotistical"", each of them is given a solid backstory to cement why they've become what they are. And in a way makes them just as much a sympathetic main character as our leads, rather than where most sports manga just turn them into reprehensible monsters to be defeated. You'll actually grow to like many of them just as much as our heroes.Beyond the story the animation and music are all top notch. In particular after the success of the first season the second saw a drastic increase in animation quality and some scenes are a genuine marvel to behold. The whole thing has a truly addictive quality and more than once you'll get to the end of an episode only to find yourself saying, ""Just one more""...and the next thing you know it's 6AM.In short there's something here for everyone and if you can get over some traditional sports anime tropes (superpowered antagonists, toooonsss of bromance, etc) you'll find this is one of the best examples of the genre.",5
kurokos-basketball,"This is definitely one of my favorite animes/mangas of all time. Though some of the moves are ridiculous and some parts seem impossible to apply to real life basketball, I still love it, which is rare for me. I usually don't like sport animes, and I don't often enjoy watching action animes (obviously this doesn't mean I don't like any). But, it has a combination of comedic moments and serious moments and they're played at the right time. I can't wait for the updates! I just read the manga because I couldn't wait to see what happened next and it got me even more excited to see the action in an animation! This show absolutely deserves 5 stars from me (:",5
kurokos-basketball,"-SOME MILD SPOILERS-A disclaimer: I don't give away four and five star ratings. This is a 3.5 star show, but they don't give half stars. So if you're on the fence, and you love basketball like I do, you'll find this show very quaint for a lot of reasons. It's actually a fairly neat cultural artifact, because it illustrates how basketball is simply not a dominant element of Japanese sports culture, much less mainstream culture. American viewers in particular will find this show uneven (as will any viewer who comes from a country that is basketball crazy - Filipinos, Argentines, Brazilians, Spaniards, etc.). The show portrays certain players as having supernatural powers while playing basketball. This is actually pretty cool, and the viewer will have fun watching a team try to figure out how to stop a guy who can hit 3 pointers from the other side of the court.But the people who wrote the series clearly knew very little about basketball. Weird statements about basic basketball concepts and statistics abound throughout the show, so if you're watching this and you don't know much about basketball, you won't learn anything from this show. In fact, you'll pretty much have the wrong idea.For example, there are statements like ""the average player makes fifty percent of their shots."" Anyone who plays basketball knows that a fifty percent field goal shooter is basically either a center taking nothing but shots next to the basket, or an absolute cold-blooded killer from outside like Ray Allen, Dirk Nowitzki, or Michael Jordan (the last one absolutely murderous from the long 2 point range, normally a very inefficient, undesirable shot that's largely available because defenders want their opponents to take bad shots). The average player in any league except the NBA and Euroleague probably shoots south of forty percent. This observation may seem pedantic, but the entire game of basketball revolves around creating mismatches, and squeezing out good shoots and forcing your opponent to take bad ones. Field goal percentage (and true shooting percentage, OBPM, etc.) is a function of that chess match between opposing teams. This show was set up to brilliantly exploit that with superhuman players.Instead, the action in the game often seems random, you don't get a sense of the back and forth between teams, there's a lot of talk about ""strong"" and ""weak"" when basketball is pretty much a skill game where speed and athleticism are the main skills of players until college and pro level play, where individual strength is important to perform well on defense, and for interior players who are rim protectors.You must be thinking ""it's just an anime, dude."" And that's why you should still watch the show - it's quite fun. It wouldn't be fun to be a replica of actual basketball games, but there's some basic stuff that you have to know to write a story about basketball. It seems to me the writers didn't have that. From mislabeled terms to completely illogical observations about basketball, it can throw off a viewer that either watches basketball regularly or actually played organized ball (in my case, both).A good flick, if predictable and wonky at times.Edit: The best example of how bad Kuroko gets basketball while still being entertaining occurs in the final leg of the series (well, unless there's gonna be another year of high school for these guys). Seiren up 18-15 in the first quarter, yeah? The other team gets a defensive stop on the other end, and they're trying to set up a play to score. Everyone in the crowd, players from defeated teams, all remark ""if X scores now, Seiren is done. Their spirit will be crushed."" *Cough* In the history of basketball, no one has said that about a game in the first quarter, much less about a team that was AHEAD, ever. I could go into why this is the case but I would dare to say that it should be self-evident to people who watch any ball at all. I'm still enjoying myself, but I cringe at the portrayal of basketball. No basic research done whatsoever about the sport by the writers.",5
kurokos-basketball,"I like how Kuroko is more of a shadow that people can easily overlooked but still let people know he's the main character without being all 'in your face' about it which isnt what you see most of the time.Kuroko brings so many light hearted comical scenes into the anime from where he'd just appear out of nowhere or disappear which blends well with Kagami's personality. Such a good anime though, rlly enjoyed it (-;",5
kurokos-basketball,"Daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaam it!Seriously, Kuroko's Basketball is very powerful and adictive drug!Once you reach episode 4 you just can´t stop anymore.The second season is even more impressive. Everything is so over the top, the battles/matches are incredible and the characters are perfect.You just can´t dislike Kuroko, Kyoshi and so many others.You don´t even have to like sports anime to be hooked on this show but if you DO like, well, you´re in for an incredible ride!",5
kurokos-basketball,"Can you answer the question? I've never been into ""Sport Animes"", unless I saw a really cute boy.. then maybe I would check it out. The last one I fully enjoyed was the first and second season of, Prince of Tennis. Kuroko's Basketball makes a bigger impact when it comes to team work, and keeps you on the edge of your seat. I found myself clapping and wanting to cheer on this fictional team that slammed dunked its way into my heart. The animation is amazing, but what really brought me in was the music. It's incredible how much it impacts the anime and keeping you feeling like they have the chance of winning the game. If this anime doesn't make you want to cheer.. then all I have to say is, ""you win some, and you lose some""",5
kurokos-basketball,"The plot of this show is simple, it's pretty much about a basketball team/club from Seirin High School wanting to become the best in Japan. I'm not going to go into depth with the characters or anything because so many people have already done that. What I will say is that despite its simplicity, this show has a really likeable cast of characters. The chemistry between the two key players in Seirin's basketball team, Kuroko and Kagami, is really a pleasure to behold. It's also really cool how their bond develops as the show progresses. So far I bet I'm making this show sound pretty generic though lol. What makes this show so amazing, is the level of energy that this show gives off due to the characters' passion towards basketball and simply because of how insane the basketball games get. I can't explain it but the level of tension in every one of the games sends chills down my spine because of how close some of them are. The opponents Seirin faces also become more and more intimidating as the show goes on making the show's main team always feeling like the underdog. Whenever I watch this I always just get this feeling of euphoria because it just gets me so pumped. In short, this show is simply a blast to watch. I recommend watching it if you are the least bit interested in sports anime.",5
kurokos-basketball,"I am someone who dislikes sport animes. Nor do I write reviews on animes.  However, this anime has kept me on the edge of my seat and wanting more faster than almost every anime out. This is truly an anime that doesn't disappoint.  However, I won't spoil any story for you but, the characters are well made.  The story is well made.  Also, it doesn't fall under the ""ofc the main team wins"" type of story.  Fillers seem to be even kept to a minimum and even with fillers it makes the story much better.  This anime has quickly become a favorite of mine. You don't even have to like sports or sport animes to enjoy this.  I've added this to my list of Anime to recommend to others when asked.",5
kurokos-basketball,"Never have I seen a better anime about the TRUE life of basketball. Kidding, the story is pretty interesting and it creates good cliff-hangers that kept me watching.At times, the show can be a bit ridiculous with the reactions. For example, someone learns a new move and all the sudden it's like they reached a whole new level of basketball never before seen in the history of them playing basketball (Only to have it get crushed, but whatever). This anime is pretty good though, and I'm going to watch it until the end.",5
kurokos-basketball,"Kuroko's basketball is an anime that will surprise you. It takes the idea of high-school basket ball and turns it into a compelling anime with great animation, even greater character, superb pacing, and episodes end on the perfect cliffhangers that will have you consuming episode faster than you can pass a basketball.The show follows Kuroko, a quiet and reserved basketball player who uses his lack of presence on the court and uses misdirection to pass to his teammates unnoticed and unobstructed. When he signs up for a high-school basketball team he meets Kagami, our other main protagonist. Born in Japan but raised and trained in America, he's a hot blooded and loud player who has a seemingly infinite amount of motivation and potential. In middle school, Kuroko was on a legendary team nicknamed ""The Generation of Miracles"". An unstoppable team of basketball prodigies that sent echo's through the basketball scene. Kuroko was one of these prodigies. Now their high-school years came around they all went their separate ways. When Kuroko and Kagami meet, they vow to each other to become the best team in Japan. But can they overcome The Generation of Miracles to achieve this goal?My favorite thing about this anime are the characters. The character in this anime are some of the most well written characters to be seen in a show. From their motives to their doubts. Despite their borderline impossible skill, these characters feel human. They are well developed and it's a treat seeing how they all grow and transform over the course of the show. Each have their own strength and weaknesses and they play off of each other so well. There is a character here for anyone.Pacing is done very well in this show. Interaction's and matches last just the right amount of time as to not seem to long or boring. And I don't know how but some of these episode's manage to end on some of the most perfect cliffhanger that will having  you saying ""Wait...what!?  I need to know what happens next! ""When this show hit you with the big moments, it hits you HARD. The animation is great when it needs to be and it will have you screaming ""YES!"" while fist pumping the air when the big moments happen.Long review short. This is an excellent anime with good pacing, great characters, and edge of your seat basketball. If your not a fan of sport anime's, Kuroko's basketball just might change your mind.",4.5
kurokos-basketball,"This series is so well done that it was able to draw me in from the very beginning despite that I had zero interest in basketball. I find the artwork to be FANTASTIC and the soundtrack to be phenomenal. The characters are a constant powerful presence and a delight to see on screen-- whether their a main character or a supporting one, which is rare in my book. Every episode is full of tension and rivalry, and I always feel pumped up and excited after I've finished watching an episode. I would recommend this anime to just about anyone, but especially people who are competitive and know what it's like to really want to win something.",4.5
kurokos-basketball,"I have to say that I have never shown any interest towards basketball, but I thought; ""hey!  why not try it?""  I am SO glad I thought that!  This show is AMAZING!  I think what drew me to it was that its action-packed, well assorted, and extremely entertaining.  There isn't a single episode that's boring, the plot is well expressed and constant action.  There's tension and build-up to everything, and it's so addictive!  I myself, love sports, and I can influence my own sport (lacrosse) with what I picked up from watching Kuroko.  This is a defiant MUST WATCH!  You won't be disappointed.",4.5
kurokos-basketball,I used to not like sports at all but this anime totally changed my mind. I never thought that I would ever try to understand basketball or any other sport in that matter. If you love basketball then I suggest this anime. If you don't like sports than I'm sure this will change your mind. I was really glad when a new season came out. I can't wait for the next episode. I am totally giving this anime 5 stars.,4.5
kurokos-basketball,"Sports animes are starting to become a trend in most new anime. I was surprised by how well this show was and how I couldn't stop watching. The show has comedy,drama,and good characters in general. This isn't a very fanservice show like free(i actually enjoyed free btw but there is a little not alot) I feel like that comes more from the fans itself. Also the show is really well written especially when most of the episodes are basketball games where each game gets creative where you want to watch the next episode asap. I would give this a three or four episode try if you are curious to watch it and see if it is for you. Im following the second season and can't wait to see more.",4.5
kurokos-basketball,"I have to admit I was a bit skeptical at first when I was about to watch this series, but once I started I simply cannot stop. I watched the whole first season in one go and just cannot stop enjoying or thinking about it for the whole time after I was done watching, the series is good in a way that is rare for anime nowadays it has a great balance between exciting heart-racing matches and original humorous moments. Overall, I really recommend watching this anime whatever your preferences in anime are, you will enjoy this series thoroughly and won't regret watching it at all!",5
kurokos-basketball,"Yea it's true some of the abilities of some characters are unrealistic but its an anime it doesn't meant to be real. The Animation are beyond beautiful, the character development are amazing better then most of the anime I've watched. What I enjoyed the most is the soundtrack, the soundtrack is flawless and each character had their unique personality. This anime taught me Basketball and inspired me to play Basketball it described the roles of each players. Each of the Generation of Miracle had their own unique abilities which describes their roles - Example such as  Midorima he was a Shooting Guard and he's abilities are full court shots. Great Anime I recommended this anime to anyone even if you don't like sports.",5
kurokos-basketball,"When it comes to making a good sports anime, Kuroko's Basketball basically does everything right. It has interesting characters, an interesting story as far as sports animes go, and an intensity that may drop your jaw a couple times. The biggest highlight of the show are the games. They are powerful and energizing to watch. Any shortcomings the anime may have, sometimes were overlooked to me just because the games were just so impressive to see. All the characters seem pretty decently balanced and few feel bland whatsoever. My only gripe is with the character Kuroko. I am not a big fan of the extreme silent and emotionless type characters. They feel to unreal to me and I can't relate to them. His partner makes up for it to a degree, but still it feels like a drag. Despite that, there is little to hate about the series and I look forward to season 2.",5
kurokos-basketball,"I came across this in the manga version first. At first, I thought it wasn't gonna be that great. Then, I saw that it had an anime adaption so I went and try it out. It was a good choice. I was hooked right after watching the 1st episode. Can't wait until Season 2. [It's good enough that I finished both the anime and the manga all in 2 days.] (If you're having doubts that this is not a good series, please give it a try. You never know how much you would like it c;)",5
kurokos-basketball,Yes im a girl and most girls are looking for the romance i'm glad they had a few parts with it!But i love how the show is FUNNY for sure most people like comedy as do I.I'm glad i started reading the anime i was getting caught in class trying to read it on my phone!With this i super excites for the season 2 coming up.Yes they have already announced it but i hope it comes on here as soon as it does in japan i'm a big an and im glad i gave this show a chance so please take the time to watch this anime show i'm sure you will like it ^_^,3
kurokos-basketball,"Kurobasu, like Tenipuri is a typical shonen sports anime, with a cast of pretty boys, crazy moves and deep, meaningful friendships between friends (men) - making it perfect for (BL/yaoi) fangirls.  In addition, the plot is well written, with funny and serious moments, and it's supported by both good dialogue and excellent animation.  Finally, there's some great character development - and it doesn't take 100 episodes to get there (though you might be waiting till season two).",5
kurokos-basketball,"This anime was great for me, there are two main reasons.  In this series they focused on the games rather than the practices like slam dunk would on occasion.  They were fast paced and didn't drag at all.  The second is they build this anime off of a premise that I really enjoyed, the main character isn't your typical genius when it comes to basket ball and has a talent not seen in many now and days.  All and all I definitely suggest this.",5
kurokos-basketball,"I fricken love this anime. I really want to see if they'll come out with a second half to this and carry on into the other two characters they left out, well other than the brief intro in the last episode. So really hoping they carry on. Other than that I really enjoyed this anime and that's coming from someone that's not a fan of sports based animes or even shows themselves but I REALLY enjoy watching main characters build in their strengths and take on the enemy with all they've got. Even if they lose I know that they'll eventually beat them. <3 So hoping a second part to this comes out. It was a really good anime.",5
kurokos-basketball,"I'm not a sporty type of girl. I'm usually a girl that studies and sits with her best friend talking bout some academic. I came across this sport -related anime and I was not disappointed but instead surprised. Kuroko's Basketball never makes me feel bored. It made me feel so agitated and I almost pissed my pants out of anxiousness. I havent watched ""Slam Dunk"" but I found Kuroko's Basketball fairly great!",5
kurokos-basketball,"Kuroko no Basuke has everything a typical sports shounen manga/anime should consist of: rivalry, friendship, trials, humor, power-ups, a hint of girls, special moves, a bada$$ boss etc.... The main difference--or in this case, the twist--between Kuroko no Basuke and others is that the protagonist chooses to act like a sidekick. As the summary explains, Kuroko is portrayed not as a light but as a shadow. However, our attention never strays from Kuroko despite this; after all, we are here to read about Kuroko's Basketball (the basketball which Kuroko plays). Every character is loveable, each having their own individual personalities and traits. Kuroko's deadpan behavior or Kise's easy-to-tease personality are some examples.The anime is well executed and the music is unbelievably exciting and dramatic. I'd recommend listening to the character's songs if time permits it. Also the anime stays true to the manga.At any rate, I love the story and its characters and would definitely recommend it to any readers who are currently into sports. Especially if you are looking for something to inspire you to try or get back into, basketball; just keep in mind that Kuroko no Basuke is fictional so moves like misdirection, Hawk Eye or the bend-and-shoot that Aomine/Kise do is most likely impossible to emulate. Yeah, I know, reality sucks.",5
kurokos-basketball,"I'm not usually a fan of sports anime, but every now and then one comes along that catches my interest.  I am happy to say that Kuroko's Basketball is one of those titles.  At first I was hesitant to watch the series because of the fact that I'm not usually drawn to a sports anime.  What made me change my mind?  I remembered how much I played basketball for fun, and a year in school, and I was suddenly drawn to check out the series.  Weird I know, but sometimes childhood memories are good for getting you to check out something in which you never saw yourself watching, I guess.  I started out watching episode one, and then before I knew it I was already on the seventh episode in the same day.  Normally I try to limit myself to watching no more than five episodes a day, and so I was shocked that I had gotten so hooked on one series that it caused me to forget about my daily anime limit.  Seeing as close as I was to catching up I went ahead and finished the remaining episodes in the same day.  I figured what was another two or three episodes, and besides the show was pretty exciting to watch.  I loved every minute of each and every episode.  Watching the members of the Seirin team each match through a mix of hard work and excellent teamwork never fails to keep me cheering for each and every member of the team.  Kuroko may only have one skill, but the way he passes the ball around has proven more than once to be a huge asset to the team.  It's proof that sometimes even the so-called 'weaker' players can be a huge help.  Also it tells me to always be careful and never underestimate anyone by appearances alone.  The cast of characters is great, and I can easily find something to like about each and every one of them.  The games are intense, and I have found myself on the edge of my seat a few times already.  Animation wise it is a beautiful show to watch, with great character designs and high attention to detail.  I look forward to watching the rest of the series, and cheering for Seirin to win it all.  It made me fall in love with basketball all over again, and I never expected that to happen from watching anime.  Kuroko's Basketball is quickly growing to become one of my favorite sports anime.  The last sports series that kept my attention like this was Prince of Tennis, and only time will tell whether or not Kuroko's Basketball will prove to be better than that title or not.",5
kurokos-basketball,"Kuroko's Basketball is about the graduates of a middle school team that consisted of five very special players, known as the Generation of Miracles.  These five players have separated and went to different schools, all five chose a top school to go to.  But their schools is not what this anime is about.Open to Seirin High School, a school opened only one year before in which the basketball team had made it to the championship but were completely outclassed.  The team is looking for new members for the year and we see a tall and powerfully built American basketball player, Kagami, who joins the club, but then mysteriously they notice another form on the  table with the note ""I have been here the whole time"" on it.  The team captain and coach look at the letter and see that the kid must have been with the Generation of Miracles.  During practice, the coach who has a special skill at judging player's skill and potential, looks through the line of members, but do not seem to notice Kuriko standing at the end of the line...There are surprises with all the characters as you watch...So check out Kuroko's Basketball if you.- Love sports animes.- Love a great plot and story.- Love character development.",5
kurokos-basketball,"I've never been a big fan of sports anime and never really been excited when watching it. However... I absolutely love Kuroko's Basketball. I get excited each episode and every game. I never knew an anime basketball game could make you so excited. I don't even get excited during actual basketball games. So even if you aren't a fan of sports anime, you should definitely check it out. I can nearly guarantee that you will get into it. There's something happening each episode and at the end of each episode I know you'll be looking forward to more. Kuroko, one of the main male leads, is definitely a unique main character. He isn't overly strong or a powerhouse basketball player. He's weak really but his passing skills are amazing. However, his personality is awesome. He isn't snobbish or a scaredy-cat and is actually quite modest and confident without it being overdone. He's even a bit funny. He lack of facial expressions and how he expresses himself in such a monotone is pretty funny. The other main lead, Kagami, is awesome. He's a powerhouse and an amazing basketball player. When he's teamed up with Kuroko they're nearly unstoppable. He gets overly excited about basketball games against players that are believed to be stronger than himself. He actually likes playing basketball more when there's a chance he could lose. Another character I find interesting is the main girl, who is the coach. She is actually a pretty good anime female. She isn't extremely bossy nor does she blush all the time. She's more of an average girl, but with the love for basketball and good scouting skills when checking out the basketball players. I rarely like anime girls, but I don't mind her at all. The other characters all have unique personalities and distinguished attributes. On team Seiren, I'm pretty sure there wouldn't be anyone you dislike or find annoying. They're all very cool and funny in their own way. The animation and character design is very good. There's a lot of cute guys in here, that I'm sure will get plenty of girls hooked in it. The bond between Kuroko and Kagami is interesting to watch. It's a unique friendship with both of them helping each other out. I'm sure you'll enjoy watching this show as do I.",5
kurokos-basketball,In the past month ive tried anime because of twitch prime. I decided on this because i like bball so id like to list things i enjoyed about it-cool characters-cool pre and post stories-i love the intense moments that are interrupted by something dumb-i love the odd skills of the GOM-the main characters didnt just instantly win they lost in the “main” tournament I didnt like-buzzerbeating dunks id prefer meteor jam because i could imagine it happening sonce a buzzer beating dunk is impossible -i dont like fan service because its weird to look at in general so i didnt enjoy any of itOverall very good show would recommend 10/10,5
kurokos-basketball,"The series starts off by showing the main character(Kuroko) in a sort of intro. Through this intro we get to see that he played for a godlike basketball team (Teiko) that was commonly called the ""Generation Of Miracles"". The segment at the start of every episode is sort of a prologue intro for the series.. followed by a generic anime intro that just shows of the characters.. The intro's in this series are overall pretty good. It's important to note that this story takes place in Japan. The main characters are: Kuroko Tetsuya and Kagami Taiga (The dynamic duo)If we skip forward a bit we get to see Kuroko traning with his new team; Seirin High. He surprises everyone by showing of (Or rather the opposite) his skills at passing and going by undetected. This scene is really awesome. The way they make the basketball matches seem so intense is what really makes this show stand out for me. Seeing people like Kagami and Aomine going toe to toe with eachother in a full on zone battle really gets your blood rushing.. almost like you are there witnessing it or even playing with them. Without spoiling anything im just gonna say: The animation is top notch. I love the art style. The characters feels fleshed out and not lacking in any aspects. The way they make you want to see more and more is ridiculous and the show is overall fantastic in my opinion.I highly recommend this show to any new (and old) anime fans.Link for a list of all the characters:  http://kurokonobasuke.wikia.com/wiki/Characters",5
kurokos-basketball,"Honestly, I've never been a huge fan of sports. Kuroko's Basketball hyped me up so much because I wanted them to win so bad but I also wanted the other characters to also win. It was just a huge mix of emotions and was very entertaining to watch. It's also one of the first sports anime I've watched and it's made me want to watch other sports anime that have come out or are going to come out.I also think others who aren't into sports would enjoy this show.",5
kurokos-basketball,Kuroko no Basuke is a fun show and really hypes you up and will get you into team sports. It's fun characters and comic relief is amazing and just trust me when I say that you have to watch it to understand how amazing it is!!! I've probably rewatched this show at least 3 times and find myself laughing while enjoying its serious parts all the time!! It's incredibly fun to find out the strategies that they use to defeat the other team and how they overcome their challenges!!,5
kurokos-basketball,"The anime was a bit too cheesy to take seriously. It was hard to say whether this was an anime about talented basketball players or talented, magical basketball players. Unless there is magic involved then: you cannot see ""The Zone"", you cannot evaluate people's fitness by just looking at them, you do not have an ""Emperor Eye"" or ""Eagle Eye"", there is no ""Zone beyond The Zone"". They're good metaphors, albeit cheesy, but they aren't consistent with the reality I'm presented in this anime. Maybe if the anime had premised itself by saying there was some intuitive force moving through certain players then it would have been less cheesy.A lot of the games were predictable and recycled. I know it's hard to invent something else, but most of the games were the same old buzzer beaters, being beaten at the start but then revealing some special move to comeback and win the game. And this is repeated many episodes in a row during the Winter Cup. If there were any other teams Seirin had to beat then I would have probably stopped watching.The other thing to say is that not many of the characters were developed very well. It was a short anime and most of the characters were only developed for about 5 mins. I hardly even knew the names of some of the characters that played for Seirin. For example, Koganei wasn't developed until the last game with Rakuzan. He was on the team the whole time but I hardly knew him at all. Compared to an anime like Haikyuu which I would give a 4/5, this anime is a 3/5.This kind of anime is fine if it's the first time you've watched something like this (it might give you a few feels), but if you've watched a couple before you will realise how generic it is. The premise of the anime was interesting at first but before long I realised it was quite generic.",5

kurokos-basketball,"There are 3 seasons so far but really they just flow into one another. This show has comedy good animation and interesting characters.The 1 problem i have with this anime is that some of the characters are really good and others are meh. I don't get how a guy on the best teams is just a decoy...but hes really bad. All sports anime seem to follow and certain formula.Small player with few skills but really good at one thing. Meets an rival that makes them better, whether on the team or not they make each other better. But not good enough because the teams missing players. Thats when the upperclassman shows up and the team is now way better.That being said. I like Kuroko's. But the reason its an 8/10 is due to the dragging on DBZ affect of some of the games. Literally some of the episodes are inner player monologue for like 5 mins then shot to some else then the same thing. That can get annoying",5
kurokos-basketball,"I can't even truly express the joy I received from watching this anime. Before this my top anime was Death Note. I thought it was brilliant and well made, but I was wrong. The writing in comparison to Kuroko no Basket is light year's away in balance, strategy, attention clenching, and execution.I completely hate sports; I don't even watch them or play them even though I used to play sports. Basketball was my least favorite of all sports. So when I saw this anime I skipped over it for nearly 2 years. Watching this anime was highly rewarding.Kuroko no Basket has complex strategy which I love in anime such as Death Note. It also has outstanding art, and dynamic characters. For an anime with 70+ episodes it has done a wonderful job. It director deserves an Oscar! or His own company if he already doesn't have it. Ever episode leaves you wanting more.The pacing in the matches are done so flawlessly.The flashbacks and fillers are short and relevant everytime.The power plays and skill upgrades are realistic and invigorating.Every character is written with surmountable care and consideration.The strategy's are well throughout that even I, a strategist, only predicted 3 this whole anime.And finally this show has caused me to love basketball; I don't even view it the same. In fact I have learned more than any coach could show me just thru observation.I demand you and find it meet for those who have not watched this anime to watch it; right now. This anime is the standard we anime watchers should demand from our 日本人(Japanese) writers to imitate. This is why I watch anime and why I love it. Now stop reading this and watch it! P.s Seirin, FIGHT!",5
kurokos-basketball,"Honestly, I had been avoiding this anime like the plague after hearing of it. I mean ""An anime about basketball?"", I thought. ""Seriously?"" I assumed, like many, that it would be boring and would probably have to add some crazy supernatural element to make the anime even remotely exciting.When a friend of mine cosplayed as Kuroko at a con, I was suprised that he had watched it and I asked him about it. Even then, the brief summary he gave still didn't really excite me but I suddenly questioned my initial judgement and thought I might give it a go.And boy...did I give it a go.It was a couple of weeks ago that I watched that first episode and I just finished the first series last night and shall be starting the next tonight I'm sure. I don't know how to explain the way that the show draws you in but I think it's a combination of the sheer determination of the characters combined with the variety of skills that are actually involved in the basketball they play, without even having to add in any ridiculous supernatural powers to make it unbelievable and hard to relate to.This show is not only compelling to watch but it is genuinely inspiring and that's something that is often hard to find in anime nowadays.I am so glad I gave it a chance and I recommend you do the same.",5
kurokos-basketball,Okay a couple of months ago i ran across this and was like ew sports anime? eh why the hell not might as well watch it bc my other shows were still on wait for the next episode.. so i start this up and was blown away at how amazing it was! A must watch one of my favorite anime and its a sports anime !! if u have any interest in basketball or great character development in an anime... then this is for u please do yourself a favor and watch this you will not regret it!!!,5
kurokos-basketball,"Basketball has always competed for my favorite sport along side baseball this anime does the sport justice.  The imposing presence of the generation of miracles is great.  The team work you get with Seirin is great.  As the series progresses you get to see the opponents of Seirin (the generation of miracles) get developed more than some of the members of Seirin it self and it gives you a great inside look on why they didn't join the same team in high school, why Kuroko is so determined to beat his old teammates, and why each of the generation of miracles players are the way they are.  Characters rule in this anime which makes a story about a under dog team climbing the latter so much better.",5
kurokos-basketball,"I'm not the best judge on this, since I haven't watched very many sports anime. In fact the only ones I've looked at briefly so far are baby steps, prince of tennis, haikyuu, yowamushi pedal, and free (yes, i know!) which of course have nothing to do with basketball. But I must say that Kuroko no basket is by far the best sports anime I have watched and to be honest my most favourite anime right now. Im not saying girls don't watch sports anime at all but I do say if you are one of those girls that are into shoujo and the other female orientated anime then this is a good show to get you into different genres as it has plenty of good looking male characters who we can take a fancy too. Also it is one of those animes where the main protagonist isn't primarily the leading role, which I love as we get to deeply explore characters who equally make the show an interesting watch and just as importantly divulge into the connections that bring all the characters together.I know that KnB might not be the best show to learn about basketball but its just a fun show that allows our minds to plunge into a fantastic world where athletes can have supernatural powers and play sports. Because, wouldn't it be awesome to be able to be the that bad-ass on a court without taking steroids!With its serious but just as prominent amusing aspects this anime is an all rounder; with its designs, story and  character personality. I recommend all you bored people to watch it because I can tell you, you'll be up all night!",5
kurokos-basketball,"I've never fallen for a show so fast or so hard before! This is the first sports anime I've ever watched - honestly I was just looking for a new show to get into, and since it had a lot of episodes I figured it had to be good to get a second and third season. I wasn't sure how I felt about it at first, but after the first few episodes I was hooked. I am obsessed with the characters - especially Kuroko-chan, squeeeee! - and find myself squealing and cheering them on for every episode. It seriously keeps you on the edge of your seat! It's the perfect combination of bromance, action, hard work, and friendship to keep you interested, and the anime itself is just beautifully put together. The cliff hangers, the build-ups, the let downs, the feels - everything blends together perfectly. I LOVE KUROKO'S BASKETBALL! ^_____^",5
kurokos-basketball,"Until recently, I'd never really watched a sports anime.  Kuroko's Basketball was among a group of anime recommended to me and I instantly fell in love.The anime was face paced enough to hold my attention, as well as great at revealing aspects of a sport that I know very little about.  It was great to see the characters grow and how basketball could be played in very different ways depending on each individual's strengths and weaknesses.  I truly look forward to seeing the next season and it has encouraged me to dive deeper into the world of sports anime.",5
kurokos-basketball,"I love basket ball and this makes me love it more! Guys and Girls can both watch this and both enjoy it equally. This isnt very cliche like them winner every single match, they have some bumps and challenges they have to go through to become the best in Japan. Although its not THAT realistic to real life people can still relate to the characters and have a 'bond' with the characters. This anime shows character development for most characters which is always cool to see. Cant wait for season 3",5
kurokos-basketball,"I love the mix of personalities, teamwork, and competition in this sports anime. It had just the right amount of humor and story-pacing too. This series hits those notes well. Well, the FIRST season does at least.The second season would be perfect except for one thing: the games are taking too long. Seriously, basketball has 48 minutes of actual game play and yet they're devoting 5+ episodes for it. That's over 125 minutes for just game play in one game, not even counting halftime or fouls and the like!! I realize this is a weakness a lot of sports anime suffer from. But still, I don't like having to sit through 25 minutes of what amounts to inner character dialog and  game play ""revelations"". (Have they learned nothing from Dragon Ball Z??) I don't want to wait for 3 seasons just to find out whether they win or lose the Winter Cup, but at the rate they're going that's exactly what'll happen!It's really just a shame too. If they condensed the games, the story would be a lot more interesting. But as it is, I've gotten in the habit of not watching this serious for weeks at a time just so I can skip all the ""filler"" episodes.",5
kurokos-basketball,"Don't get me wrong this is a great anime. Its exciting, kinda a different genre for shonen jump, and it has a variety of characters. But when it comes to basketball it can mislead a lot of non sports fans that watch this. I have played basketball since I could walk and I have became a student of the game so when I see some of the things that go on on this anime I cant help but laugh. For an example: they talk about how Kagami has only a certain amount of jumps in one game. In real life basketball there is no way that a player could tell his coach he only has 5,6, or 7 jumps left. The player would just keep jumping as if he is not tired.Another example is Kuroko's vanishing drive........ if you have never played basketball or have not played seriously, stuff like this does not exist. There is no way that players can have almost superpowers like the characters in this anime. I no I have been rambling but I still think this show is great. They way the writers made the show makes complete since because if it just showed regular real basketball it would not be as entertaining to non sports fans. OH! and my last complaint, why do the players in this show score on their defender the have a conversation with them for like 5mins while the game is supposed to be going on? Do the referees not care that the players waste at least 10 mins a game starring down each other or talking shonen jump basketball philosophy in the middle of the court?",5
kurokos-basketball,"Kuroko's Basketball change my outlook on sport animes forever! I always thought that sport animes would be boring but after hearing about Kuroko in the Crunchyroll News a few times, I finally decided to give it a shot! I was hooked after watching 3 episodes and now I'm a sport anime fan! Both Season 1 and 2 are awesome and filled with action and character development! Kuroko's Basketball is easily in my top 3 fav sport animes: 1. Kuroko's Basket, 2. Free! Iwatobi Swim Club, and 3. Yowapeda. If you aren't sure if you'll like sport anime, then you should check out Kuroko's Basketball! It will change your outlook on sport animes!",5
kurokos-basketball,"To be honest, I really hate basketball. I almost passed up this anime and didn't watch it. I'm so glad I didn't. This is one of the best anime I've ever seen. It has the super intense scenes, and the lighthearted scenes. This is one of the only anime that I actually keep up with. Seriously, why are you reading this when you are wasting precious time where you could be watching it! So glad I didn't skip over it. The games make me yell at my screen the entire time and it's great. I love watching an anime where I get super into it. In my opinion, that's a sign of a darn good anime right there.",5
kurokos-basketball,"Me being a basketball player  really enjoyed this anime. I mean the animation, the storyline, ect. is just flat out amazing. The whole idea of it is just amazing. Now some of my friends that are on my team claim the ""Zone"" is unrealistic but it actually is real and it does happen. Not saying the things come out of your eyes and un-natural jumping abilities but any way it does happen. Back to the review yea is amazing.",5
konosuba-gods-blessing-on-this-wonderful-world,"This is absolutely fantastic. The show doesn't take itself entirely too seriously and the characters are really likeable! It gives off an SOA impression but in my opinion has been started off with a much better stage for character development and improvement. I find myself actually wanting to see the characters level up and go on quests. This is going to be an amazing ride, so log on and get ready to grind...you wont be disappointed! -Wafflez",4.5
konosuba-gods-blessing-on-this-wonderful-world,"This is a definitely a neat show. I have only watched a few episodes so far (3) but I particularly adore them because I am a wizard and magic fanatic. This is a show that gives you an interesting world full of epicness and awe yet with characters who are very entertaining. It is nice to see a magic-genre show because there is so much potential creativity that can be put into it. However, it is difficult to find material like this nowadays. It is as if God came and threw this into my face--and I am thankful for it. I would absolutely recommend this show to friends. I hope season three will be in production soon because it is explosive--in a good way!",5
konosuba-gods-blessing-on-this-wonderful-world,"Im Updating my review after watching many episodes of this, by far this and gate are my favorite shows I look forward to every week, its set in an alternate world with rpg like characters, its more of a comedy than anything else but has some plot to it which is nice keeps it from going garbage, if you've seen a other rpg anime's you'll probably enjoy this a lot, personally after watching grimgar of fantasy and ashe for half season i wanted to shoot myself it was epic depressing, this is a good alternate to bring you back from watching that.",5
konosuba-gods-blessing-on-this-wonderful-world,"Just as murphy's law states, anything that could go wrong will go wrong, and that's basically what this anime entails. The main character although some may argue a visionary of some sorts spends more time going backwards than forwards. In hopes of starting anew he quickly finds the struggles to move forward, with each member similar to an anchor rather than a support system. But this anime is hilarious, and I would suggest to anybody looking for a good laugh. For people who seek plot development maybe not the best choice",5
konosuba-gods-blessing-on-this-wonderful-world,"Konosuba is a really interesting series, cause it has all the ingredients to be a typical generic LN adaptation (highschool protagonist, fantasy world, ""harem-esque"" cast), and yet it strikes a weird, wonderful balance between just that and greatness. First and foremost, Kazuma, the MC, is a total loser, even in the way he arrives in the fantasy world. Unlike your usual LN main character, he isnt cool, he isnt strong, and he certainly isnt charismatic or nice (well, hes nice sometimes but hes still a bit of a jerk). All of these traits make Kazuma a breath of fresh air concerning protagonists. I wont go too much into detail about the rest of the cast other than saying that their a bunch of idiots in the most endearing and fun way (like, literally according to the show they have low intelligence). This show is all around hilarious and endearing.Oh, also, its animated by studio Deen so naturally it doesnt have the best animation, however, dare I say, the janky animation adds to the greatness.At least give it a shot! It stands apart from the horde of terrible light novel trash.",5
konosuba-gods-blessing-on-this-wonderful-world,"This review comes after watching the first two episodes. This has a somewhat cliched premise but takes it in a fresh direction for the genre. It appears to be set up as a harem (as evidenced by the poster and it's common in the genre), but thus far it's not overly sexual and all of the girls don't seem to be overly impressed by every kind or heroic thing our protagonist does. The show is heavy on comedy with very nice visuals and little action. The magic/special power sequences are really cool! There is a lot of variety in character design and so far, the characters have vastly different personalities that don't rely so much on tropes. While they have some novelty to them, they don't seem too over-the-top. Our goddess isn't a total mess up and has her own adjustments to make, which sets the story up for some nice character development all across the board. They do a good job of weaving in explanations about the way the world works without the overuse of long monologues and thus far, have a pace that is somewhat slow without crawling while remaining thoroughly entertaining. This is definitely one of my top five this season! I can't wait to see what this new mc is like next week!",5
konosuba-gods-blessing-on-this-wonderful-world,"Very funny and enjoyable series. Come for the laughs. Not to take seriously.Speaking of not taking it seriously. You shouldn't expect fast pace plot arc either. The whole point of this show is that they don't really get anywhere and the party is mostly useless. THATS THE JOKE. Any review on here bagging on the show because the girls are stupid or the plot moves too slow/doesn't exists is completely missing the point of this show.The characters somewhat represent bad MMO players that level in foolish ways. For example a tank that cant hit anything, or a mage that levels ONLY explosion magic and cant move for 24 hours after 1 spell due to low mana pool. Anyway the whole point of this show is the characters are stupid. The struggle is funny AND THAT IS THE POINT. Probably not a very enjoyable show for most girls. But would probably make most any guy ROFL at many points.",5
konosuba-gods-blessing-on-this-wonderful-world,"Surrender!Surrender!...In all seriousness this anime caught me by surprise, when I saw first saw it, I at first thought ""great... it's one of THOSE animes"" and was about to write it off, but the surprisingly competent comedic writing pulled me in. It does have a few low points, but over all I highly recommend it if you're a long standing fan of fantasy setting anime or comedy that is actually written and timed well (a surprising rarity in anime). Is it as funny as the legendary gintama? Don't be ridiculous... You can't compare anything to that masterpiece. But it is however written in such a way that the characters truly shine and it feels more natural and less like [insert cliche here for comedic affect]. Back to the low points, it's art style is nice (if a little generic), but the actual animation suffers from Generic anime syndrome where certain frames are jarring but it overall keeps a good consistency (Not to be confused with long running shonen anime syndrome, where the quality of animation drop significantly often as time goes on). The fan service is not a constant thing in the show, but it's enough to probably put off some people and sometimes doesn't mix well with the writing. Music suffers from uninspired generic fantasy anime syndrome, where often times you could swear that this is the exact same soundtrack as some other anime, but that really doesn't matter. To wrap up, the anime has fantastic writing, the characters really shine through, but a lot of it feels generic when it comes to styling and sound design. This is honestly a very solid series that I hope improves over time, give it a chance!",4
konosuba-gods-blessing-on-this-wonderful-world,"This by far became one of my favorite series of all time. Kazuma is a pitiful, unfortunate guy, until he gets resurrected into a parallel world. However, unlike a lot of Isekai protagonists who are overpowered, Kazuma has to start with almost nothing (though some rightfully argue that he's partly to blame).The story is incredibly well-written. The way everything goes from A to B to C to D and back to A again is beautiful. Sometimes it takes 3 episodes to come together. You can think ""why is this seemingly unrelated filler episode here?"" and then ""bam!"" It hits you. That episode that felt like filler had a lot of important things happen. My favorite part is that Kazuma is the brains of the operation. He can't fight with brute force, or extreme powers. He has to rely on his party, who are completely unbalanced and very difficult to work with. If he gets into trouble by himself (or due to his party members), he has to use his brain and luck to get himself out of the situation. Kazuma is also sarcastic, but it's in a way that the viewer relates to him. He feels like he's in a crappy situation, and you know why he's this way. He's sarcastic, but not just because he's an asshole. It also feels like he's the kind of guy that screws around playing a tabletop RPG, but in a fun way",5
konosuba-gods-blessing-on-this-wonderful-world,"So I've been watching anime for around 20 years and Konosuba quickly became my absolute favorite.  At the time of writing it has 4.7 out of 5 stars on ratings, which is very high for any anime; most of the negative reviews are troll comments or the handful of people who don't get the humor.  All of the characters are terrible people; yet while they are mean to each other you can tell they truly care about one another.",5
konosuba-gods-blessing-on-this-wonderful-world,"I heard the hype, so I lowered my expectations. But I found the hype didn't go far enough. Konosuba was one of the most enjoyable anime series I have seen since the start of the new millenium. It does something most animes today fail at completely; it doesn't take itself too seriously. Take a bunch of goof-ball characters, throw in some madcap situations, add a dash of unpredictability and VOILA! Laugh your butt off as these characters somehow manage to inexplicably pull off the impossible. Usually despite, not because of themselves. They are all so flawed, they seem like real people and after a while I found I couldn't help myself. I had to keep rooting for them. The plot is a little thin in places, but it is there. The writing keeps things moving along well in a lighthearted vein, but there's some tension and distress to keep it real. Problems are overcome but usually not in the apparent manner you would expect. There's some good direction to keep everything pulling in the same direction and to keep the whole thing from spinning off into oblivion. One of the things that really helped this along, was the Japanese voice acting. I don't speak Japanese, but it was even apparent to me that the actors and actresses just nailed almost every episode with their work. You don't HAVE to know what the words mean to tell what's going on. But keep those subtitles handy anyway! I really, really wish I could give this 4 1/2 stars. It would be a 92/100 for me. If you are simply tired of the heavy-handedness, or the self-importance, of so many anime titles out there today, and you want a breath of fresh air, give Konosuba a try. But if you find your sides are getting a little sore from laughing at it, don't say I didn't warn you!",4
konosuba-gods-blessing-on-this-wonderful-world,"Do not take this isekai seriously, seriously.Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hide The main character is a shut in... he dies and gets transferred over to another world, just to have a useless goddess, a low stamina magician, and a hentai warrior. But that's what makes this anime so great. You would expect this OP main character who gets transferred over to another world; to find an equally awesome party to travel to world in hopes to find world peace. RIGHT? Nopeee. Not Konosuba. Are you in for a good time? Do you want a good laugh? Do you want to watch some cute girls ruin the protagonist's life?? Watch Konosuba.",4.5
konosuba-gods-blessing-on-this-wonderful-world,"Excellent sense of humor, and peerlessly great at displaying comedic interactions and expressions between the characters. The character personalities are fleshed out and interesting, and interact in the most satisfying ways. Plot, dialogue, pacing, ALL perfect. The animation is absolutely perfect for this style of show. More people need to see this show. It''s one of my all time favorite anime. All the cleverness of Gintama with a more modern style.",4.5
konosuba-gods-blessing-on-this-wonderful-world,"To make the story small.... If you wan't to have a good time with friends, and if they like Anime. You should watch this Anime with them. Hey even if you don't like Anime, this will still make you laugh a lot. One of my friends didn't like Anime ""past tense"". But now he does from watching this Anime. He said he was going to watch it a sec time :P. But that's just my friend. Maybe you should show your friends, and see what will happens. Go for it lol",5
konosuba-gods-blessing-on-this-wonderful-world,My friend recommended Konosuba to me and I was hooked from just watching the first episode. I shamelessly binged all 20 episodes in about a day with no regrets. The show is taking a whole new(well at least for me) approach in anime comedy. The show revolves around four main characters that each have their own comedic personality. Aqua is hilarious in her dumb moments while she gets roasted by Kazuma. I don't want to spoil too much but if you have the time watch the first episode and give this show a shot.,5
konosuba-gods-blessing-on-this-wonderful-world,"Hahaha I've laughed so hard watching Konosuba; this show is very brilliant, funny, and cute, if you're in for some hilariously dumb scenes (and characters of course) this would be the perfect anime for you :D, it may seem a bit slow after the first episode but it picks up after that and ahhhh there are just so many little things that are awesome about this show but I can't spoil it soooo -- can't wait for season 3!",4
konosuba-gods-blessing-on-this-wonderful-world,"Konosuba is a comedy/RPG Parody about a shut in guy who dies upon venturing out into the world. Upon his death he is asked by a goddess to be reincarnated into another world to help save it. He can request any one thing to being with him in order to help him with this quest. He requests the goddess herself. Hilarity ensues.The characters all have their place and very funny. First you have the protagonist, who has no special talents, is under-geared and is the type of character in an MMORPG that you would pick for a raid if you were desperate for bodies, but not if you needed anything specific. Then you have a Priestess/Healer who is highly skilled, but dumber than a rock, has no attention span at all and causes more trouble than she helps. She is the type that gets picked up instantly for a Raid, but after getting everyone killed over and over, never gets invited back. You also have a Mage/DPS who is so over focused on one skill that she has no flexibility or stamina at all. She looks good on paper and has good gear for a Raid, but because she can't Crowd Control, do light DPS or even survive a fight she also will never be asked back. Finally you have a Knight/Tank that can take one hell of a beating but can not hold agro to save her life. Another with great gear and stats, but once the fight starts she can not hit the target and she creeps the enemy out so much that they will go out of their way to avoid her. So another that would never be invited back to a Raid. Somehow they all end up together and try to make it work.This show isn't very deep, but a lot deeper than expected.  The interaction between these misfits parallels Book Smart, Over Specialized, Incompetent and Under-specialized professionals you would find in the real world. If you have played an MMO or RPG before you will find it highly entertaining.",5
konosuba-gods-blessing-on-this-wonderful-world,"When I first saw this series, I thought it was going to be another generic RPG anime. While I was right on most parts, I was not expecting this.Konosuba follows Kazuma, a NEET who, after being killed, is given the opportunity to be sent to another world by the goddess Aqua, along with one other thing. After mocking him for his death, Kazuma gets revenge on Aqua by having his ""one thing"" be her and together they are sent on a mission to defeat the world's Demon King. By the first episode, I was laughing like crazy. While this series isn't plot heavy, it makes up for it with it's outrageous comedy. Every episode had me laughing. From it's ridiculous and unexpected situations to it's hilarious dialogue. I HIGHLY recommend this series if you enjoy Comedy and Fantasy setting anime and just want to have a good time. Would avoid if you're looking for a story rich anime.",5
konosuba-gods-blessing-on-this-wonderful-world,As of recent release Ep.3Highly Recommended! :)If you're a fan of DanMachi or any other series that revolves around a character which is just starting out in the very beginning of a life as an adventurer(Very similar to DanMachi or SAO but not with OP abilities).. then this is for you.The very top trait of the series for me was the Humor. Excelente! 11/10.Hope you guys give the series a try!,5
konosuba-gods-blessing-on-this-wonderful-world,"From what ive seen so far this is the most normal and fun of all the ""RPG"" animes. No overpowered MC with ultra sword skills or ultra strategy, just an average guy that got sucked into this world. So far im liking the relationship he shares with the goddess, and im fine with him having all girls with him. However if they all start to fall in love with him and he starts to act clueless and is super standoffish (like every Harem anime in existence) then im gonna burn down the writers home for ruining this beautiful animes",4
konosuba-gods-blessing-on-this-wonderful-world,"A fresh take on the overused fantasy (isekai) setting with 4 loveable main characters (jerk, idiot, chuuni, perv) and great side characters, the interactions are awesome, very funny and very memeable (see r/Animemes).Goddess I love this show, this is the best comedy show I have ever watched!P.S. Kazuma is the best guy in all harem, more relatable compared to rest of mostly dense/beta MC, and yearn for true gender equality too!",5
konosuba-gods-blessing-on-this-wonderful-world,"This show is how a comedy is supposed to be done! The whole first season is extremely funny, the whole time i laughed my ass off. This is the first comedy anime that made me want to sit down and watch it as fast as i could. Not only is it extremely funny but the fan service is pretty good, be careful though because this is not a show that you would want to watch while in a public place (just watch it in your bedroom).",4
konosuba-gods-blessing-on-this-wonderful-world,"I saw some memes about this show and it sparked my curiosity. By the 2nd episode I was hooked. I absolutely adore how well written these characters are, The raunchy, naughty, blunt and witty humor this anime has is endless. Every character (even the secondary ones) offer a perfect blend of interaction and help each other drive the plot (if you can even call it that) which leaves you wanting more. Its a shame theres only two seasons but I hope we can all make the movie a success so we can get a S3 and maybe S4. Theres so much more potential this anime has.  This anime isnt meant to be taken seriously. Leave your ego at the door, kick your feet back and be prepared to blush, shake your head and have some hearty laughs.",5
konosuba-gods-blessing-on-this-wonderful-world,"IT IS ONE OF THE BEST ANIME I'VE EVER SEEN. This show is a diamond in the rough for the Isekai genre. Usually, from what I've seen, this genre is very forced upon viewers, not only the genre itself but the aspects inside the show. The comedy in this anime is just down right funny, it is rarely forced upon the viewer and it is just unique. The character development is also on it's own level. Usually the MC of these types of shows is an over-powered, feared by all, tough-guy. The MC in this show is the complete opposite, sarcastic, misogynistic in a way, and sort of an idiot. He gives a rat's a** about his team because they are all stupid, but at the same time still cares for them, in total adding more humor into the show and more character development. Pros:1.) Very good story line, unique to the genre and many good arcs2.) A great tale about comradery and sticking together even though you all are low tier fu***.3.) Good artwork, basic animation but the expressions on their faces brings out a new form of emotion and development. The subtle hints in the character expression can bring out so much more during a scene, I haven't seen anything else like it.4.) EEEXXXPLOOSIION \Cons:1.) Need season 3 (can't wait for movie though)2.) I feel like a lot of the backstories could have been covered way better, like the whole reason why the MC is transported to a new land (IK it was covered a bit, but like why is it a thing).3.)  Where are Aqua's panties? Overall rating: 9.5/10",4.5
konosuba-gods-blessing-on-this-wonderful-world,"Overall the show is pretty darn good. It's very compelling and keeps you interested, it never lags in momentum. Unfortunately there were some parts I found myself cringing just because the writers/animators chose to add in unnecessary parts that took away from the actual story line, mostly just for shock factor. But aside from those moments I really enjoyed it. It's a very funny easy going show that allows you to just sit back and laugh.",4.5
konosuba-gods-blessing-on-this-wonderful-world,"Never mind the review title, but to explain: it was much funnier than expected and I feel content after watching it.Minor spoilers to show disdain in features. Spoilers are marked.The show is a really great anime. I saw an ad for it and was kind of curious of how it would turn out. (Ad: explains that he is resurrected into a fantasy world).The characters are really vibrant and I really liked them. Criticism: The show length is pretty good. It got two seasons, with what I consider minimal episodes to each season. Maybe they could have stretched out the seasons in order to get the viewers accustomed to the characters, but especially the world. Instead of 'Oh yeah, we met this XYZ because ABC.'(how they introduced a main/side character, or not show ability being gained) It could have been a solid half episode; with the pace this show took. As for the world, we could have gotten an idea of what the world consists of: abilities, enemies, map, and what not.Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hide I seem to be more hung up on the abilities, and why protaganist seemed to be the only one that had a variety of them. They seem low level at the very beginning but somehow pass a huge power curve and have no problem with about half of the great evil leaders. Yet they still have no idea how to handle giant frogs, sprites, or tedious things. I had the show at 5/5 but even writing this review brought it to a 4/5 because of hindsight. The show seems ""broken"" but not to an extent where it ruins watching it, because it's one I actually really enjoyed!",5
konosuba-gods-blessing-on-this-wonderful-world,"I've never seen a funnier show than this, absolute comedic masterpiece!Characters are  ALL well put together, with their own funny and unique personalities!Facial animations and voice acting are the things that shine the most in this show!! Seeing all the derpy faces made me laugh in almost every episode, i would highly recommend everyone who didn't watch this yet to   GO WATCH IT IMMEDIATELY!!",5
konosuba-gods-blessing-on-this-wonderful-world,"This is the best comedy anime I've ever seen, and I've seen quite a bit of anime in my day.      The best part of this show by far is the characters. You've just gotta love these clueless idiots. They take all the typical Isekai tropes and flip them on their heads. The MC, Kazuma, instead of being an overpowered cool guy, is an expectant jerk who thinks things will always go his way and is a bit of a perv. He then meets Aqua, who you'd expect to be the majestic love interest, is an entitled, whiny, stupid little idiot who party's and drinks all the time, then begs her party members for money. Megumin is the cute little sister archetype, but along with that is a childish brat. The last of the MC's is Darkness, who appears to be the calm-and-collected, self-sacrificial, older sister type. But why would someone in a world as cruel as Konosuba be so willing to risk her life for others? Well, as it turns out, those 'selfless acts of heroism' are driven by very selfish masochism. In fact, she often risks her life and the lives of her party members just to satisfy her masochism.     Just reading this part of the jerk, the brat, the meme wizard, and the weirdo, you'd think you'd hate all tease characters, right? Well, the show somehow does the complete opposite. You've just gotta love these wonderful idiots. Especially the #BestWorstGirls",5
konosuba-gods-blessing-on-this-wonderful-world,"After dying from laughably and pathetically, Kazuma Satou is offered another chance at life in another world by a goddess known as Aqua, she grants him an omnipotent wish to take one thing with him. He chooses to take Aqua with her, too bad she actually is useless... Now Kazuma and Aqua are stuck in this awful fantasy world and are forced to live out their lives here. Along the way they meet a useless mage named Megumin who can only use explosive magic, (before fainting...) and Darkness, a crusader who is a huge masochist and can't hit the broad side of a barn, despite being incredibly strong. Together the group suffers together and in general make each other and everyone around them miserable.My god is this anime funny, and it has some of the best worst girls to date, Kazuma himself is just a big jerk too, and I love it.",5
konosuba-gods-blessing-on-this-wonderful-world,"For me personally, I think it can be very difficult for a show to make me laugh out loud but this anime did just that, and quite often. The characters are as funny as it gets; while some take on a realistic personality, others are completely over-exaggerated and ridiculous, making for the funniest interactions between them. Everything in this anime is on point to make its audience die of laughter: the facial expressions, voice acting, camera angles, art style, and outrageous amount of weirdness. The situations that the characters are put through are so absurd and unexpected that you can’t help but laugh at everything that’s going on. The show’s parodical moments poking fun at commonly used tropes throughout anime are hysterical and it does a great job of being wildly entertaining. Being more of a lighthearted, comedic anime, Konosuba definitely delivers when you’re looking for something fun to watch and not super serious. Overall, everything about this show just makes it the perfect slapstick adventure.",5
konosuba-gods-blessing-on-this-wonderful-world,"In terms of story, I don't think it has much impact overall. It's not bad but it's obvious that this isn't where all the work went. As for the music, that's not usually something I pay much attention to and admittedly, most of it went in one ear and out the other. HOWEVER!! The second season possesses not only one of the best openings I've ever heard/ seen, it possesses one of the greatest endings I've ever heard/ seen. They're nothing short of marvels.When it comes to the cast, it should be said that these are some of the most instantly likable characters I've ever seen from Aqua's complete uselessness to Darkness' masochism. Kazuma isn't particularly moral for the main hero but that's kind of why I like him so much. He's not the typical RPG fantasy anime protagonist nor is he the cliched harem boy. Honestly, he's kind of a bad person but that helps him fit in with all the other misfits in his group.The best part of this series bar none is the humor. This is straight-up one of the greatest comedy animes I've ever seen, right up there with Excel Saga and Ghost Stories. Even when the story almost vanishes entirely from season two, Konsuba simply takes the opportunity to up the humor levels to 11. I don't think this series told a single joke that I DIDN'T laugh at.Arkada of Glass Reflection named this the best anime of 2016. Hot damn, I think I can see why.",5
konosuba-gods-blessing-on-this-wonderful-world,"This anime is laugh out loud hilarious! In a trope filled genre like this one where things can get rather boring this anime is as subversive and refreshing as it is funny. Where these stories are a power fantasy this is rather an amazing story of crazy, selfish, moronic party who have no business doing adventuring.Each of the main characters is well written and unique in a brilliant way and how they play off each other is brilliant. The comedy is near flawless and even the weakest episodes are still amazing.I can not recommend this anime more.",5
konosuba-gods-blessing-on-this-wonderful-world,"As others have said this is another RPG anime but it doesn't follow the normal style (like SAO) but it is still great. I really enjoyed it a lot. It is definitely different from the more ""serious story"" animes that I usually watch since this one definitely doesn't take anything seriously but that is what I found refreshing.The characters are all hilarious. They all make you like them in their own special way. I am sad (at the time of this writing) there is no Season 3 announced as I would most definitely continue to watch.",5
konosuba-gods-blessing-on-this-wonderful-world,"Konosuba was a pleasant surprise, going into it without any context. The cast pretty make the show in my opinion. A blend of colorful and humorous characters parodying tropes yet having their own personalities provide for a lovable cast of characters. The voice acting also makes the characters and jokes. Speaking of the jokes, none are forced or dry. Even the commonly used ones got me to laugh a lot of times throughout the show. You shouldn't expect anything too serious from this show, (although it certainly did have it's heartwarming and sad scenes) but it's a really solid watch for this season.",5
konosuba-gods-blessing-on-this-wonderful-world,"The anime.That's basically the premise of this. However it is also so much more. It is a fun filled trip containing anime tropes and cliches, some of those which are tastefully averted, stuff that anyone that has played anything even close to D&D will appreciate, and newcomers will hopefully have been left a good impression of what the game can bring to the table.I honestly have no qualms with this anime at all, It was a great ride all the way. The 10 episode seasons also help avoid possible fillers and make it a more compact story overall, meaning you have few repeating jokes or tedious moments.8.5/10",5
konosuba-gods-blessing-on-this-wonderful-world,"You absolutely need to watch this if you've ever played a mmorpg or similar. There are so many gaming references but don't think this is a trapped in a game or virtual reality anime.This is a super fun mix of comedy, sexual, and gaming points. However, beware that if you really begin to enjoy this, that your heart will be crushed when you find out that they aren't making a season 3 anytime soon. Instead, it was one of those animes that were made to make you interested in the manga and buy the manga. I'd love to see future anime adaptations of the whole series. I seriously recommend this anime. The only down side is that there isn't more. There's an ova for the end of S1 you can find that isn't available on CR and there's another one releasing on the 24th of July 2017. I can't wait for this anime/manga series to explode with more content.",4.5
konosuba-gods-blessing-on-this-wonderful-world,"I usually avoid more comedy-oriented series, as the amount of wackiness I get in typical action anime is just enough for me (and often just at my level of tolerance). Still, this one was a pleasant surprise - while it's fun and obviously plays with the conventions of both RPG games and anime, it rarely goes into over-the-top, random absurdity. Rather than that, it uses its cast of dysfunctional, weird characters to build a consistent and entertaining story of overcoming challenges and finding a place for oneself in a new and often antagonistic world.Konosuba is definitely not a perfect show, but I can wholeheartedly recommend it to pretty much anyone. While primarily a parody, it doesn't go overboard in any aspect of it (including fanservice that one could expect to be unbearable, but is actually quite mild). Considering the fun I've had with this series and the consistent quality it offered, I think it deserves a 5-star rating - beside anything else, it one of the best in its genre.",4.5

Its simply just a joy to watch. it does not take itself too seriously and the comedy and enterainment just flows through the episodes to the point i could and did happily watch each season in a sitting.If you are looking for a good anime to watch i highly recommend Konosuba. I cant wait for season 3!",5
konosuba-gods-blessing-on-this-wonderful-world,"Note: This review is based on the first two seasons of KonosubaKonosuba was a show I stumbled on accident. I was watching a video for funniest deaths in anime, and this show happened to pop up. That caught my interest enough that I decided to watch the first season of the show. At the time, I did not write reviews, and by the time I started, they were releasing the second episodes (I feel that a show should not be reviewed while releasing episodes because of possible changes in quality). Now that the second season of Konosuba is finished, I feel that I am prepared enough to make a review. While I am not exactly a comedy specialist, this show was one of the funniest shows I have ever seen. Konosuba does so much right. It has an (annoyingly) catch and cute introduction that introduces the characters very well. The comedy is absolutely amazing. There were moments where I was laughing so hard it hurt. The characters are very well created. Between Darkness' perversion, Megumin's stage flair, Kazuma's  perversion and Aqua's plain stupidity, you are never bored around the characters. Their interactions are priceless and make the show. The animation is fluid and believable. Even the fight scenes are amazing, something you would not expect from a comedy. The plot is surprisingly well written and developed, something that can make the difference between a good and great comedy. While this might be preference, I love the bright colors the show uses. Finally, my personal favorite part is the world, more specifically how messed up and un-video-game-like it is. You will just have to watch the show to understand that part.There are only two minor problems worth mentioning, both doing with the second season. My first problem was the animation. It wasn't necessarily bad, but the switched something around. I am not exactly sure what it is, but I think they changed the dimensions of the characters. Going from the first season to the second, this took some time to shake off and it still felt slightly weird for the entire season. The second was the humor. To put it simply, I felt the second season just was not as funny as the first season. It still had its moments, but it was just overall not as funny (in my opinion, you might disagree after watching it).Overall, Konosuba is a really good show with quirky characters and great humor. I recommend this show to anyone who likes a good laugh. If you are unsure, I recommend you watch the first episode. If you don't laugh, move on and know you tried. If you laughed, give the rest of the show a shot.  Overall Rating: 9/10",5
konosuba-gods-blessing-on-this-wonderful-world,"Look at this point if you watch anime, you've almost certainly seen at least one of the shows the it's a normal guy transported to a fantasy world, he goes on an adventure, and so on. It's a trope that's almost been done to death with great shows, and less than great shows, and total crap. This is a parody of that trope and a fantastic one at that. It pushed the line for what jokes anime is generally willing to tell and pushes in all the right spots. It's got great writing, funny characters, an extremely popular setting and has well earned it's popularity. This is one of the best comedy anime in recent years. If not THE best anime  comedy in the last 2-3 years.But let there be no misunderstandings, this is a comedy and a parody of the genre. Don't jump into this looking for deep characters, fascinating story and moral dilemmas. This is a show you watch to laugh, relax and not care too much. It knows what it is, takes full advantage of that, and does it extremely well. Well generally great, there are some drawbacks to the animation quality at a few points, with one episode flat out feeling like a different studio did it. Also the show overall honestly took me a bit to get sucked in. By the end of season 2 I am begging for more. But at the end of season 1 I was pretty neutral about it.Pros:Excellent humorGreat choice of parodyVery entertaining charactersCons:Some animation issuesBoth seasons are very short.   Final note, I enjoyed the second season much more than the first.",5
konosuba-gods-blessing-on-this-wonderful-world,"The characters are unique, a dude that is almost a perverted low-life, a goddess that isn't quite as powerful as she thinks, a witch that only uses one kind of magic and a masochistic crusader. They take on challenges as you would in an RPG, though not as successful as they would like to be, and even when they are the law of unintended consequences comes back to bite them in the butt. I honestly don't know how to describe this show, but it can be very funny. I'm sad that it is over. probably won't be a 3rd season.",5
konosuba-gods-blessing-on-this-wonderful-world,"This anime is another RPG like story, with your basic characters trying to beat the evil of the land, and have almost perfect like characters whom are incredibly powerful, smart, and takes everything incredibly seriously.. They have nearly no flaws, and are a perfect team..... ......Now take what i just said, and completely flip it, and you get Konosuba!  This anime is one of the funniest shows i have ever seen. One moment you expect something to happen, and they do the exact opposite. You don't know what this group of..er.. special heroes will do, and how far they will go. But trust me.. It's not what you expect out of an RPG like anime.. You will enjoy this adventure, and the crazy people in it. Now go.. Go watch this... I said GO!",5
konosuba-gods-blessing-on-this-wonderful-world,"This anime is fantastic!  Definitely worth watching!  All of the characters have great gimmicks and every episode has a point where you can't help but laugh.  I'd call it an anti-Harem anime almost, i'm not sure what the term is when the guy is surrounded by a bunch of females that he doesn't want to be around.  Season two shows character development while still maintaining the comedic nature of the series.  Season 3 Please!",5
konosuba-gods-blessing-on-this-wonderful-world,"My review's on here are going to be more lax as its a five-point score system but that also means generally better-looking scores! Konosuba is an excellent series with generally good animation and music well keeping it interesting by flipping the dynamics of living in a fantasy world on its head. Haveing interesting and likable characters (if not always morally right or traditionally ""good"" ones) give it an interesting story with many twists and turns. Overall making it a fun, funny, and interesting adventure.",4
konosuba-gods-blessing-on-this-wonderful-world,"this is one of the best shows ive seen in a while.  im trying to get my friends to watch it but their not that into anime anymore. anyway, i love the comedy. at first it seems all depressing then its all happy and like""Ha you died!"" then its like adventure but reality hits them in the face and they have to get a job. my honest to god faverit thing about this show is that the realm there in is kinda like a video game, but most the time their in debt. 10/10 watch please",5
konosuba-gods-blessing-on-this-wonderful-world,"First of all, I never actually write a review for a show so apologies if this is sloppy. KONOSUBA -God's blessing on this wonderful world! is exactly what the title says, it is a blessing on this wonderful world given to us by God! I don't remember ever watching a show that has made me laugh this much before in my life. The characters of this show are extremely weird and that in my opinion is one of the best parts of this show. Each character has their own quirk to them that makes them useless in some way to the main character which in turn brings for a good laugh and interesting character interaction. Megumin = best girl!I'm not one to judge a show based on its animation for the most part, but for some reason  KONOSUBA  has caught my eye in this part. The way the spells that are cast in this show bring some beauty in my eyes. I was especially amazed at when I first saw Megumin's cast of her explosion spell. The story of  KONOSUBA  is one of the typical gets send to another world as the introduction to the show. After that the show takes a different approach on how it interprets a RPG styled world. The characters in this show can be completely useless and it makes you wonder how they get things done.In the end, Megumin is the best thing ever to happen to me and Anime in a long time.",4
konosuba-gods-blessing-on-this-wonderful-world,Nowadays is kind of hard to get any kind of emotion from me due to personal reasons however this show is keeping me laughing every new episode even after several runs on each of the episodes and writers of this show are doing amazing job in throwing these flawed characters in one pot and stirring it up a bit. Voiceacting is absolutely one of the best I have had to hear and soundtracks are a chapter for itself.Amazingly well put together show... doesn't happen oftenLittle gem of the shows,5
konosuba-gods-blessing-on-this-wonderful-world,"This is one of the precious few anime that carries the distinction of being able to make me laugh. In fact, not only does it make me laugh, but each and every episode makes me crack up to the point where I've probably watched the series at least 4 times.This show parodies your typical wish fulfillment harem ""parallel world"" anime, like SAO, and relentlessly demolishes every trope and cliche associated with those genres. The characters are all incredible in that they all have unique personalities which play off each other incredibly well, and the chemistry between the protagonist and his teammates is one of the things which elevates this show from the realm of ""pretty funny"" to ""funniest anime in the past several years.""",4.5
konosuba-gods-blessing-on-this-wonderful-world,"Konosuba is both top notch fantasy and comedy. Studio Deen really nails all the fantasy/RPG tropes that are good for poking fun at, and, they do it exceedingly well. All too commonly, Fantasy series have a strong start and fall apart at the end (SAO, Log Horizon) but Konosuba has escaped this fate thus far, as season one shines from start to finish. I found myself wishing for more episodes instead of rolling my eyes when it finished, and now Season 2 is easily my most eagerly awaited entry of the Winter 2017 season.  I definitely have a soft spot for fantasy anime but this one should be enjoyed by anyone who at least has a little bit of nerd in them (although being an RPG or MMORPG fan likely helps).Good follow up show: Outbreak Company",4.5
konosuba-gods-blessing-on-this-wonderful-world,"This anime was not revolutionary, it wasn't the most well written thing ever, there is nothing insane in this anime, but you know what this anime is. It's  FUN. This my favorite anime to come out in 2016 and it's because of how fun it was. This anime is the second anime I have ever watched that honestly made my gut hurt from laughing, the first being nichijou. The plot, while being what seems to be your everyday ""guy is transported to other world in track suit"" anime, takes the piss out of that exact genre and does it perfectly. The characters are all very unique and I love all of them, I found myself caring more about these characters then I cared about everyone who wasn't Rem in Re:ZERO. They all have personality just flowing from them. This is by no means some kinda view changing anime that will make you see the world differently but if you want to laugh then you have come to the right place.After the last episodes end credits I was treated to large text telling me that a second season was being confirmed and I hope that this doesn't get dropped like everything else and we get to see more of this because it was honestly the most fun I've gotten out of an anime in a long time. I give it 5 explosions out of 5.",5
konosuba-gods-blessing-on-this-wonderful-world,"This anime is a blast to watch and will make you laugh all the way through. Even if it is basically a parody of the other world genre, the story is still great. The best part of the show is the four main characters, each of them are original, funny and lovable (especially Megumin). The music and animation are both wonderful. This anime is certainly in my top 10, because of how good, original, funny and excellent it is. I recommend it to anyone.",5
konosuba-gods-blessing-on-this-wonderful-world,"Where many similar works leave me disappointed by making far too many characters overpowered or simply way too perfect, KonoSuba introduces extremely flawed and at times downright worthless characters who make the terrible mistake of forming a team.I wish every Dungeons & Dragons campaign was just like this. It's beautifully hilarious.This anime will remain a guilty pleasure of mine for a very long time. It contains incredible amounts of adversity to the point that it perfectly satires everything in similar genres that annoyed me.",4
konosuba-gods-blessing-on-this-wonderful-world,"I like shorter series because I actually finish them for once, but this is a show i wouldn't mind if it was longer. Animation is nice and well done.Characters and story are interesting and humorous that keep me coming back to watch episode after episode.Story is very lighthearted, funny, and enjoyable.  If you're looking for something more serious, this definitely isn't it.  If you want something fun, I recommend this show.",4

asteroid-in-love,"I jumped into this anime knowing nothing about it while also expecting nothing. I didn't know what I'd be getting myself into.

Inspired by their shared goal of naming an asteroid, they dive into the life of amateur astronomy. Mira and Ao never meet again, until one day Mira stumbles apon an after school club.This show features a Slice of Life pace revolving two main characters, Mira and Ao. This story is about their love of astronomy and possibly eachother. Focusing on getting their club more funding, they decide to embark upon a mission to pique the interests of their fellow classmates while spreading information about the club's activities. Will they gather more member? We'll find out.If you want to watch a casual anime with some comedic relief give this one a try.",5
asteroid-in-love,"Yes, its looks to be a Cute Girls Doing Cute Things, and in my book that's a fine thing. Nothing out of the ordinary in the character designs, its well done along with art and animation. It's not at Kyoani levels, be amazing if it were, but its more than adequate. The characters are indeed cute, and theres the requisite teacher/adviser. This will fill in my CGDCT needs nicely. They threw in the little possibility of yuri twist there, but I don't think it will be more than a tiny undertone.",5
gintama,"INTRO: What you need to know firstThey say first impressions are important but in the case of Gintama they usually don't do him justice, so before you decide by the premise here's  a bit of advice, go by the 3 episode rule and you'll see what  I mean, Gintama is by no means your average ShounenJump story. Yeah i know 150+ episodes seems like a pretty big commitment, but no need to fret Gintama is an episodic series. Don't like the sound of episodic shounen you say? Well its episodic because it has to be. Gintama's strength is not in the usual beat strongest boss, then beat the strongest strongest boss etc =.=   Its in its hilarious yet at times surprisingly deep episodes. There are story arcs, mind you,  but they usually dont last longer than 3 or 4 episodes at a time the rest of the episodes are short stories contained usually in one episode. It is a perfect balance of the bread and butter of Shounen's a story Camaraderie with some badass action sandwiched in between random and hilarious episodic goodness.So lets get startedFirst offPremise: Get to know our heroesGintama, a carefree, lazy, snot picking hero is an ex samurai working as a ""Yorosuya"" (jack of all trades) with his buddies Shinpachi a wanna-be samurai and overall Otaku  and Kagura a young girl that is actually an alien from a planet of warriors with super-human strength (think Saiyan) during Japan's Edo period. However its been decades since earth has been invaded by aliens and during the transition the world is now 1/4 old world 2/4 Modern 1/4 Futuristic. While not slaves the people of Earth are treated like second class citizens at times bullied and taken advantage of by aliens who are also backed by the government and the police force Shinsengumi  led by Isao Kondo who often clash with the Earth resistance group the Joi Faction led by Gintama's ex comrade Kotaro Katzura. That aside Gin's greatest concern is usually finding ways to pay the rent.Music: ForgettableThe OP and ED so far have been pretty good, not that memorable but pretty good. The OST itself is forgettable, few, and unnoticeable. While some say thats what an anime background music should be I tend to disagree. There is a balance of the music not being distracting but at the same time enhancing the experience. Good background music that comes to mind are The Over World theme of Zelda, Naruto's fighting and depressed themes, and FMA music. (The worst that comes to mind is Bleach's old ""kickin ass theme"", you know the one, with the female chorus saying ""oh ohhhohh"")Characters:There are a lot to meet In the world of Gintama not only are the characters so detailed and vastly varied (from a sadomasochist female ninja that uses nato beans as a jutsu  to a robot maid that thinks its a famicon with Dragon Quest inserted) They are each more complex that you'd think doable especially considering the amount of characters the series keep introducing. Suffice to say each one of them has made me laugh, I can't think of one character that hasn't. To me the characters are the cherry on topAnimationNot mind blowing in its action sequences (compared to the bleach/naruto main story line animation splurges) but nonetheless very satisfying. Where it shines at its best however is in its over-the-top expressions and prefect timing. Taken for granted compared to stylized action sequences but a pillar that supports what makes Gintama so much fun.",5
gintama,"If you're looking for an action packed, power-up riddled, fight driven alternate history sci-fi samurai anime with improbable female anatomy, oversized swords (probably to compensate for the boobage) and crude humor... this isn't it.But! If you're looking for a silly, 4th wall breaking, over the top,  alternate history parody sci-fi samurai anime with surprisingly accurate anatomy (across the board), short and to the point story arcs, a smattering of bad-ass fights, surprisingly touching moments, and more crude humor than you can shake a (curiously phallic) stick at you have arrived at the right place.The plot is fairly straightforward: Instead of Americans forcing open an isolationist Japan, aliens known as Amanto invade the Earth - this sets things in motion for a truly bizarre alternate history where Tokyo is still known as Edo, aliens walk the streets and most modern - as well as futuristic technology - is widely available by the time the story takes place (which is presumably sometime in the late 1800's). But, as the saying goes, the more things change, the more they stay the same. Samurai lost both their status and their swords; forced to abandon their bushido simply to make a living as a working stiff. Not to mention the government is corrupt and the economy sucks.Enter Yorozuya Gin-chan, aka Sakata Gintoki; a ronin and freelancer who's smart enough to let go of his dignity and take whatever job comes his way. He refuses, however, to set down his wooden sword (except for when he's taking a dump, or eating, or reading Weekly Shounen Jump, or sleeping or something).  He, along with Shimura Shinpachi (his apprentice/employee... sort of),  Kagura (employee/roomate/little sister... sort of), and Sadaharu (Kagura's giant dog) have many a wacky adventure as they try to make ends meet, and occasionally save the world.Acting as foils and occasional cohorts for the Yorozuya trio (or fab four, if Sadaharu is with them) are the Shinsengumi. It's tough to be a cop in Edo; the Amanto have diplomatic immunity so they can do whatever the hell they damn well please; washed up samurai line the streets (some are more harmless than others) and it doesn't help that the chief of the Shinsengumi - Kondo Isao - is stalking (with the best intentions and the worst luck) the violent elder sister of Shimura Shinpachi; the Demon Vice Commander Hijikata Toshiro  is obsessed with mayonase and Captain Okita Sogo is just flat sadistic (luckily he's usually more interested in assassinating Hijikata, than unleashing his madness upon the citizens of Edo), and their top spy, Yamazaki Sagaru just wants to play badminton. It's amazing the city's still standing - especially when they lock horns with the Yorozuya - or join forces for the greater good (depends on everyone's mood). Meanwhile, there's various forces trying to bring down the government and generally interrupt Happy Fun Time. Some, like Katsura Kotaro through more comedic means, and others, like Takasugi Shinsuke through brute force. Then of course, there's rogue aliens, stupid princes, rampaging gorillas, incompetent ninja's, MADAO, little old ladies, Naruto jokes, and a plethora of other odd characters to spice things up.It sounds like a train wreck of a series. But it isn't. Gintama combines comedy, sci-fi, action and drama as many other series wish they could. It proves itself a better fit as a ""slice of life"" anime than a straight shounen, but this comes as a welcome relief to anyone tired of the 300+ chapter story arcs with little to no plot advancement (and endless filler in the anime adaptation). Episodic in nature; story arcs (both comedic and serious) are well executed; the usual time wasting devices (a fight episode that's mostly talk; excessive flash backs or recaps and so on and so forth) anime studio's use to pad out episodes are done away with in favor of solid writing and short (and oh so silly) omake.  Animation quality is top notch most of the time - the worst episodes animation-wise are on par with an average episode of several other shounen series. The best are edging not-so-stealthily towards movie quality. The music is excellent as well; Audio Highs consistently delivers with whatever the situation calls for - from big band to acoustic guitar ballads to hard rock and everything in between. Opening and ending sequences - in addition to being lushly animated - are always a joy. Especially when DOES is involved. On top of all that, the voice acting is supurb.All and all, Gintama is a genera bending, 4th wall breaking, lough 'till you cry - and sometimes just cry (manly tears!) - good time.",5
gintama,"Awesomeness is what defines Gintama. A must watch for anyone that is an anime fan. First 3 episodes are a little on the not so funny side but after that it's all out laughing like crazy. Watch the OVA as well as it's an excellent sample of the kinds of things you can expect from this ingeniously written anime. it's not as random as some might have you believe and there is somewhat of a story line behind all the mayhem.The episodes don't follow your standard story arch format, it goes for more of a day to day life of Gin-san and the rest of the cast. Some episodes will have you rolling on the floor laughing and yet others will have you tearing up, while others will have you begging for more action and for Gin-san to show off his true skills. It's a great anime and I highly recommend this to anyone, especially if you've watched many animes although it is not a requirement as Rumbel Subs does an excellent job of telling you exactly what they parodying and/or referencing. Anyone who watches this and manages to keep a straight face has no soul. The characters are memorable, and this is the first time that I've seen an series pull off being able to not rely solely on a plot and do it so well! This is a classic for the ages! The mysterious past of Gintoki, Zura and Takasugi compels you to keep watching this anime. The recurring charcaters are awesome too. Hijikata, Okita, Kondo, Elizabeth-san, Otae, Yamazaki, Otose, Catherine do a wonderful job for most part. The lack of main plot is backed up by these solid characters.Soundtrack of this series is something that comes once in a decade. The music used in the series intensifies the depth of the scene, whether it be a comical situation or a matter of life and death. Animation is also of a great quality. Costumes are awesome and the edo is designed in a weirdly attractive style. In my opinion, Bl**ch and Na**to are far too overrated. This is what an anime should be like. Once you start watching it, the lack of main plot will not - yes I said, IT WILL NOT - bother you at all.",5
gintama,"Hideaki Sorachi is either a genius or smoking marijuana when he created Gintama. Whatever inspired him has given birth to a never-tiring concept in the shonen genre. An anime that has no limits—It can parody anything. Gundam, transformers, samurai, aliens, ghost, celebrities, idols, and monsters. Dragon Ball, One Piece, Bleach, and Naruto are among the anime that was parodied in Gintama. It can make you laugh so hard, you'll hurt your stomach. It can make you cry. It can keep you in the edge of your seat. Other mangakas are probably jealous of Sorachi because his Gintama can't get old nor possibly ran out of material because it's so flexible. You can have a parody version of Batman crashing into their home one day and it would make sense in the world of Gintama. I mean, they already had Will Smith before in one of their episodes. Gintama is character driven. You'll watch it for its memorable characters more than its story (If there's even any). Shockingly, nearly all of Gintama's character are not just memorable but can be a star of their own show. In fact, this is the biggest strength of Gintama—the characters!",5
gintama,"In short, Gintama has ruined all other anime for me for the rest of my life. This is storytelling at its finest. I could gush over the depth (the utterly unfathomable, beautiful depth) of the characters who are so human you forget they aren't real--samurai, aliens, robots, and villains alike. I could praise the brilliance (and hilariously clever dirtiness) of the humor juxtaposed with the sudden beauty of the most touching/tragic stories that you will ever have the fortune of seeing and making you sob until you feel like even your soul is crying. Or I could rant about how much I've been trolled/learned about trolling and thoroughly enjoyed being trolled. But basically, I could just say that I worship at the altar of Sorachi sensei, and I have never been more inspired or jealous of an author who portrays himself as a nose-picking gorilla. Gintama is one of the best things I've ever watched in my life, and if it's not for you, I don't know what to say. Except maybe that it'd give me an urge to rip off your mole.",5
gintama,"Oh, boy. Where do I even begin to review the colossal anime (in length and in depth) that is Gintama?Someone once compared Gintama to a hot pot of anime, and it is probably the best descriptor for it if Gintama can ever be summarized in a mere few words. It literally has everything under the sun (and beyond it, with aliens and all) and seriously everything you could ever want in an anime bundled up in one unassuming package. It's clearly not flashy; there isn't anything particularly gorgeous about the art style, there is no elaborate plot, no in-your-face drama. But what Gintama does have is heart.It's not even cheesy. Gintama brings out the most genuine emotions, and before you even realize it, the whole character cast has completely grown on you. Where Gintama shines the most is undeniably in its cast, from the main-character-who-really-doesn't-act-like-one-but-is-nevertheless-the-coolest Sakata Gintoki, to the alien-girl-from-China-who-is-absolutely-awesome-in-berserk-mode Kagura, to the glasses stand Shimura Shinpachi, to his insane sister who abuses eggs, Otae, to her unshakeable stalker (and somehow Chief of the Shinsengumi) Kondo Isao and his second in command, Demon Vice-Chief Hijikata Toushirou with the mayonnaise addiction and tsundere-ness, and super Sadist (with a capital S) Okita Sougo whose number one priority is killing Hijikata-san and usurping his position. A glasses-wearing ninja assassin, a ninja with hemorrhoids, a girl who really wants balls, and a really pitiable sunglasses-stand round out the main recurring cast. Then, there is the (now moderate) terrorist Zura who is somehow still the oddest out of a cast already so odd and whose antics cannot even be summed up here because he is really just too odd. Seriously. Watch out for this guy and the OST that plays every time he appears.Somehow I was carried off track trying to describe characters... but the characters are really pure gold. Well, silver. You don't even realize it until you reach one of the serious arcs, and then... that's it, you're absolutely hooked, because each and every one of the characters are so incredibly real. All those early episodes that never seemed to do much? While it's true that Gintama does have a slow start, never skip any of the early episodes (besides 1-2 if you really have to). It is during those episodic, seemingly-unimportant gag moments that you get a feel of the cast in daily situations, much like getting to know a person in real life. And then when it actually matters, those people who have slowly wormed their way into your heart become really effective characters. The way characterization and character development is done so subtlely is unparalleled in animanga already, and then...You have the hilarity. We're talking about laughter that hurts, laughter that drops you to the floor and squeezes tears out of your eyes and suffocates you and makes you cackle. Cackle. Admittedly, a lot of Gintama is hit-and-miss depending on if you know what they're referencing or punning or parodying about, especially in the beginning. But as the series goes on, Gintama begins to rely on character jokes too, based on the characters we've all grown to love over the course of the series, and all of it is done so impeccably well and so cleverly. Yes, there are definitely times when Gintama misses. But, when Gintama actually does hit (and that hitting becomes more and more frequent), it is absolutely out of this world funny. I am almost convinced there will never be anything funnier, because anything funnier would be lethal. And that's not even all of it. Sorachi-sensei is a genius already, but then the seiyuu cast freaking make it even better. This is why you should choose the anime over the manga, folks. But I'm sure you already know that since you're on Crunchyroll. I've actually always been more of a manga person, but I listened to someone who advised the anime and it seriously makes a huge difference. Not that the manga is bad in any way, and arguably there are some parts with better pacing in the manga, but the freaking voice actor cast. I've never paid much attention to seiyuu before when I watched anime, but every voice actor absolutely shines here. Tomokazu Sugita.. Akira Ishida... Kazuya Nakai.. Kenichi Suzumura... I am thorougly convinced you can never find a better Gintoki, Zura, Hijikata, or Sougo in anyone else. And, of couse, our poor Shinpachi, Sakaguchi Daisuke, who I am surprised still hasn't lost his voice yet with all the yelling he has to do.Also, the awesome OPs and EDs and OSTs. They set the mood very, very well.I mentioned the serious arcs earlier, and I really wanted to bring it up again. Let it not be forgotten that Gintama is a shonen. It tends to focus on the comedy a lot more, but it is still a shonen through and through, and when it actually shows its shonen side... it is intense and you can really see where their budget went. Fighting is always straight to the point, and there can actually be a lot of gore. And then... DUN DUN DUN... you realize that Gintama is actually capable of plot. Yes, there is actually a plot. Don't listen to people who say Gintama is only a gag series--those people have clearly not watched the whole thing. Gintama's plot takes like sixty episodes to actually show up and another two hundred to actually develop, but it is there underlying all of the comedy. 265 episodes later... you realize a huge plot was actually brewing behind the scenes after all. Of course, it's still going to be mostly comedy and episodic fun, but Gintama has its serious side, too, and it does not feel out of place at all. The anime has gone on hiatus, unfortunately... but I really believe it will be back some day. And when it does, I will come right back and watch it with all of the characters I've grown familiar with... and I know it'll still be a resounding five stars. The manga reached its tenth anniversary just recently; here's to another decade of Testicles!",5
gintama,"I honestly started watching Gintama because I heard that it has good comedy and I wasn't expecting anything extraordinary from it, but after a while I fell in love with this series. No anime could make me feel all these emotions but Gintama. At first glance, Gintama doesn't look special. but let me tell you something; Gintama is a treasure, a piece of art, no I am not even exaggerating at all. Everything was beyond my expectations. I have a huge standard, so that means a lot. I can't explain Gintama, and no one will ever can. There's some moments in Gintama I would be about to cry and then, I would laugh at what was happening. Gintama is seriously turning me into a bipolar. You can't predict what will happen in this anime, seriously. I recommend Gintama to someone who has at least some kind of experience with anime because Gintama has a lot of reference to other anime, and it makes it funnier if you understand what's going on. I have to add that the humor in Gintama is really original, I mean, everything in Gintama is. Gintama has serious arcs and less serious ones, but you can't hate those random funny episodes because they are actually important as well; they are part of the plot (yes, Gintama has a plot)All this to say that: GINTAMA WILL FOREVER BE MY FAVOURITE ANIME, that's huge because like I said, I have a high standard. I want more people to know about Gintama and laugh with me because laughter is the best medicine! Also, you absolutely have to watch the last movie of Gintama after you finished Gintama': Enchousen (season 2) because it's AWESOME! Best movie I've seen so far!",5
gintama,"This is the show that beats them all.Animation 10/10: Gintama had excellent quality to begin with, after like episode 170 they go widescreen and became amazing.Story 10/10: Most original story in anime ever created. The comedy, action and drama are meshed together in perfect harmony. You'll be crying from the drama one moment, and the next cracking up at sex jokes.Characters 10/10: Good whole characters, best main character in any anime, no lie. Virtually no fillers after the first 2 episodes.Overall: My favorite show.",5
gintama,"At first I was like, it is too long, should I invest my time in this? Soon I had my answer. YES, Gintama is a masterpiece. I think it is the funniest anime I have ever seen. The anime itself is a joke, making parodies about the most popular animes, manga and other popular references.Yes, it is extremely funny, yet, when it has to be serious, it is one the coolest, most dramatic, sentimental and darkest series!. The characters are just awesome. There are at least 20 main characters! Each one of them is memorable, no one is secondary, they all work in harmony to create and excellent work. It is not like other anime that they introduce a character and that's it. Everyone is important. Now, Gintoki is definitely one of the Weekly Shonen Jump stars and here you will know why! He is hilarious, cool, strong, good hearted,a glutton, loves to drink.He is such a complex character, so cool and he does not even try. Which remembers me, After watching this anime you will not know why this is such a good anime, but still love it! Nobody know what Gintama is about, but still they love it! Even though it is kind of a gag anime, it has some stories that are very interesting, being the most important for me the Shogun Assassination Arc.Also the openings and ending are memorable. Everything is amazing! It doesn't matter if there are 300 episodes, at the end you will feel like you need more, believe! This anime is surely a 100% recommended!",5
gintama,"As with most people who first gave Gintama a shot, I watched the first three episodes, didn't think much of it, and ended up dropping the series for a few months....big mistakeI eventually revisited the series and since then, Gintama has become my one of my absolute favorite series ever (and I've seen countless different anime). After a few dozen episodes, the comedy starts to pick up and once you hit those serious story arcs, Gintama just becomes amazing - with some of the best story telling and fighting scenes out there!If you're still debating on whether you should watch Gintama still - Just Do It!",5
gintama,"You may have read a thousand and one other good reviews, but I think that all new viewers still have a bit of doubt in their mind. Sure, Gintama doesn't appeal to everyone, but for some damn reason, it brings together so many different types of people. I was very cynical of this show at first, in fact, it took me a month or two to convince myself to watch episode three. It was a gradual love, but once I realized how good this anime was, I never went back.So you can keep reading other reviews and try to nitpick and doubt every biased thing coming out of fans' mouths, but ultimately, you will have to give this anime a try and whether you like it or not is up to you. I'm just saying this anime is the best for me.",5
gintama,"Simply this anime surrounds 3 main characters with many many other sub characters. The main character Gintoki is the hero of this anime, being a uniquely lazy hero who has this humorous charm about him which makes us all laugh and love him. This anime most DEFINATELY has the best arcs I have ever seen in any long running anime. Most arcs (eg. 9/10 arcs) or sub stories are all extremely well played out and written leaving me laughing or even tearing and crying in some episodes. This anime makes you love every character, as it is a long running anime, it creates depth with each character, making you love each and every single one of them.the only let down is that this is still a japanese cultured anime, having a lot of its humor and jokes made for only japanese people to understand which leaves foreigners wishing they were japanese. TTA MUST WATCH ANIME, SIMPLY EXCELLENT!!I recommend to everyone, this anime tops the list for sure.If you thought this was a helpful review, please check out my profile and other reviews :] thanks",5
gintama,"At first when my bro told me to watch ""Gintama"" I was all like, ""the heck is Gintama, what does the name even mean."" It took me awhile to convince myself to give this series a try and I have absolutely never regretted watching Gintama except for the fact that it distracts me from my homework way too well. XDSpoiler Alert! Click to show or hide Also gotta love Shinpachi's scream in Episode 20 and Gintoki's scream in Episode 153 and 204!! XD Gintoki's seiyuu is seriously the best of the best.",5
gintama,"No, seriously.Gintama has basically EVERYTHING an anime needs.You wanna laugh uncontrollably? You wanna cry your eyes out? (Because some of these arcs are actually intense, it really caught me by surprise!) It may seem like any random anime towards the beginning, but I promise you, that all changes in later episodes. c;For those of you who are doubtful in watching this anime, please give it a try. You won't regret it.You never know, you may become hooked on it like I am now~! ^^",5
gintama,"This is not a real review but a warning: The first few episodes are terrible and make you wonder how anyone could ever enjoy this show Gintama. I loathed this show for the first few episodes but continued watching after reading someones review and their suggestion to watch at least 3 episodes. I think at the 4th or 5th episode I really started to enjoy it and its gotten better every episode since then. Please give it a shot and erase the first few terrible episodes from your memory and enjoy the rest lol. It really is a great show, just terrible start ^_^Please watch. It is great! +_+*",5
gintama,"I've seen animes come and go, since I saw my first anime in the early 1990's.. (not counting atroboy) >.>After awhile I got bored of the usual animes, (anime with too much stereotypical characters, and lame story-telling). But after finding Gintama, this changed themes in anime on a whiole different level. O.OI was first weary to watch Gintama... but since watching the first episode, I'm hooked. At first it gives off this crazy view of another universal look, taking place in a time of a past era... leaves you thinking (what if?)...aliens came to earth, we end up getting technology at a earlier time..and even though trying to live a simple life..there is chaos.Sounds like a pretty good story, even it's humor is way off the charts. But leaves a form of satifaction after reading the manga, and even watching the end of the episode of this series.This isn't a normal type of story-telling, but I don't seem to get bored watching Gintama. The music suites the scenes perfectly.. Loved hearing Tommy's op song theme for the starting of the series.. This anime gets even better.. the characters blends into this type of universe.. (not like some other animes that has so many characters, can't follow the story-line)... However with Gintama, your able to follow each character. ~Cause the characters in Gintama doesn't seem out of place~ ^o^As for the animation.. I admire the work put into this series, and plus it isn't bad on the eyes, cause it does have great detail.Humor?... For the humor part of it, I'm not a fan of bathroom  humor.. like some bathroom scenes in some animes.. but for some reason Gintama can make the joke work in this type of reality.I rated Gintama a high rate, cause it's not everyday to watch an anime, that you feel you want to see more of.. This series has a certain charm, and it's humor of has (many) types of non-reality that doesn't seem to slack. But when theres a serious moment in the series, it doesn't crush Gintama's worldly atmosphere.. actually it enhances it.Gintama is a rare series, that we won't see much of in years to come. To me it's a rare find, even when re-watching the episodes, it still makes me laugh..Glad to watch this anime, it's worth looking into.",5
gintama,"There are really no words to describe the greatness of this show. There are several of them that I can throw at you such as: pure comedy, real action, best feels, badass copyrights issue and insane hype  This is worth re-watching over and over and over again, please do recommend this to your friends and family. Their time won't be wasted in vain, I guarantee you that this is one of the most beautiful part of anime and manga industry. <3",5
gintama,"I never write reviews for shows. But after binge watching 353 episodes in a span of 3 weeks, I have to say Gintama takes the gold and the silver, balls and all.Gintama has both wonderful gag arcs and dramatic arcs, with compelling characters to boot. The comedy in Gintama is HILARIOUS, with all kinds of clever, random, witty, and, of course, dirty jokes. The fourth wall is practically thin air in this anime, and the troll faces in Gintama are truly divine. Tomokazu Sugita is a god of voice acting, and the other seiyuus excel at line delivery as well.A lot of people may get intimidated by such a long anime, but there is no fluff in this show, not even in the gag episodes. The drama and comedy are well spaced so that you have plenty of laughs and plenty of action at all times. The action scenes are fantastic, full of spirit and intensity without dragging it out unneccessarily. The morals in Gintama are also well delivered. Gintama veers away from suicide missions, maintaining both courage and responsibilty. It also rejects the 'lone hero' trope, instead believing in sharing the burden with comrades. I was pleasantly surprised by its touch on gender roles since Shonen Jump characters tend to neglect women. But Gintama displays women who fight equally to men, get injured equally to men, and carry conviction equally to men. Though not perfect, Gintama is on the right track to strong women in mind, character, and body. One female character proudly announces she is neither man nor woman and is simply herself, the individual. Gintama committs wonderfully to friendship, faith, integrity, and resilience.If you managed to read this entire review, congratulations, you win Gintoki's balls, which he loses quite often actually. Gintama is truly a crown jewel of anime and no words are fit to describe the imperfect masterpiece Hideaki Sorachi has created. If you decide to watch this rollercoaster of an anime, hold on tight.P.S. If you finish the show, come talk to me about the character shippings.",5
gintama,"Having a bad day? Gintama. Having a good day that you can't cry? Gintama. Moral lessons? Gintama. Unique characters? Gintama. A Great Sense of Humor? Gintama. A Spice of Reality life Situations? Gintama. You cannot go wrong with watching Gintama, the voice actors and actress really matched with the characters. For newbies, who are curious if they should watch Gintama or not? You should and why not?. A little note in here, the first 20 episodes, you might find it boring and unusual but I guaranteed you as the episode goes higher the more it becomes Good and brilliant. I am the type of person who easily gets's bored but then someone told to keep watching so I just kept on watching hoping that it would get better and Oh my God, it did, you'll miss it for not being able to watch! Each character has its own sense of uniqueness, diversity and it's own characters. This anime will give you a lot of "" Anime joke references"" haha. My favorite person in this anime is Katsura, Okita Sugo, Shinpachi, and Gintoki, although I love all the characters in this anime. The anime wouldn't be this good if one of the characters in Gintama is gone, but those 4 people are just my favorite. Give it a try!I hope you find this review helpful. Have a great day!",5
gintama,"Literally I have watched over 100 different anime series and out of all of them this is my most favorite. In the beginning the art is very bad, but come on this was made a while ago so everything sucked back then. BUT IF YOU KEEP WATCHING DEAR LORD THERE WILL BE NO REGRETS.You will find yourself laughing, crying, choking on whatever snacks your eating, and absolutely falling in love with every character. The comedy, storyline, action, adventure, plot twists, character development, and unique genius is what makes this anime so great.I highly recommend this anime. There will be no regrets. GINTAMA FOR LIFE <3",5
gintama,"The only problem is that the show is still not ongoing Give it a shot.  Like any show, it needs a few episodes to really find itself, but it is by far the best show out there.  You will be dying with laughter at the complete randomness, dying with sadness at the heart wrenching and deep stories, and gasping for breath at the intense awesomeness that it Gintama!!  One viewer gave it a poor rating, stating that after 7 episodes he dropped it.. it only gets better and better and better with time, trust me and the 10,000 other people that gave it 5/5 stars.  It is great, stick with it, you will not be disappointed, we promise!",5
gintama,"It isn't even fair to compare Gintama with any other anime, because - let's face it - Gintama stands on its own. It took me a couple of episodes to get the gist of things, but when I did... all hell broke loose :')Gintama made me cry from its hilarity, and from its unexpected warm & fuzzy moments. I honestly have no idea how to explain this series to ya'll.Doesn't matter though, because guys,  this  is a bloody great anime. Hands down one of the best!!",5
gintama,"This show has brought me what i truly want, it is a phenomenon and above all does not Drag you around the bend like most anime do nowadays, only this show can waste time by making an episode about wasting time, or makes you sit through 30min of who eats the next bite of meat in the Soba, and makes it worth your time, each episode is an adventure, each story arc magnificent, this show is one that MUST go on",5
gintama,"I adore Gintama. Why? It's funny. It makes me giggle. It's weird. It's weird in a good way. Sure there is a lot of toilet humor, jokes based on the male anatomy, terrible puns and bad impersonations and downright nonsensical jokes but that just gives it it's charm. You know, the same charm the a crude, tasteless teenage boy might have. Ok, maybe charm isn't a good word, but it has something and that something is a good something. Think SNL skit, except animated and in Japan. With aliens.",5
gintama,"My sister kept telling me to watch this anime. I watched the first 2 episode and got so bored i stopped watching it. A month later after having no other anime to watch i just kept watching it. After the first 15 episodes i realized that i was hooked. I couldn't stop watching it, it's as if my eyes wouldn't let me stop. I couldn't even sleep lol, my hands just wouldn't let me turn off my laptop, it automatically made to go to the next episode. If you really want to know why Gintama is the full package, start reading from here.  Gintama is freaking hilarious. Some episodes you literally choke from laughing. The other night i was rewatching episode 152 and cried because it was so funny. Gintama is very meaningful. Some episodes make you choke from crying. Even though most of gintamas episodes are meaningful, there are those episodes that make you cry from having such a heart ache. Trust me on this, i know from experience, i woke up with swollen eyes because of this anime. Gintama has amazing action. I sometimes wonder how the anime people do it. Their art is pretty tight, i would never be able draw the epic battles this anime has. Gintama leaves you with suspense. This anime leaves you with an impression after each episode. WARNING You wont really understand if you start from a random episode, start from episode one and push through the first 6 or 10 episodes and you will be hooked!!! but don't just take my word for it... watch it, NOWWWWyou wont regret it!!!",5
gintama,"This show man....I had a terrible time getting past episode 1 of this show when first finding it. Take my advice...just watch the show, dont go by the first episode which if it had been episode 30 would have been great. The first episode is a cold shock to the system. You really need to dip your toes into the insanity that is Gintama before becoming fully immersed in this Rollercoaster of a world. I dont like reviews that tell me what the show is actually about. So, light spoilers here. I will just tell you what the show has done to me:1: It made someone look at me extremely funny when I burst out laughing for apparently no reason when watching with earpods. 2: Its had me tearing up. And I am a dude. Im an adult dude. 3: Did I mention milk out your nose funny? 4: Its caught me by the short and scruffies and made me watch until the damn sun came up because I lost track of time. 5: Its gone from being a light funny show to being one of the most badass Hard Boiled shows you will see......then flips the script and does a whole show based on toilet humor, but done in such a way that its not ""hur hur he farted"". More Seinfeldian ""Can you spare a square"" stuff. Again keeping me up until the sun came up through multiple arcs....Then does straight toilet humor. The whole show is insane, its obnoxious, its adolescent, its gross, the storyline is completely inconceivable. It breaks most taboos, and it shouldnt work. Trust me you will love it.",5
gintama,"This being my first review please excuse its roughness.Story: 10/10 Never have I seen another anime in which every episode was fantastic. The arcs were all great and the filler was always good and some of it was better than the arcs. Truly a masterpiece.Art: 9/10 This show has some fantastic art however the it's not perfect, just very close.Sound: 8.5/10 Has some very good music but some of the op's and ed's could be better as well as music being reused a noticeable amount.Overall: 9.5/10 Fantastic in so many way with an amazing cast of 3 dimensional characters to a story so absurd in so many ways they is still able to retain the tension and emotional impact in all the scenes it's needed in. It may not be a 10/10 but i comes very  VERY  close. TL:DR: Watch the show, you won't regret it.",5
gintama,"Gintama is not only comedic with memorable characters, its always dramatic and its not afraid to tear at your heart with not only the story and twists, but even the soundtrack will make you cry. Its by far my favorite anime, makes me laugh, cry, scream... just everything. I will never stop recommending this anime. Nothing has ever compared to how much I love this anime. The absolute love you will feel towards these characters.. its unbelievable. Almost 500 episodes isn't enough, but at the same time if it ends it will feel complete. The moment this anime end tho I will be cry and rewatch it. Nothing like it.",5
gintama,"I first were a bit sceptical about Gintama, but after watching all episodes(to the date i wrote this) I gotta say, its one of the best series i have ever seen. Many other reviewers have written very detailed explanations about the start of the show and i wont copy them(read them yourself ) All i can say is that Gintama has a lot of silly humor, but occasional serious arcs as well and the balance is pretty good imo. Ofcourse there are some jokes that can go over your head if you dont research things, or read the episodes comments(that i had to do several times xD ) Watch atleast 5 episodes to really get into this Even JoJos Bizarre adventure needed more episodes to get interesting(for me atleast, had to watch half of the first season of jojo to get into it, it is also really good) 5/5 would watch the whole thing again because the fisheyed Gintama and silly Kagura!",5
gintama,"As someone who is very new to anime I have been very choosy on which shows to watch. I had heard rumblings of this show long before having a Crunchyroll account. After watching the first couple episodes of the show I slowly grew to like the quirky characters and fun scenarios. That was just the first 15 episodes. I bought a Crunchyroll account because of this show, and not a single regret is in my mind. This show can leave you crippled from laughter, saddened by a dark twist, on the edge of your seat by emotion filled battles, and leave you craving more as the building story becomes more epic and more gripping. The characters are beyond lovable, the shticks are well crafted, and each episode has love and passion poured into it to the point even filler feels like it is on purpose. I cannot sing this show's praises any more and am happy to know it was brought back from the verge of cancellation on a few occasions. It deserves every bit of a attention its been given and more.",5
gintama,"Gintama. It's a series that everyone calls ""the best comedy ever."" I had to check out the series everyone boasted highly about. The first couple of episodes caught my attention but reading it had no plot discouraged me from continuing. It wasn't until I reached episode 25 that I knew it really was something else. This show has unique characters that always keeps the comedy fresh and hilarious. For example, today I found myself trying to resist laughing out loud in a computer lab. This show just always finds ways to make you laugh with its references/characters/situations and being on episode 173 I can tell you it's ""the best comedy ever."" The plot of Gintama is basically following the lives of Sakata Gintoki, Kagura and Shinpachi while meeting new characters and allowing them to develop through their adventures. Although comedy is its strong suit, it does have action that is just as entertaining. I highly recommend this show! Edit: I finished it and can truly say it's my #1 show. The action that takes place later in the story reminds me to stop calling it ""just a comedy"" because it's so much more. Once you reach episode 300, there is a clear plot as the manga is on its final arc. If there's a time to start Gintama, it would be now before the final season begins!",5
gintama,"Honestly a review can't do this long standing adaption justice, so let me say this, you see that review to the right? Look closely at how many people reviewed 1 or 2 stars, on a crappy but popular anime you can see how a lot of people rate it harshly in order to try and compensate for the artificially high score, but with gintama that doesn't happen. Or how about this: https://myanimelist.net/topanime.php If this doesn't show you why you should consider watching gintama, nothing will. If you have a good sense of humor or enjoy comedy even a little bit, this anime will blow you away. The first few episodes aren't that great, but give it time and I garuntee you'll wonder where gintama was all your life.",5
gintama,"Gintama is one of if not the funniest comedy series ever made. Even though it is in Japanese I don't think even an average joe who has never see anime before would be able to resist cracking a smirk. With it's many quirks, over the top reactions and truly well thought out jokes silly or long running, a joke never falls flat or becomes bland in anyway and that is something that is truly remarkable. If you love Comedy you've reached Valhalla.",5
gintama,"Fantastic comedy? CHECK. Tear-jerking drama? CHECK. Unbelievably epic, well choreographed fight scenes? CHECK. Well developed characters? CHECK CHECK CHECK. Gintama is an oddity in the sense that it is able to mash together so many differing types of storytelling and absolutely nail it all. If you haven't even seen this series, start now!That all being said, it is a very long series and can take a little bit of work to get into at the beginning. But stick with it, it is so worth it. Much of Gintama relies on its fantastic characters and the interaction between them all. When watching at the beginning for the first 20 episodes or so, you're still being introduced to/warming up to all of the characters. But the longer you stick with it the better and better it gets.Gintama has become my favorite anime series by far. Zura janai, Katsura da!",5
gintama,"Gintama's greatest accomplishment is that despite being a shonen comedy/action series with an overwrought premise and hundreds of episodes, it stands apart of the best work of its kind in a long time.Its sense of humor is brilliantly juvenile and smartly self-referential. The main character is a (sometimes shockingly effective) good-for-nothing manchild, but you'll love him more for it. There are numerous interludes where characters break the fourth wall and apologize for their sins against the viewer, for instance, and then later apologize again for having wasted your time with a meta joke. The show knows all the stupid tricks that other shonen shows use to pad their time, and slyly pokes fun without ever coming off as mean.Gintama would be great parody if that's all there was to it, but in fact it stands apart as a serious story as well. It's hard to tell at first, but buried beneath the poop jokes and absurdities is a touching series of interwoven narratives about Japan keeping its soul in the face of overwhelming change.You'll laugh. You'll cry. You'll wish you had a time machine.  Even if shonen bores you, stop what you're doing and watch Gintama.But if you want, you can go get a drink during the first episode and try to catch up later.  It's what Gintoki would do.",5
gintama,"This show is hilarious that is the common belief about Gintama,but it also contains action scenes and heart-warming or heart-breaking moments,it is a mix of everything and I mean everything:sci-fi,samurai,contemporaneity,parody,original story.Gintama is an anime of contrast that will surprise you with not only every episode,but every scene.It is unpredictable and discontinuous,but it is part of its magic.Sometimes it may be hard for someone non-japanesse to get all the jokes,but it is not that bad,if you are a fan of anime this is a show that you have to watch no matter if it is just 5 episode or all,when you feel bored on Saturday evening open an episode,I am pretty sure you will not regret it.",5
gintama,"I was skeptical at first, but I am so glad I got hooked on this anime! I love how even though there are so many episodes, there is still something that can make me laugh. I have favorite characters, but I think all characters make up GIntama and that without one, GIntama would not be complete. I recommend 100%!!! The only thing I would have to tell new watchers is that there may be some episodes where you may not find funny and you may see that they are trying hard, but I still am in love this is anime, so I still say go and watch!!!",5
gintama,"Amazing art,characters that you come to love even if you hate at first,Amazing heartfelt arcs and stories, but above all, HILARIOUSLY FUNNY!! I lost track of all the parody references and I have never been happier,never get tired of it.I,like many was confused by it at first, the plot is somewhat confusing, if there can be considered a plot lol. But all in all, knowing about writing and animation myself,I have to give my props to the mangaka and the staff in the series, it takes a lot to draw your emotions and keep yours interest so fluently. i'm honestly amazed.So watch it,no matter what you do!!Ill give you 300 yen xP!",5
gintama,"At first I didn't like this show, I didn't watch this for like 2 months. Then I gave this another chance and little by little I started to appreciate this anime. It isn't your typical shounen anime like naruto or bleach, but it's one of the best in my opinion. Yeah, this show is episodic but it has some arcs which were usually 2-5 episodes. Battles didn't last 30 episodes like it would in bleach.  Strongest point in my opinion on this show is its humor and characters. The show itself is very unique, I haven't seen anime like this. Variation is also one of the main grips of this show. There's parodies, some bad-ass battle scenes, horror stories, romance and much, much more. I think gintama itself is genre. Animation is pretty good, particularly starting from episode 201. It irritated me a bit that they used 4:3 ratio until episode 199. I got used to it after a while. There isn't an actual story, but Gintoki's past itself and events from joi war era are often mentioned so I think that's the main story. But I like the way Gintama does its story.",5
gintama,"A lot of people would confuse me in the past when I would ask if I should watch this anime or not. I felt like I could never get a grasp on if i would like GinTama or not. The way people talked about it made it seem like it was one big comedy with some all right drama every now and then. So let me describe this anime for you perfectly so you won't be confused:1) first, GinTama feels more like an 'experience' than just watching some anime. I've never felt that before from any other anime.2) yes, the series is chock full of humor and hilarious situations/characters etc. Seriously, no series (and i've seen a good bit just name one) does humor better and makes you authentically laugh more than GinTama.3) the isn't some 'random' series with random things happening all the time like people describe it to be. When people say 'random' i picture boring episodes that i just have to grind through to get to the good bits. GinTama is simply an 'every day' series of the Odd Jobs group and their friends in Edo. It is very entertaining and never feels forced or random. Everything flows brilliantly.4) GinTama balances humor and drama better than any entertainment show i have ever seen. It's what truly makes GinTama an experience. Think the epicness of One Piece story wise and add in the best humor done on any entertainment platform and you have GinTama.Basically, experience GinTama you will love it.",5
gintama,"Gintama is my favorite anime, to put it bluntly. It has absolutely everything. Comedy: Poop jokes, puns, slapstick, nudity, parodies, and recurring gags. Violence: Fighting for friends/allies, fighting epic battles against armies, bleeding from various wounds, sadistic enemies who love to cause pain, more slapstick, typical shounen-style fights that last for 5 episodes. Romance: Comedic unrequited love, requited love that was not meant to be, lovers torn apart by various circumstances coming together to die in each others' arms, homosexual love, heterosexual love, idol worship, pet love. Drama: Arcs that will break your heart one second and have you laughing with tears streaming down your face the next, built-up drama that ends in unsatisfying gags, drama that is hinted at in the beginning and not mentioned again for 100 episodes, moments that make you truly begin to relate to and bond with a character previously only used for gross comedy. The usual problem with Gintama, though, is that it may take a few tries to truly see the worth. Nearly every fan has that story of people who tried and disliked it and refused to try again. I was convinced I hated the show until I was forced to watch the popularity arc, the third attempt. That got me mildly interested and by the next week, I was binge-watching every episode with my brand-new Crunchyroll account, purchased just for Gintama. Give it a try. Then another try. And a third one for good measure. And you'll be hooked.",4
gintama,"Gintama is one of the few anime that can actually make me laugh out loud in real life.+Gintama has very funny characters and they never cease to amaze me. They characters are very lovable and cute. +Humorous, you better not eat while watching Gintama because you might spit out your food because of how funny it is. +Good story; something new always happen+It will make you feel better after you had a rough day.5/5 ""ITS A MASTA PIECE""-Dunkey",5
gintama,"Gintama is and will always be my go-to anime. I join new fandoms, love other things, but in the end I will always return to Gintama as the one series I love above anything else. Every single character speak to me, I love them all and everything they do. The jokes are hilarious, I might be immature for laughing at toilet humour and dick jokes but dammit if it isn't the best kind of comedy I can think of. And when you don't laugh your ass off at the stupidity and silly antics of the characters you will bawl your eyes out from the serious arcs and the heartwarming side-stories. The new season and the improved budget makes me so happy because it looks like Gintama is finally getting the quality anime that it deserves. There's a special charm to the earlier seasons, but there's nothing like looking at the characters you love in beautiful high definition animation! One thing I do wish for is some more recognition of the series in the West. It's booming in Japan, but very underground anywhere else. So if you love this series or want to recommend an anime to someone, please tell them to check out Gintama. They won't regret it. Please watch Gintama!!",5
gintama,"I'm not gonna lie when i first started watching Gintama I didn't think much of it. The first 2 episodes were really boring (no need to watch them btw) and I thought it would be a cheesy comedy series. And boy was I wrong. It has so much depth and the show will never go dry in my opinion. Give it at least 1 season (49 episodes). I know its a lot but when a show has 10,000 5 star ratings it has to be pretty damn good lol.",5
gintama,"The most-fun television show I've ever had the pleasure of watching.Not just in Anime.Television.You'll fall in love with almost every character, and their recurring gags.If you like your anime incredibly serious with an enthralling story, and the most heroic of protagonists....then maybe this isn't for you - the author is a gorilla, after all.However, if you enjoy solid character development and laughing until you hurt.Then please stop reading this and watch Kin-..... Gintama start to finish.Don't forget the pickled sea-weed.",5
gintama,"Best show eva made. Let me just say that this is the first anime that I've watched 200+ episodes with. It knows how make you feel mixed emotions in almost every episode. The characters....I love every character in this show and that's a surprise to me cause I usually don't like at least one person who is too annoying or mean in a show. The thing about this show is that they all can be mean or annoying in the show..........but good annoying!!XD The genre.....this show has basically all the genre, it has comedy, action, horror, drama, a little bit of romance, etc. I don't think I'll ever get tired of this show because it's so different. You'll never know what would happen next.",5
gintama,"If you barely going to start watching, don't judge the anime based on the first or second episode. I feel that with this anime you need to watch at least three or four episodes before deciding if you like or not. While the first season may be all comedy, it really starts to heat up after the second season and so on but most of it will just be one shot comedy. There is hardly any plot involved so if you are watching for the plot, you will hardly see any but that doesn't mean the anime isn't good. The serious story arcs make for very good memorable moments  This anime is best suited for people that enjoy tons of comedy with some intense fights in the middle. This is one of my all time favorite animes and I hope whoever is reading this enjoys it too.",5
gintama,"This review is half story and half review.  I truly love this anime from the bottom of my heart so I wanted to share my experience first then give it a review after.Once upon a time, a young anime nerd was tired from work and came home only to see that none of his anime had new episodes because it was Golden Week.  Sad, bored and without plans for the night, he decided to see if there were any other series' worth picking up.  Suddenly there it was.  1 episode of Gintama on the whole site.  Episode 75.I thought to myself, ""Weird.  I'm a pretty avid anime fan but I've never heard of this.""It was destiny.  It happened to be a recap episode.  Something I would hate if I was already following the show but for someone new, it caught my attention.""This seems pretty funny.  I'll give it a look.""I was not ready.By that time, the anime was about 110 episodes deep.  I started from episode 1 and worked my way to the end in a just under a week.  I laughed, I cried, I got hype and I became hooked.  Gintama became my absolute favorite anime of all time in a few days.  Nothing was even close.Back then only Rumbel Subs did Gintama.  No one wanted a piece of that.  It was too dialogue heavy with lots of slang and figures of speech.  When Crunchyroll announced Gintama as one of their marquee titles when they launched their pay service, I immediately signed up.  That was in 08.  It's 2015 today and despite Gintama not airing the entire time, I kept my membership active.  I've enjoyed other anime here since, but I kept paying because of Gintama.As for my review of Gintama, what's there to say?  It's brilliant.  I've never seen a piece of work like this that can tap into every single feeling.  I've cheered.  Loudly.  I've cried literal tears of both sadness and happiness.  I've gotten angry at characters' inaction because they felt weak.  I've felt empowered when they overcame obstacles.  Most importantly and most frequently, I've laughed my ass off.  So hard.  I've laughed so hard that people looked at me like I was a lunatic.That's what Gintama is.  It's the extreme of every emotion.  It's absurdity that's grounded.  Random, yet calculated.  It's morality without presumption.  It's action without fear.  It isn't just an anime or manga.  It's the soul of the writer given life by amazing characters, story arcs, and profound messages mixed into it's hilarious wit.  It constantly changes the game.  It breaks barriers.  It goes places that other anime won't dare go to.  It makes fun of the stuff no one talks about.  It gives new outlook on things you already know and it touches your soul.This has been my favorite work for over 8 years.  Nothing compares.  What's weird is that, it's about 90% filler.  It's gut busting comedy.  A mix of wit, slapstick, shock and awesome placement of references from other anime, popular or not.  Suddenly out of nowhere, that 10% happens.  Action that rivals the best battle anime out there.  Stories that leave you speechless and deep in thought.  Tragedy that makes you appreciate your life more.  Triumph that makes you want to go out and achieve.I'll admit, the first handful of episodes start off slow.  I feel like the author was just getting a feel for his work and then he suddenly poured everything into it.  Please give it a chance despite it's slow start.Perhaps this is a lot more for me than it is for anyone else, but that's how much I love this show.  If you get half of what I get out of it, you'll love it.  If not, hey, at least you'll laugh your ass off.",5
gintama,"The first 50 episodes or os is bad but at least reach episode 100 before rating because it's started out really horrible in my opinion, I'm not sure if it's because I wasn't used to it's kind of comedy yet or just because it did start out boring but after awhile, I found it as my favorite anime. .Why I liked it. 1.) It has very strong female characters that most animes don't have. (Not saying that no other anime has strong female characters)2.) All of the characters all connects like strings.3.) Each character is unique and funny in their own ways.4.) This anime seems plotless but the plot is silver despite starting out cliche, for example, Takasugi and Gintoki used to be comrades but are now enemies, that's plenty enough cliche but Sorachi makes it so that it seems unique as if it was a fresh idea and not something similar to anything else.5.) Character development. Every character has their time to shine. Even the characters that hardly shows up in the anime.This anime is often just comedy but when the arc comes, it's an epicness and feels overload.",5
gintama,"Gintama has everything. It could be classified as so many genres. It has action, comedy, romance, great characters and story-line, etc. And yet it still manages to be better than any other anime with all those things. It quickly became my favourite anime, and I have seen everything from Hunter X Hunter to Kara No Kyoukai to Berserk to Magi to Durarara!! But Gintama never gets old and never fails to surprise me. Gintama is number ONE!!!",5
gintama,"TLDR; Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideGintama is certainly a piece that I would recommend. Do not waver at the large amount of episodes. The first few may be slightly off-putting to some, however KEEP WATCHING. It will be worth it, I promise. Great balance of comedy and action, comfortable shifts to heart-wrenching scenes, beautiful characters, unarguably a wonderful show that you will certainly enjoy. Ah yes Gintama, notorious for all of its gut-busting humor, badass fight scenes, and tear-jerking moments.There are times where at one point i'd be laughing my ass off, only to be on the verge of tears moments later, I kid you not. There are many reasons why this show is amazing, so let's take a look at them.1. The setting.  Gintama takes place during the Edo time Period in Japan. However, aliens have inhabited Japan and the ways of the samurai have died out. Let's also not forget to mention that at this point there is advanced technology.2. The characters. Gintama has a wide array of characters, and each and every one of them is significant to the show. A silver-haired samurai with naturally curly hair, a cute but excessively strong alien girl, a stalker gorilla cop, a (sado)masochistic assassin, a wanted terrorist (who happens to be unbelievably stupid), etc. Each character has their own ties connecting them to each other, and they all have well-thought out (often sad) backstories. The characters are not boring pieces of cardboard with flat and cliche personalities. This includes the antagonists. They all have some type of reason for what they're doing and it isn't just ""muahaha I'm doing this because I'm evil"". I personally love almost every character in this anime.3.  It's ability to easily shift from vulgar and comedic, to deep and emotional.(And Vice-Versa) Gintama is easily one of the funniest animes I've seen. But despite the first few episodes showcasing pure comedy,  It is so much more than that.  Gintama does not only have comedy, but also includes very deep and emotional episodes. Episodes that will literally make me cry my eyes out, the type of episode you would not expect after several d*ck jokes. Don't worry, Gintama has amazing action arcs too. After watching Gintama, I have found that they have done a more exceptional job delivering Action than many Shounen-Action animes. 4. Hilarious Parodies.Yes, you knew it was coming. This is one of the aspects of Gintama everyone knows about. Nothing is safe from being parodied by Gintama. There are far too many references to name, however expect Gintama to Joke about your favorite animes. I would also like to add that the Gintama staff just loves trolling its fans.Those are the main things I had thought I should mention, but I'd also like to talk about the Art, Animation, and Sound.Art- I enjoy the art. The highlight of it would be the hilarious(and occasionally badass) expressions the characters make, I'd say the art is fairly good. To me it sets the mood pretty well.Animation- The animation is okay, not much to say about it.Sound- Wonderful OSTs. Memorable and appropriately placed. Some of the Openings were not memorable, however there are several that easily stick in my mind. Endings were okay as well. Didn't remember most of them.----------In conclusion, Gintama is certainly a piece that I would recommend. Do not waver at the large amount of episodes. The first few may be slightly off-putting to some, however KEEP WATCHING. It will be worth it, I promise. Great balance of comedy and action, comfortable shifts to heart-wrenching scenes, beautiful characters, unarguably a wonderful show that you will certainly enjoy.",5
gintama,"Gintama is, in a word, brilliant. Honestly, it took me a long time to start watching this show because it didn't sound interesting and didn't look like anything special. However, after I started there was no stopping. Some other reviews have said as much, but the first few episodes are somewhat slow. After I went back and watched them again, I realized each episode is basically a character introduction and the source of many ongoing jokes.This show is predominantly a comedy. It has every kind of humor imaginable, from parodies to scatalogical jokes. Beneath all the humor though is the true brilliance of Gintama. The serious arcs are epic - recall this is shonen - and the character development is outstanding. Some story arcs will end with a good laugh, others with tears, but it always feels right. This is what separates Gintama from other shonen: Sorachi is a master of creating a story that plays on every emotion. It isn't all laughs, and it isn't all excitement and fighting. Whatever the feeling is, it is done so well it can't be adequately described in words. You just have to experience it yourself. No other anime I have watched has made me feel such a wide range of emotions. No other anime has such perfectly human characters who you can believe are real people. This is one anime you will wish would never end.Underlying all of that is a slowly building plot. Yes, Gintama has plot, though sometimes it's easy to forget as it moves from one goofy arc to the next (with a few epic battles scattered throughout). It's like a darkness churning under the everyday humor, mishaps, and adventures. Truly, there are so many layers to Gintama that no review can do it justice. This anime is a rare gem with brilliantly original characters, finely told stories, and a whole lot of heart.",5
gintama,"I believe decades from now Gintama will be remembered as a legendary timeless classic. No other anime like it, Gintama is one of the few anime that can make you go from laughing from it's hilarious momemnts to shedding tears in the same episode. This anime has everything that makes any piece of entertainment engaging. In this amazing journey you will laugh, cry, be inspired, watch amazing action set pieces and marvel in this delicious world of Gintama. Just a warning Gintama starts a little slow, introducing characters and setting up the world but it's a small price to pay for such amazing experience it will provide. Must watch for all anime fans!!",5
gintama,As a fan of the big 3 and several anime there not a single one of them that can ever compare to Gintama.I was skeptical reading at the description and scores that is getting But after catching up I realized that i was rightThe scores did not give it justiceIt deserved WAYYY MORREEEI dont think that there will be any review that will explain the greatness that is Gintamaso i can only say WATCH IT and you will understand .,5
gintama,"In honor of the new season coming out, I've decided to write a review. I have very high opinions of this show, and as you can tell from the title and the rating, this is without a doubt one of the most hilarious shows I've ever seen.The show centers around three main characters, and their business Odd Jobs Gin where they'll take on any job for the right price. These jobs can include anything from helping a sushi restaurant to investigating a crime scene, giving the show nearly limitless options.As I mentioned, there are three main characters. These are:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Gintoki Sakata- He's the leader of Odd Jobs Gin and is a former war hero. 20 years before the events of the show, aliens called Amanto invaded earth and humans didn't want them there. Many people took up arms, including Gintoki. This is important, as it's where he gets his master sword skills from and many of his past allies from the war now belong to an Anti-Foreigner Faction, numerous terrorist groups that still fight against the Amanto government.Shinpachi Shimura- He's the ""straight man"" in the show. He starts working for Gintoki after getting fired from his old job, and he's a hardcore otaku nerd (kind of like many of the shows viewers including myself). He and his sister share the goal of rebuilding their father's dojo.Kagura Yato-  A girl who is part of one of the strongest warrior races in the universe. She loves pickled seaweed and her over sized dog Sadaharu (the 27th). She uses an umbrella that also acts as a machine gun for a weapon... it's pretty cool. Though her father has appeared in the show, Gintoki acts as a father figure for her. Like Shinpachi she works for Odd Jobs Gin, but unlike him she also lives there.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The show contains many other well-written characters and stories, and you never know where each episode will take you. Though it's a comedy first and foremost, it has many touching scenes and arcs- as well as some awesome battles (I'm looking at you Benizakura and Yoshiwara is Burning arcs). Something however that can for some reason be a turn off to people is that it has many fourth wall breaks and references. These are personally one of the main reasons I love the show, but be warned if you don't like those.Overall, I'd recommend this anime to anyone, and you, the reader of this review, are no exception. Though the first few episodes were actually kind of slow in my opinion, by the time I hit episode 10 I couldn't stop laughing.WARNING: THIS SHOW CONTAINS VERY CATCHY OPENINGS. BE PREPARED TO START HUMMING THEM UNCONSCIOUSLY IN PUBLIC.",5
gintama,"Gintama means the world to me and all these experiences and feels, and the way it's moved me and made my world a little brighter cannot be put into words.People think Gintama has no substance. Ha! Let me just say if you dropped Gintama before the 50s. You don't know Gintama. If you dropped it before the 100 mark you really don't know Gintama. You think you know it and then it in the 100-200+ but by 260 it's a whole new level and with layers of depth.It doesn't take 50 eps to get good like people say. It's the way it is, does nothing wrong, It's just a matter of hit or miss. And without the earlier build up and settings the 'great arc' that come later are just okay shounen. Gintama's so hard to describe but it has all of my being and all of my heart.Thank you Sunrise, Thank you to the Voice cast and to all the staff, but most especially, Thank you Sorachi Hideaki. Your work means the world to me.",5
gintama,"If you like tons (and I really mean it by ""tons"") of comedy with a perfect mix of action, Gintama is definitely the anime for you. Though many of the episodes are stories on their own, Gintama does follow a plot line throughout the series. If you have a short attention span and prefer simpler plots (versus anime like Bleach or Naruto), it consists of a series of many short arcs or episodes on their own, with the arcs lasting about 2-5 episodes per. Comedy wise, based on personal viewership, it is the MOST troll anime I've ever watched. Like, on a completely different scale. The producers love to screw with you so much (in a good way) but this seemingly strange quality is definitely why I've stuck with Gintama for so long. You probably don't get it right now but they are some episodes that'll just make your mind explode. In addition, Gintama will have you rolling on the ground laughing your guts out one second, but the next second you'll be bawling. Though it may seem like this anime is the kind with a rushed plot, it does an amazing job at transitioning viewers through many different emotions and stories. Hideaki (author) and the producers do a fine job of timing the revealing of the characters' traits/histories throughout the series. Lastly, as a musician, I do wish to pay my respects to the musical portion, if you're interested in that part of anime. The openings and endings are generally quite catchy and the animations fit nicely with the music and plot. Often times, especially with this anime, it is to your benefit to watch through the credits as what follows may or may not contribute to the plot. Though Gintama has a fairly low viewership in other countries, it is widely popular in Japan. You've probably heard this over and over again from other anime crazed fans, but honestly Gintama is an extremely underrated anime. The plot, characters, and comedy are weaved together in such a perfect blend, with tons of comedy balanced with the brief but substantial moments where characters are revealed, gradually drawing the you in as you learn the deeper connections behind each profound personality. Gintama is truly a hidden and polished gem in the anime world. If you've read through this whole review, thank you for your generous time. Hope this helps in your endeavor for anime of your interest. Sincerely, One with a tremendous passion for anime and the like",5
gintama,"Gintama, an anime that lacks attention outside japan and an anime extremely worth watching.Gintama is definitely an anime of its kind, excluding itself into its very own genre which holds very little anime. Gintama lays out an forever expanding universe (very much like one piece, but gintama doesn't explore it) filled with excellent written characters. The show is Shounen, while its jokes are very mature, and the show completely strays from the long and boring anime fights which plagues shows like Naruto and One Piece.The lack of fight makes the little fights that exists in Gintama extremely worth watching and re-watching. This is not the only excellent feature of Gintama, it's reference to anime series, manga series and game is excellent! Those who are experienced with old school anime(Gundam 0079, Doraemon) to new anime (Bleach, Sket Dance) will enjoy the anime more through references and jokes! Gintama is also filled with characters that are well written and worthy of their own show.Gintama arcs are very short, yet they leave a very nice after taste that last longer than some of the extreme long arcs from other WSJ shows.Nearly every episode outside of major arcs is episodic and filled with excellent jokes. The animation of Gintama in the beginning is decent, and as it began its second series and third series, the animation was bumped up further making it one of the more excelltly animated shows out there! (Sasuga Sunrise!)But is Gintama without it's flaws? Of course, no anime is without flaws. Gintama suffers from its slow build up of the series, a major amount of atleast 50-70 episode of the original 200 episode is no where near as good as the rest. Also Gintama is only excellent to those who are experienced with anime, therefore understanding the references which makes the show so good. Therefore it is not a new anime fan friendly show.In conclusion, there is not much to say besides that once you have seen most of the Gundam anime, most of the WSJ anime and mangas and old animes. You are set for the ride that will be in your mind forever!",5
gintama,"When I first watched this show I really didn't know what to think going into it.  The picture on Crunchyroll looked good so I gave it a shot.  By the end of the first episode, I was laughing my ass off and I realized I was hooked.  Throughout the entire run of the show, I was always made to laugh, even when the subject of the episode was decidedly sad.  The show is goofy and serious all at the same time and I highly recommend it for anyone who is in the mood for something fun.",5
gintama,"One of the deepest,Brilliantly thought out,Emotional jerking,Most epic fight scene,Funniest humored, Anime.The characters all have great personalities.And the humor is really a marvel.Then the serious arcs are very captivating and Immersive.Rating:Characters: 9/10Story/Plot: 8.5/10Setting: 9.5/10Animation: 8/10 - (10/10 on serious arcs)Sound: 9/10 - (9.5/10 on serious arcs) (OST, Openings and Endings get a 9/10)Overall: 4.9/5 Stars.PS- By all means, i have not overrated nor underrated this series.",5
gintama,"Okay so I'm sure that other people have thought this too but Gintoki is extremely messed up, he has some major issues mentally because of his involvement in the Amanto War.  The first and most obvious symptom is his tendency to attempt to solve everything alone as well as the fact that until Kagura and ""Glasses"" showed up he didn't associate with anyone long-term for fear of losing them.  However this personality trait is most obvious during the varied ""serious"" arcs throughout the show.  The second, but slightly less obvious symptom is his attempt to make EVERYTHING silly, he's always making joke's or getting into ridiculous situations but the one thing that never changes during these comedic moments is the ""Dead Fish Eye's"" he has.  He's just doing all of that fun stuff to try and forget the enormous amount of emotional pain he is in.  This is further cemented by the fact that his eye's only show any life when he is fighting/getting the crap beat out of him/beating the crap out of bad guys, by doing that he is able to drown in the fighting and momentarily forget in a way that even silliness can't do for him.  Of course this pain and general instability is not only confined to Gintoki, all four of the main fighter's of the Amanto War are extremely unstable.  We have Gintoki that is doing his best to forget, Zura, I mean Katsura that is trying to preserve, Takasugi that is trying to erase or destroy and Sakamoto that is running away.",5
gintama,"Gintama is one of the big four in anime! (Naruto, One Piece, Bleach and Gintama!) and it should deserve to be number one!  Gintama offers comedy, action, drama and lots and lots of mayonnaise! The start may be a bit confusing but after 5 episodes it will leave you completely hooked and wanting for more! I started watching a month ago and I'm almost done the entire series! Watch it, you won't regret it!",5
gintama,"Seriously.  No words I can say will be sufficient enough to explain this masterpiece if you haven't seen it already.  But I'll give it a try anyway.The plot revolves around The Odd Jobs crew, Gintoki, a samurai who is the definition of an honorable man; while at the same time being the definition of what kids shouldn't aspire to be, in a comedic way.  Kagura, the cute but surprisingly rude, strong, but surprisingly clueless, and kind, but surprisingly immature heroine.  Shinpachi, the straight man who's job (narrative) is to retort to the randomness of this world around him, which is a suprisingly important role in this insane story.  Plus a whole cast of other whacky characters that you will get to know and love.  There are many reviews already who explain the plot much better, so I'll get to what I think of the Anime myself.Immature, random, and stupidly hilarious, mixed in with the most touching moments in Anime history, topped off with amazingly animated actions scenes on rare occasions.  The humor is crude, the references, shameless.  They've parodied every stereotypical genre, and do a damn good job at it.The story itself is very self-aware, constantly breaking the fourth wall and explaining the plot through a narrative.It may be a bit slow in the beginning, I have to admit, which is why it's recommended to start with a few episodes before making your decisions.  Either the Anime grows on you immensely and you assimilate into it's world and it's humor, or the show itself evolves constantly to grow funnier every episode.  Either, way, it's worth sticking around 200+ episodes.And the great thing is that it's not a linear plot, so there's no 10 episode cliffhanger where you NEED to know what happens next.  You can watch it casually over time, and slowly enjoy it like a succulent candy that must be savored.  Of course, just because it's an episodic Anime, it doesn't mean it will stop you from wanting to watch the rest.  In fact, it may even make you want to watch all of the episodes in one go, just because of how brilliant the momentum is in this show.  TLDR; It's hilarious, it's touching, it's characters are lovable, and the rare actions scenes are delicious.  If you put everything together on a crazy pot full of insane situations and ridiculous plots covered with copious amounts of references... You get the strange stew for the soul called Gintama.  And it's wonderful.",5
gintama,"Gintama is an odd anime, unlike most shows that stick with a small amount of characters, Gintama grows and adapts. Yes there are four main characters, Gintoki, Shinpachi, Kagura, and Sadaharu, but all of the other characters aren't just one time appearances. They become part of the series as if they too mattered and they do matter. There will be episodes that focus on these ""side"" characters and because Gintama focuses on more than just the main characters you get a richer more full world. You don't get repetitive comedy, you get fresh new jokes with fresh new characters. Each character has a important background, each character is interesting, whether it is the homeless man in underwear or the Ramen shop owner. The series has a sense of community. I've yet to see a character that doesn't reappear. Gintama is also very parody rich, it parodies other anime, games, shows, American tv and movies. Whether it's Dragonbleapiece, or Pretty Cure, you are sure to have a laugh.Gintama also has serious moments and surprisingly an actual plot of sorts. Whenever you reach these 2-6 episode serious moments you will enjoy them, then it goes back into its fun loving normal self. Gintoki and his crew always help out someone in need and seeing the various people they help and the stories of this world in which Gintama resides is very interesting, inspiring, and fun. Some of my favorite quotes come from Gintama. Whether serious ""Fight on and those cold fingers will be warmed by the heart of another,"" or the speech about Strawberry milk.The main reason I love this series is because it is really fun to watch, whether it is Okita and Hiijikata bickering, or Gintoki and the crew being ridiculous. All of the characters are fun, there was an episode about the homeless man named Madao and even though none of the main characters showed up it was hilarious. Gintama does start off slowly though, which is why I know very few people offline who watch it, so I recommend starting at episode 3 where they actually introduce the characters in the timeline. 1 and 2 are kind of out of place and frustrate people who aren't patient. I know Gintama isn't everyone's cup of tea, but if you like anime it is worth a shot!",5
gintama,"This anime left me speechless.. It covers everything! Comedy, romance, horror, action, adventure, robots.. whatever comes in your mind.I really can't express how much I love this anime. Compared to other long-series such as naruto, bleach or one-piece, this is the best!From all of my heart, I wish this anime never ends, and I wish if I could ask for more!I never thought of sharing my opinion about any anime; even though I saw many great animes that deserved to be commented on. However, this is my first review of Gintama just because I would like to show how amazing this anime is!If you did not watch Gintama, then I don't know why you're watching other animes.",5
twin-star-exorcists,"The premise isn't anything we haven't seen before, and I'm not a fan of featuring overly young characters facing mortal peril, but despite these very snap judgments, this anime managed to hold my interest throughout the first episode. The world jumping is handled in a very stylish way and the deliberate style shifting right before a character uses a special attack just drips with artistic flare that isn't seen in a lot of series. Sure, I feel like the anime is prompting me to prepare to hit a button, but it's a nice touch that shows that the studio wanted to put forth just a little more effort than normal to stand out.Downside: So far, the Japanese Female Oppression Beam is alive and well in this series. We're properly introduced first to our main female protagonist, but as this is a shonen series, naturally she has to be eclipsed by the male lead, because having a female lead that's stronger than the male in combat would make his dick fall off or something. On the upside, however, despite her seemingly cold personality, it's clear she cares deeply about people and she's allowed to be just as weird and quirky as the male lead, showing that she's not some stuck up, sneering superior tsundere. She's got her own vices and things that reveal that she's just as much a typical selfish kid as the male protagonist. At first, the character interactions are eye rollingly expected, but quickly the characters show that they've got more to them than a one-note personality and more than one emotional state, at least by shonen standards. When comparing to the likes of the big names in shonen anime, it looks also like this series will be able to keep a proper pace up, and not go meandering around useless story arcs. The art direction alone is enough to keep me coming back regardless of how much the plot wanders. The appearance of the demon world and attention to lighting is very inspired and crisp, on the level I would expect from a medium budget feature movie. It's clear that they're trying to stand out from the crowd, and I appreciate that. Keep an eye on this series. While super young characters aren't my thing, it still managed to keep me entertained, and I'm interested in seeing how the story ultimately plays out, as long as it doesn't succumb to typical shonen drag, which I doubt it will because of the production values involved. This is definitely not a cheap series to produce, so they're not going to waste money on unnecessary filler arcs.",4
twin-star-exorcists,"It's not the generic shounen manga setting that bothers me. It's not the rehashed trope of teenagers blowing stuff up while in so called mortal peril, even though their plot armor is thicker than the soviet IS-4 tank's steel plating, either.What ultimately sets me off is how mediocre the execution is, as an anime. Not having read any of the manga, I'm not one to judge how the work is as a whole, but the show is somewhat painful to watch.I want to love the show, I really do. I'm a huge sucker for action/revenge/supernatural stuff with a sprinkle of dark pasts, but there are moments where I'm seriously left wondering how much effort actually went into this adaptation, in moments such as the obligatory ""walking in on a showering girl"" scene, the unnecessary and extremely annoying little... creature.... thing..., the frustratingly stale delivery of character emotion, and frankly quite confusing interactions. Okay I'll admit the last two are very subjective but my point still stands and these four aren't the only issues.I also cannot exactly say I agree with the graphic design choices, and the battle scenes are somewhat reminiscent of battle cartoons aimed at toddlers, but hey. I though that about world trigger at first but I grew to love that show.Ultimately it's not very clear cut whether you should watch this or not. I recommend against it if you've already seen a lot of shows like this (or not even, it's a marginal difference), since the small details like out of place fan-service and rehashed scenarios are much more annoying the longer your history with anime is. However, if you are either new to this kind of show with 14 year old kids duking it out with monsters using really funny looking weapons, it might not actually be a terrible experience. I for one remember enjoying a lot of crappy shows for no other reason than because I liked some small aspect of it.",3
twin-star-exorcists,"Here is where the rubber meets the road. This is so formulaic its kind of nauseating to people like me who have been watching anime since the early 90's. I am not speaking for all veterans of anime of course, but its been a common complaint among my circle. Typical characters and arcs as well as ""shipping wars"" among fans made me look away. Even still, I hung out until the end of the last big arc before the time skip. It was watchable while I waited for my other shows to update. Heck, I even liked it and the action was pretty cool.Then it just fell flat and characters were regressing not progressing. I just lost interest. Final verdict? GREAT SHOW for anime beginners. Seriously hits all the sweet spots for first timers. Might not do it for those of us that have seen it all before. Your mileage may vary though. Ken out.",3
twin-star-exorcists,"Currently viewed 10 episodes at the time of writing this review...When I first started to watch this show I remember thinking just how cliched it was... yet I still watched it regularly, before I knew it it was a show I looked forward to it every week. Cliched shows are only cliched because they have a popular style which appeals to viewers again and again right? I mean, thats the reason why the typical shonen cliches exist in the first place, because they remain popular, and sell volumes / DVD's... a proven fact.The characters are not very unique, but are still quite relatable, the MC Rokuro has a typical tragic back story which gives you a better understanding of the reasons he has for his lifestyle choices and decision making. Benio I have to say.. I'm not the biggest fan of (Mayura is best girl <3), but she serves her purpose, and you do warm up to her in the end. The Familiar.... shall I go there?? ... its probably my most hated familiar EVER (Kuro-chan for life), I literally cannot stand the stupid thing, it has absolutely no relevance to the story and has the most annoying personality and voice, I dont understand why Studio Pierrot thought it'd be a good idea to include it. The pacing of this show is very good (sort of), it starts slow, then speeds up a bit then WHAM gets very dark very suddenly, it totally sucks you in... and then it fizzles out...It was at this point where things got pretty dark that I absolutely couldn't wait a week to find out what happens next that I picked up the Manga.... this is how I ruined this show for myself. I literally used to hate people who would come across as manga hipsters on the comments and reviews... but oh God I've turned into one of those. Seriously this anime adaptation cant shake a stick at the far superior manga. All of the tense built up elements of the manga seem to have been brushed aside or not covered in enough depth in the anime. Very important elements and battles have been completely cut out, and the character development doesn't even compare. I actually really love Benio in the manga, she actually comes across as human, not just some robotic, ohagi-obsessed exorcist chick who has no social skills. Plus her and Rokuro's relationship is so much more complex (I ship them). In fact the anime pretty much follows a completely different (and inferior) storyline at some points, it just seems like they've made a third of the episodes as fillers. Don't even get me started on episode 10!!! like seriously, episode 9 something pretty major happens, and the next episode doesn't even mention anything about it, let alone progress further with the plot, its just filler. The only thing that redeemed it was bread crust mans facial expressions.Basically... this is why I've ruined this show for myself, which makes me quite sad as I was enjoying it up until that point.therefore I advise anyone wanting to watch this show to not read the manga until you have completed the anime, and if you are planning to watch this and you are already familiar with the manga please don't start watching expecting too much of it as you will be disappointed.",2
twin-star-exorcists,"To begin, even though I rated this 5 stars, I am actually rating it a 4.5, but that's not possible with the click the star rating system so I rounded up.Now, it has been awhile since any show has had me as stoked as Twin Star Exorcists. Not since The Irregular at Magic High School and Sword Art Online have I been invested in characters the way I am now. I am getting up early every Wednesday just to watch this show. With that said, I'd like to discuss the aspects of it.Story: The fundamental part of every story in every culture is the plot. The plot here is pretty simple. The world is plagued by Kegare who feed upon humans secretly from an alternate and parallel reality called Megano. Exorsists exist to purify Kegare corruption sites and wipe Kegare out where they appear to feed on humans. A prophecy exists that speaks of the Miko, an all powerful Exorcist who will destroy all Kegare and Megano entirely, thus freeing humanity from the threat.This story is not about the Miko at all. Rather, an oracle has declared two teenage Exorcists to be the Twin Star Exorcists, two powerful exorcists who's union will bring forth the Miko. This is the story of Enmadou Rokuro and Adashino Benio, the twin star exorcists who quite frankly, do not get along and are forced into an arranged relationship of sorts by leading exorcists and the trials they must overcome together. Because this is not really about a ""chosen one,"" and is instead about making sure the chosen one can make it to the world, I have to give it extra points. 5/5. Characters: No good story can advance without good characters and a strong supporting cast. This anime...has 3/4 of that. Rokuro and Benio, at least at first, appear to be overpowered walking tropes. But this show really digs into their characters and they grow from two dimensional characters into well-rounded, strong characters with personalities, abilities, complexities and weaknesses that truly make up memorable and lovable characters. It also shows that they are not, in fact overpowered by a ridiculous amount. Rather, they have a lot more power than other exorcists their age, but they still have a lot to learn and there are exorcists, and even enemies, a lot more powerful than they are. A lot of the supporting cast fit in perfectly well, from Ryogo, Rokuro's adopted-but-not-really brother figure to Mayura, Rokuro's childhood friend who has a crush on him but is best friends with Benio and is not afraid to tell Rokuro how useless he is. The leader of the exorcists is an eccentric but excitable man who is determined to get the Miko into the world and happily puts the two through one embarrassing moment after another, to my great amusement.However, other members of the supporting cast fail miserably. Benio's grandmother and Mayura's grandfather are entirely forgettable in the show, and Benio's familiar Kiniko, seems to have only one purpose in the series. Annoy the viewers. This familar is largely the only reason I cannot rate the characters a full 5/5. He's too annoying and overused. His sole purpose in the show is to make fun Rokuro and yell loudly when he senses nearby Kegare. His whole purpose in the show is really to draw attention to a fight about to happen in an annoying way. Benio, for all our sakes, dump him, soon. 3.5/5. Kiniko, you dropped the character score down by 1.5 points by yourself! Be ashamed.Action: I really enjoy watching the action scenes. It's well choreographed, well-animated, and it does not shy away from the nitty-gritty. Gorey and dark but also fluffy and lighthearted enough to keep it from getting depressing.However, a few of the fights are pretty....bland. Seeing Benio's old master summon some guns and wiping out Kegare by the score should have been a lot more exciting than it was. The Kegare just stood there laughing and let themselves get shot. I think it was supposed to show how powerful she was, but it really just looked like target practice and no real threat was there. So for action I give it 4/5. Music: 5/5, nuff said. Fits really well and helps set up the mood. Overall I give this anime a 4.5 out of 5.",3
twin-star-exorcists,"I was really feeling this show at the beginning, then midway (ep. 8-11ish)  I was not too sure to be honest, but I stuck with it, cause, well, why not? Still had potential. Plus someone had mentioned it was going to get 50 or so episodes, so I figured it was slow because the show is being set up. Well  the latest episode was AMAZING. So fingers crossed.  Here's the thing, the episodes for the show are actually very well paced! They don't leave you in suspense all the time and a lot of information gets across. I love that the show tends to resolve it's current issue in a single episode, then moves on. It doesn't pull the whole, ""Hey, here's an issue, let's finish the episode RIGHT before this gets resolve, and ADD ANOTHER issue on top of it...and leave the viewers hanging for another week"" Another Plus: The story is picking up! I can see a lot of potential for the characters. I'm not just talking about Benio and Roku. I'm talking about the side character! Yes the side characters, who I actually don't think are just simple side characters. I think these other characters are going to get some good development, like Mayura and her dad. Update: I think it goes into fillers and it loses steam.....if it's not filler, then the episodes were not as good as they could've been. So in summaryPros:-Great Pacing-Huge Potential for the Story and it IS picking up-Compelling main & side characters that are developing nicely. Some might even surprise us!-Amazing Art Style-Good Comedy-Great ActionCons:-I'm not a fan of Benio. She started out awesome, but seems to be losing momentum!  But I'm hoping this is all due to her coming development. -Benio's pet (For Reals....) :/  It doesn't get any better....UPDATE: Yes, Benio losing momentum was DEF due to upcoming character development, but I think then it goes to filler, so the show loses momentum again.",5
twin-star-exorcists,"Over the course of the first 5 episodes I thought was extremely stereotypical with the main character being a hot headed, immature, OP, loud, Naruto/Natsu cutout. Turns out he eventually grows out of his 14 year old shell and takes on the responsibility of becoming a young adult trying to save the world from Kegare (demons). The female protagonist also impressively evolved throughout the show. Her personality slowly matures to a point that her ""cutout"" personality becomes something of a base of the soup rather than the main course. Whats unique about this show is that as they evolve together, they truly begin to understand each other in ways many other anime friendships can never achieve. This show is definitely something where you may have to wait to see a good solid plot progression. Especially since in the beginning it feels a little cliche in many aspects such as constant flashbacks, character cutouts, plot stagnancy, and rather poor soundtrack. However, as you stick with it, you will begin to feel a sense of overcoming all of these cliche barriers as well as inseparable bonds between characters being formed. To be honest, this show barely deserves a 5 star rating. But because it portrayed character development so well on top of creating a good reason to like the characters, I want to further promote this show to others by giving it a solid 5 stars.",5
twin-star-exorcists,this adaptation of the manga follows next to none of the source material. they left out huge antagonists and decided to add pointless familiars. the manga doesnt have half of this romcom bs going on it either. im not sure what they were thinking when they wrote this anime but the manga author should be pissed.i guess its a decent show if you havent read the manga. but i would highly recommend the manga if you enjoy this joke of an anime,5
twin-star-exorcists,"I'm going to establish first that i'm not really too big of a fan of these types of ""exorcist"" series because I feel a lot of the writing is lazy. An example is that there are no rules established to what spell power is so it's a very abstract concept within the world. Spell power is introduced into this world as something you could build up by gaining stamina to use more than one talisman and this idea becomes dismissed as the series goes on. Most talismans become irrelevant due to the cursed power forged through contract with the kegares. After a while this show becomes fairly predictable. Throughout my watch I'd say it was fairly underwhelming. Some of my reasons will contain spoilers, you've been warned.Pros++Yuto Ijika. He is a character you love to hate or hate to love depending on the impression this series left you with. The only thing that annoys me is there isn't much insight into why he does the things he does. They painted him more chaotic evil where i think he actually falls more on being chaotic neutral.+The animated zoom-ins when they use signature abilities and the way they sequence introductions seems pretty cool.+Wagakki Band getting more exposure.+For the most part, pretty stylized and nicely done animation.+Although i'm not a fan of exorcist series, seems like a good series for someone younger and new to start on.+Ohagi man.Neutral+-+-Music Choice. For the most parts you become accustomed to hearing some of the music and realize it sets the pace but some of it didn't do it's job as well. Also suzu's metal music was pure cringe.+-For what it was this series feels super drawn out. The pacing isn't great and it always seems like they try to dip their toes on side characters but play them down to the point where it makes you wonder why you should care. They played Kuranashi to be this big bad mofo and he gets squished extremely fast.+-The 12 guardians. Love half their designs, hate half their designs. Not a fan of the ""edgy DA OC"" Shimon. Most of them are completely untouched/unknown until you get to the Kuranashi arc.Only like 3 of them show their special form.Cons--Kinako. One of the most annoying side characters, they even dedicated a whole episode to this rodent.-A lot of seemingly important plots don't pan out such as Kamui disappears for like 30 episodes, i would think he would be the stepping stone to fighting Kuranashi. Speaking of which..-The Kuranashi Arc: it was pretty disappointing. it seemed like he would be the anti-exorcist based on when abe made the tree and when he spawned. For someone that had lived a century he's tricked quite easily by a 16 year old boy.-Mayura doesn't inherit the tiger talisman from Seigen. I think she would be more relevant to the series if she not only inherited it but was also acknowledged by the head exorcist to be worthy.-Signature moves. When you see the 12 guardians use their signature moves it leaves an impression of their strength. You nearly see Rokuro use astral disaster every episode and it's considered his signature move but it only ever seems to do work on low tier kegare. During the start of the series Rokuro is like the one punch man of the series. To me the funny/ironic thing was if i remember correctly Arima announces that Rokuro and Benio are the strongest exorcists and will birth the Miko. You'd think over time they'd tap more into their hidden potential but they really hard plateau and for the most part seem largely irrelevant.-This series was heavily recommended by CR and was a bit disappointing. Usually CR recommends series with pretty high potential.",3
twin-star-exorcists,"I made it episode 33 of this one so I like to think I gave it a fair chance but to be honest, I'm just not interested in seeing how it finishes.As a lot of reviews a quick to mention: this anime begins with plenty of cliches and trope right front and centre. I cannot deny that but it did one thing to start that caught my interest which is to create a love triangle that is forced on two of the characters as opposed to only one. ""Okay,"" I thought, ""So we're verring away from the harem thing probably. Let's see what you do with this.""Sadly, it does very little. The process for my has been as stylish as you can wish for but it's all flash and no susbtance.##### Minor vague spoiler warning #####At the point where I gave up: we had recently lost a character that pretty much did nothing but wimp about and do the whole ""has super duper mystery powers but no control over them nonsese"" that we get and ended up using said powers to sacrifices themself for the greater good. Nothing we haven't seen before. However, the entire primary cast is suddenly super sad about losing this character who has spent most of the time on screen together doing nothing but stumbling into combat scenes and doing ""a mystery thing"".We then find out that this character has some shared history with our main male protagonist and all about his past which lines up with the now lost character. None of this mentioned before, none of this shown. We're just meant to believe that these people formed strong bonds and had all these feelings for one another.It was at this point that I decided that I didn't care how this plot resolves. With characters whose motivation seems to turn on the point of ""because now the plot says we're going this way"" and most of the development being an excuse to get the next fight to reveal the next power level move being unlocked I am just not invested in what happens.It's far from the worst thing ever created but with other stuff sat on my queue I feel that my time will be better spent elsewhere. Watch it for the fight scenes if you have time to burn, maybe.",5
twin-star-exorcists,"If you watch this anime to the current episode, and you don't fall in love with it I think you might have something wrong with you. lol But really though, I have seen a lot of anime lately with yokai and omnioji and the like, but this one stands out. Maybe because, personally at least, I really enjoy the good feels between the MCs and the comic book-esque fighting scenes. The story and art are very well done, none of the silly screen effects like you see in some anime...All in all, I really think this is a great anime, but may be sort of an acquired taste for some. I LOVE IT, but that's just me~ x)",5
twin-star-exorcists,"There is nothing particularly essential about this show that makes it a must watch. However, it's not entirely unlikable either. The combat is mostly a series of calling out the name of a move (which is then bracketed across the screen in case you missed it) followed by a flying punch, flying kick, or energy blast. The plot and battle progression is very formulaic. So if you are looking for something to watch, you might enjoy it. But it's also pretty forgettable.",4
twin-star-exorcists,"I've only made it about 5 episodes in and I'd like to finish the series, but I just can't watch it anymore.pros: good animation, battles are interesting and exciting, I like where the story is headed.cons: The main characters are just too obnoxious. I imagine they might get better as the series goes on, but I just can't watch anymore. I found Asta's voice from Black Clover more enjoyable than the two main characters and that stupid mascot.",4
twin-star-exorcists,"This series takes a lot of inspiration from other larger and more successful anime. Shows like Bleach, Dragon Ball, Naruto etc... It tries, sometimes quite successfully to have it's own style... But nothing it does it really remarkable. The story is cliche but passable, the action... passable but nothing fantastic. The humor can be pretty good at times though.Sadly what stands out is the last segment of the show, where the writing is clearly takes a significant turn for the worse. I haven't read the manga personally, but I understand that this show veers far from it's source material, and that almost never ends well. It's not a terrible anime, I'd give it a solid C+. You can do a lot worse, but you can do a lot better too.Pros:Good musicAttack names(to explain is a spoiler, but you'll understand if you watch)Real character progression - the two lead characters definitely mature a good bit.Cons:Terrible endingInconsistent writingThat stupid mascot character has possibly the most annoying voice in any anime in the last decade.",5
twin-star-exorcists,"The beginning maybe a little slow and weird, especially considering how the main protagonist looks but once you continue thru the story the plot gets better and you find this to be a great anime. I am not one to write reviews, but I find it worthy of my time. I like how unlike any anime before it, it gives you the exorcist supernatural feel with hints of the protagonists having feelings for each other. I certainly recommend it!",3
twin-star-exorcists,"This show speaks for itself giving you no room to catch a breath, from the moment you enter you are gripped into a thriller past and thrown into a deep story line in which 2 characters meet as a part of fate and are thrown into a depth-defying future that can only be described as humorous, and dangerous. By watching each other and yet avoiding each other, this shows the truth behind friendship, love, and willpower to protect those you love. Once you enter their lives, you can't find much of a reason to leave it giving just one more show to add to that list of Anime that you just can't stop watching. I would recommend this Anime to anyone from the Beginner to the Hardcore veteran because it's just enough to keep you there while keeping you enthralled on what can only be considered a quality Anime in the making.",2
twin-star-exorcists,"It looks pretty, but that is about it.  MC kun is supposed to be haunted by a tragic past: he'll NEVER fight again! Instead of exploring themes of PTSD and overcoming adversity, he just gets over it.  This immediately sinks any promise of character development he could possibly have had.  Despite screaming about how he'll never be an exorcist again (while living and eating for free in an exorcist dorm), he still keeps his weapon with him and leaps into action to save the day like he was just being a spoilt little shit this whole time.  Worse, the female lead is supposed to be super skilled and can fight circles around MC kun.  He makes one clumsy counter-attack and everyone drops their jaw and pretends like he is unbeatable.  He hasn't even practiced in two years and didn't have that much experience before then either.  I understand red oni/blue oni pairings, I really do.  But this isn't passion Vs technique... its iron-clad plot armor Vs mastery... where we are INFORMED that MC-kun is the best after clearly seeing him outclassed.What proceeds from here are far more shounen cliches, an annoying side-kick, and not much else.  I hear the manga was awesome, and this may have gotten good after the first 5-6 episodes... but I saw no reason to stick around.",3
twin-star-exorcists,"PLZ READ ALL!!!!!Really good show but some problems I  feel are that they started off the show over powered and then in no time they are really weak. I  wished they showed more training and bonding together faster. The story moves really slow yada yada. As well as that sae girl she just pissed me off..........But anyway move the story along fast and try to portray the 2 more as a couple, instead of teens going on a first date but for the whole story which is how I feel it is. Rokuro is two uhh how do I say this without cursing..... A GIRL DOG DAMMIT....... you get the point. Benio insults him one time and he gets all sad and mad. Do not get me wrong these are just the bad parts in my opinion, its still a really good anime and I want more and for it to never end lol like most animes I enjoy I just want you guys to keep pumping out more and more. I wish I had taken my time watching it instead of binging it cuz now I'm out ;(If you took the time to read all this your amazing!!!!!!!!",5
twin-star-exorcists,"Fucking Kinako wasn't in the manga, and after episode 16 or 17, the story takes a completely different turn. It's probably because they decided to make this a 50 episodes anime, but I feel betrayed watching this way more happy story than the original. The manga had a more interesting dark tone that I come to like and that is non-existent after they made their original story. I really really wish they made this less episodes but more honest and faithful adaptation from the original manga. Two stars cause Twin Star....just kidding. It's because the production quality of the anime isn't bad at all.",3
twin-star-exorcists,"I started watching Twin Star Exorxists on the first day it was aired. There will be some spoilers in this review. The concept of this animé an action shonen with Rokuro Enmado who although a very strong exorcism but refuses to be one and Benio Adashin from Kyoto who is considered to be one of two of the strongest exercisers for her age. They do most of their battles initially in a parallel would caled Mangano fighting beings called Kegare. Rokuro lives in Seika Dormitory near Tokyo and is walking around. Benio is riding a train to her new place of residence when her familiar, Kinako warns her that there is an Kegare  about to attack the train. She begins to fight the Kegare by using a prepared talisman that temporarily opens a gate into Mangano. She arms herself with more talismans to fight the Kegare. While trying.to fight the Kegare Benio is forced out of Mangano and starts to fall by a bridge. Rokuro is walking by the bridge and tries to catch Benio from falling. They both fall into the water of the river below. They both get out of the river and Benio uses a talisman to open another door back into Mangano bringing in Rokuro with her. Benio boasts to Rokuro that she will defeat all Kegare but she begins to run out of her spiritual energy. Rokuro seeing that Benio is a little over her head with this Kegare makes the comment if you can't make a boast without backing it up what good is it. Rokuro then starts to fight the Kegare and with the first punch purifiers the Kegare. They exit Mangano where he tries to assist Benio to where she will be moving to. While along the the way Benio who is broke and starving asks Rokuro  if she could get something to eat at a convenience store. He hands his wallet to her and she spends all of his money on all of the rice and sweet red bean cover paste called hogai which is her favorite food. Benio hands back the empty wallet Rokuro and doesn't share any of the hogai. Rokuro leaves Benio in discuss due to her rotation attitude and that of her familiar Kinako. He goes home to Seika Dormitory to his shock he finds Benio there along with Ryogo Nagitsuji, Shinnosuke Kunizaki, Atsushi Sukumozuka and the head of Seika Dormitory. They find out that they are to be forced into a prearranged marriage to give birth to the Miko the rebirth Abe no Seimei. The relationship between both Rouko and Benio is that of two tsundre characters.",5
twin-star-exorcists,"I really like the story of this anime, it shows how characters have to work together in the end, and shows exactly how weak characters can be, and the amount of effort they must put in to become stronger. I am really tired of OP characters just beating all enemies in sight quickly, and without much effort. This anime is more realistic with it, and has our two main characters trying seriously hard to become strong, and save their friends, and each other. The enemies are cool looking, and the powers are neat. Animation is great too.",5
twin-star-exorcists,"I'd say I've watched a fair amount of anime so let's assume i know what i'm talking about. Basically the story start very cliche and there are a few moments when you think ""man the character is really stupid to do that"", or that ""wow shouldn't they have learned something by now?"". Well from where i see it, its just a really really slow plot, the characters develop slower than everyone would like so if this end up being 24 there will not be any significant change unless they just scrap everything in one episode. I just see lots of potential and so far its kept my interest. Certainly not best of the season, but i would recommend watching it.",5
twin-star-exorcists,"I wanted to love this, I wanted to really really enjoy this anime. The story seems amazing but... The delivery? I can't handle the constant flashbacks upon flashbacks - to the point they'll flashback scenes from like 5 minutes prior like you'll have already forgotten. And the same emotional flashbacks over and over that don't really add much since it's what you've already seen. A few are well placed, but most? Meh.And the screaming of names the moment someone gets hurt. Like ""ILL SAVE YOU BY SCREAMING THAT IM COMING!"" it just hurts worse than any other anime of the same nature. And the RPG-esque game style of freezefame attack names, coupled with a face shot?Edit: After watching Episodes 19 and 20 I also want to add that  Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideit feels like they are shoving as many power ups, character emotional scenes, character development, and SCREAMING NAMES as they can in two episodes to rush the story along. It feels like they plan to finish the series (season?) in the next few episodes or want to get a bunch more flashbacks in!Delivery was terrible, period. The story itself? Amazing - cliche sure, but really fun! I plan to read the manga, I hear it does it more justice.",5
twin-star-exorcists,"This show really excels in the 2nd season. The first couple of episodes kinda dragged on, but what kept me coming back was the beautiful animations. Once the characters developed more the story really begins to take off. If I had to complain about anything so far it'd be that the main enemies are pretty linear even for a shounen. All in all great show, has kept me consistently coming back to it for 20 weeks.**Posted at Ep. 20",4
twin-star-exorcists,"Just as my review title states, I don't care what anyone else says about this show, I love it! Every week it leaves me pissed that I have to wait another week to see more. I haven't read the manga, and if it's like most Anime, Ill probably wait till after the anime ends, because it probably leaves a lot out, and a lot to be desired from the manga. But since I haven't read the manga, this show is killer!",4
twin-star-exorcists,"I am enjoying this thoroughly, however, I cannot see it lasting very long. It's doomed the moment they revealed that they have to have a baby. First of all they are too young to have one so theres a couple of years in the storyline but secondly I dont know how he can get anymore powerful. His arm doesnt really morph and she definitely doesnt have anything different other than the incantations she puts on each limb of her body. The other characters are kinda rubbish. They just hang in the background trying to be useful but we all know in the end that the two main characters come in to save them everytime. As for blondie I dont know how her story will pan out...fancying the main guy who doesnt fancy her back and he has to live eat and breathe with the main girl.",2
twin-star-exorcists,"The premises is seen so so many times. You have two characters who hate each other but you can see from the start that they are gonna end up together. This time the girl is the serious type and the boy comic relief. They try to be funny with these cheap jokes about adults trying to get them together and girl finding porn in boys room. Cheap... Love story is a bit forces and painful to watch. In one minute they hate each other and in another they do nice things for each other and help each other. The refrain ""I MUST GET STRONGER!"" is so so cliche! You have seen so many bad guys this far and they obviously can't defeat them yet. You have way too many things on top of another. Too many stories are being told on top of each other and non of them are moving forward...",5
twin-star-exorcists,"I initially got started on this series through the anime which it took me a bit to sit down and try to watch, but ended up being pleasantly surprised considering the lack go good anime lately. The animation and character designs are great, and voice acting is good too, no complaints there. Around episode 6 I was caught up, and wanted to know more of the plot and didn't want to wait so I went to read the manga. I spent a whole day getting caught up on the manga and it's been a bast getting to see how this story develops into a darker mature story. Now having read the manga and thoroughly enjoying the plot and characters that are later introduced, I was even more excited to see it in the anime. However, the anime makes a few slips, and takes some liberties in rearrange key story elements in the way characters first meet and so forth. These change ups in the anime series really messes up the pacing and overall story they are working towards;  it was just disappointing since the manga's  version of the story was executed so damn well. If your curious, I highly recommend reading the manga online to see what I mean. I hope that so far this change up only goes as far as Rukuro's Master, Kamui's first and second meeting with them, and how that affects the meeting with Benio's brother. I hope they stop trying to rearrange the great story the manga is far ahead on, and don't try to play it to kid friendly.....I'm getting tired of anime pulling hits at the best moments when they shouldn't.  As it stands with the current mixes and changes I'd say this is actually a 3.5 out of 5 stars, but I can't do that with the rating system. So for now I'll give it the benefit of the doubt and hope it recovers and starts to be more like the great plot the manga has, and give it 4 out of 5 stars.",5
twin-star-exorcists,"This anime led me to one of the greatest manga I have ever read. The anime has been pretty good so far, but they changed a lot of things for no reason. I don't know why studio Pierrot feels the need to change so much from the source material. They ruined Tokyo ghoul, and I hope to god they don't ruin this anime too. One of the changes they made was adding an anime original character. And this character will probably piss you off with how annoying it is. Although, this anime is slated to have more than 40+ episodes, so I will reserve my full judgement until then and hope they follow the manga more closely in future episodes. I fully recommend the manga though.",3
twin-star-exorcists,"The plot of this anime is pretty cool. It's similar in a way to Soul Eater. It's plot is something everyone has probably seen before, but that's not really a bad thing. People enjoy watching these kinds of story. I'm one of them. However, the reason I'm only giving this a 3 star rating is that this anime's story telling needs a lot of work. The story is extremely rushed and it doesn't take the time to really develop the character relationships in a way that really hooks you in and  help you relate to the characters at all. I felt like I was reading a 12 page children's story book when I was expecting more of a novel. Although I don't have much confidence in this, I hope that they're just trying to rush through setting the scene so that they can get into the meat of the story.If you've watched everything else then maybe give this a try. But if you haven't yet, there are a ton of better anime out there for you to watch.",5
twin-star-exorcists,"I read the first volume of the manga and to me the many changes they made from the original are glaring. that isn't to say this is bad. one thing I noticed they replaced the scene where Gramps and Ryogo are exorcising a young girl of a Kegare as a way to introduce the the function of Onmyoji and there reason for existance, instead they had a fight scene that explains nothing except swords and explosions. the second thing is the new characters, the cast is light on important female characters so adding one new one isn't too much trouble, but I really don't see the need for a mascot character. this is just my thoughts on the first episode so I'm refraining from giving it a harsher review. my only true concern is I can see it going the way of the soul eater anime, which is generally regared as lesser stroy wise when compared to the manga. but we'll see I have not done any divinations to know the future of this anime",5
twin-star-exorcists,"The Story of ""Twin Star Exorcists"" isn't the most original thing ever but nowadays, nothing is truly original anymore. ""Twin Star Exorcists"" provides good action scenes with nice comedy and likeable characters. That's good enough for it to be worth watching in my opinion.The animation is pretty decent too for Studio Pierrot standard.Music is great too especially the OP by the great Wagakki Band.Please give this a watch all shounen fans out there~",5
twin-star-exorcists,"I'll admit, this anime is fairly standard in what I've seen, but that's not a bad thing. I'll start with some negatives; the plot can be predictable at times, there is a section in the middle that feels repetitive but is ultimately important, the fights can be underwhelming especially regarding their finishes, the main characters at first have generic motivations and personalities. However, this show did something that other anime's have failed at- make me care. The relationship between Benio and Rokuro develops wonderfully and meant that even though it had a predicable conflict at the end and a somewhat predictable outcome for them at the end- I wanted it. The range of characters was excellent and the art style was good. I watched the dubbed version (not by choice at first but I liked it) and the voice acting was great. There's an interesting message about how the mix of bad and good in humans makes us human if you wanted to write an essay on it. I really liked both Benio and Rokuro who were both strong and flawed in their own ways. There were times where I felt that some ideas were rushed over but I was left wanting more. There are currently 50 episodes and I want more. Overall, it is an enjoyable show that is worth your time.",2
twin-star-exorcists,"I'll be honest the story was really good in the beginning, but I stopped watching it because it went off from what the main original manga was trying to produce. Everything was in line together but close to the middle of the season everything just started to change and nothing was coming out as plan like in the manga. I stopped on episode 47, because I got tired of how the story was already messed up.I just didn't like how it went off topic and change the chronological order of how everything was supposed to be introduced. Though I am going to try and finish the show. I feel that this would be better for like beginner's because some people don't really know about manga's and some do. But like most anime's don't always go with the manga and some anime's actually sound better than the manga, but for me I'm actually happy that I'm reading this manga instead of watching the anime first.Luckily, the anime had first came out after I had just started to read the manga from Anime club, when I use to be in high school the club members would read manga's before the anime's would area out.",4
twin-star-exorcists,"To be honest the characters ruined the show for me especially Rokuro and his 'in his feelings' decisions in which he tries to fight Kegare every. Every TIME. Dont get me started on Benio.. her attitude at times can be unbearable. And Kinako, whats the point of his existence in the Anime anyway?!. Overall the show was meh but The intro's and animations were quite good. But I heard the manga is quite good and is more descriptive so ill check that out. Adios",2
twin-star-exorcists,I started it thinking it wouldn't be too special just from the look of it. I could not have been more mistaken I ended up finishing the anime in two days it is 100% worth a watch! I have watched over 225 other anime and rarely come across ones that I will sit and binge anymore but this brought me back to when I was first starting with anime and just wanted to know what every anime would end with. This is one of the best anime I have watched in a long time,4
twin-star-exorcists,Please bring this back I fell in love with this and want to sea more so I will stay tune if there is a twin star exorcists 2 so please make more...………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..                                                                                                           Ps: if you need more people to act I got u lol,4
twin-star-exorcists,"to make it clear I liked the show, I thought it was great but I can see why people would want to give it the lowest possible score in the  history of mankind and its understandable why. to sum this up in a nut shell this story blanketed in clichés and a near translucent plot aside from the two well placed twist at the end. this show is for people who like the shonen battle show where love prevails all and has a happy ending and people who don't like that will without hesitation move one to their preferred category. and thats fine it wasn't for you in the first place but they go one to leave a ill written review, its like having the worlds best musicison judge the work of the worlds best artist it jest doesn't resonate well. watch this show if you like Naruto but don't expect it to be anywhere as good I jest got that kind of vide watching. its got some good art work and I'm not certain if it was the third or fourth opening song but it was one of the best that I've heard in a while and the characters and plot are predictable but likable and its a happy ending, its not a angle beats or Naruto nor fate/stay but its still entertaining for the target audience but it sadly gets trashed buy people who haven't even gotten past episode 5 out of 50. I hope this clarified some things if any and gave merit to my star rating.",5
twin-star-exorcists,"The impurities of Magano do not rest, creatures that can be described as hellish and demonic who invade our world on a whim, threatening our way of life as long as humanities exorcists could remember. Rokuro Enmadou, a used to be exorcist in training, has given it all up over a traumatic past and now lives in Tokyo. Benio Adashino, a growing prodigy within the realm of exorcism has been summoned to the area. The meeting of the two signals the reincarnation of the one true exorcist that will cleanse all the impurities of the world, bringing peace and order at last. Rokuro and Benio will be the ones to bring that peace, as the twin star exorcists, who in time will give birth to this one true exorcist as prophesied, the Miko.As said in the title, Twin Star Exorcists was one of the first anime, (3rd anime I watched to be exact) it got me hooked into the unpredictable unique world of anime itself. Before I go into detail about the show, I'm going to say that I won't. Despite a great first half of the anime, the second half of the show just was slowly going down and down, a new story that wasn't taken from the manga, with weak writing and losing focus of what made it good in the first place. So while this is an anime review, I'm going to instead recommend the manga. Of which I decided to pick up not long ago, and re-sparked the once devoted love I had for this series. If you absolutely want to see the anime though, just don't expect things to stay good after the halfway point, play it safe and lower some expectations, since the story after that point is not a true adaptation of the manga, and just feels thrown together for the sake of continuing the anime.",4
twin-star-exorcists,"At first, I loved it. Sure, it was cliché but they manage to make it work. I'd been hearing a lot about it, so I watched the anime first and immediately binged the first 5 or so episodes. Even without reading the source material, it was painfully obvious which parts were filler. This anime really is a classic example of a bad adaptation. Whether it was the lack of people in the background or the unnecessary scenes put in to make the main characters look cooler, it made my love for the show waver quite a bit. At some points, it was as if the main characters were in a ghost town- no police, no bystanders, not even any parents concerned for their children. The way the fillers were done seemed to be in order to pad out the story and make is as long as possible, and they wanted to do so in the quickest way possible (not even one bystander off in the distance?)After hearing that the manga was better, I decided to give it a try. Thank goodness I did, since it has everything I loved about the first few episodes and more. I was surprised that the mascot character wasn't there at first, but I thought back to the anime and realized that he never really added too much to the story and was probably an easy add-on. I realized after reading it that the anime could only ever be action-adventure or some sort of rom-com school adventure. What made it work in the manga was the combination of both, but I found that the anime was either one or the other.Since this review is about the anime, I will say that the animation is nice as well as the character designs and voice-acting. If I had remained ignorant and not read the manga my opinion of this may have been higher. The fight scenes are well done which is what made me so confused when some scenes seemed to have not a lot of effort put in (and I don't mean sloppy artwork, I mean things like timing of the fillers and consideration as to whether it seems like it would happen in this universe.)If you really want to give it a try, I'd at most only recommend the first few episodes since the story then goes off-track, and while I've learned that that can be a good thing, this unfortunately was not the case.",4
twin-star-exorcists,"The beginning is promising, but majority of the rest of the show feels repetitive and cliche, besides parts leading up to the ending. 50 episode is too much for a story that could have been told in half the time. This a somewhat unique take, but still a very cliche shounen rom-com. I feel like some episodes could have been cut out or several could have been condensed into 1-2 episodes instead of taking of multiple. The plot was somewhat original, but towards the end I began to see similarities to other anime. The power scaling in the show, seems to cater to the plot whenever it pleases, which can throw the viewer off. Not to mention the fight scenes can be somewhat annoying and repetitive with the calling out of each move along with text, followed by a battle cry(happens way too often.)The characters are likable, but can be very annoying at times with their interactions. Some of the plot twist can be easily predicted with a little thought and can be found in other well known anime. If you like rom-coms with some action, then this anime might be for you, but 50 episodes might be a bit much if you prefer story over romance & comedy. I found this painful to watch half way through, but continued anyway, because I hate not finishing a show.I wanted to enjoy this show, but by the end I couldn't be any more happier that it was finally over. After watching so much anime, this one just felt way too predictable towards the end, even at times during the middle of the show. The romance was very cliche and annoying at times. The action, besides the complaint about announcing every move every single time was ok. The visuals at times were amazing and sometimes they were the opposite. The entire anime was cliche, but if it was executed better I might have been able to enjoy it more. I got some laughs here and there, but overall this anime was a bust for me. I feel like this show would have been much better with 25-30 episodes as majority of it felt pointless and painful to sit through. If you are new to anime, you might enjoy this, but if you are a experienced anime viewer and have watched more than just shonen anime, I will definitely not recommend this to you.",1
twin-star-exorcists,"Twin Star Exorcists has a lot of potential with a hero with a bitter past and a netherworld full of evil spirits. However, it's emphasis on a forced romance feels... forced. With a typical tsundere gag, a lot of episodes are wasted trying to make sparks fly. The comedic relief is also lacking and the jokes aren't unique enough to be refreshing. It does have some badass moments and some badass characters, but the plot as a whole lacks cohesivity and isn't compelling enough to wait for the story to progress.The manga does a much better job than the anime in progressing the story so if you're really interested in the story I would go ahead and read the manga instead. The anime isn't a bad show to play in the background though.",5
twin-star-exorcists,"This anime is really good in my opinion, and i really like how they finally showed us some real connection between Rokuro and Benio. I like the pace at which the story moves and i like how all the characters are some what developed and have a reason too be in the story. The reason why i didnt give it 5 stars is because i do think there are some things they can improve upon but never the less still a good anime",5
twin-star-exorcists,"This one I’ll keep brief. What I liked about this show is it’s co ed, not to a Bleach degree but more so than Naruto. I liked the bonding between Benio and Rokuro, how they had to work hard to understand each other and ultimately work together. I even liked the idea of their arranged marriage. I liked the character designs (more on that in a minute) and most of the character interactions. I liked the action scenes to a point (more on that later). This show worked…For about 20 episodes. Then they introduce the 12 most powerful exorcists alive today, without giving any reason or explanation of how this kegare problem persists if they’re that damn powerful. And if Rokuro and Benio are more powerful than them, why are they needed? Their character designs are suppose to reflect their uniqueness, but part of the appeal of this show in the beginning was the simplicity of the standard exorcist uniform, and the fact they had the same set of skills. Then they travel to Kyoto to battle basara, but they struggle against some, easily defeat others, and simply can’t/don’t defeat others. Then the final arc comes where once again we have a villain so over powered the writers had to have him choose to not simply kill the heroes because then it’s game over. Also the plot twist at the end is so clichéd and predictable I can’t honestly recommend this show. One thing I do want to mention is this apparently isn’t based on a game, video or otherwise. The star logo upon death of kegare and the screen caps of the techniques used got old fast and annoying; I’d rather they yell them out (which they did too). A bonus point for ""Re:Call"" by i☆Ris.",4
twin-star-exorcists,"The color palette is nice.... After 7 episodes, its really slow, and the characters are dull. We're told (several times) how worthless the Rokuro (the male lead is), but that never really comes across. Considering the amount of time they waste in exposition and flashbacks, they definitely could have put in some more 'slice of life' elements to help the viewer actually understand Rokuro's basic worthlessness and tragic past (which we are teased with incessantly but still know nothing about, which I'm expecting to be disappointingly simple at this point). Maybe its a 'slow burn' type of thing, but if you only have enough emotion to put into one episode, it probably shouldn't be spread out over six. The fantasy elements are neat and could be interesting (and maybe are later) but at least at the beginning we're treated to the same moves and spells over and over, and expected to be amazed each time. The danger to the characters hasn't so far ever been actually convincing in the least, and the same plot element keeps getting fed to us over and over again (""seems like the kegare attacks are getting worse!"") without any actual progression with them.  They could honestly get away with that if there were actually a little more depth to the characters.(aside: The 'evil laughter' of the kegare (interdimensional Demon things, which I don't think is explained ever as it is in the manga...though I did doze off a couple times so maybe I missed it) is reminiscent of Puella Magi Madoka Magica, which also is a constant reminder of how this show isn't as good as that one (not that it should be, but doesn't help the cause).)If it were between watching more Black Clover or this, I would definitely choose this, and as much as some people have hyped it, maybe it does get better over time. It is visually okay to look at, but, just like the characters, it always feels like they're dragging their feet on its potential, and maybe don't even care if they're going to get there. Two stars for potential and for not being Nobunagun.",3
twin-star-exorcists,"I've watched whole in mare 2 days. And I loved it. Series starting late, about 8/9th episode but at first you laugh and enjoy the fight then you love it and watch fight then you realise that you fall in love with main characters when you were laughing at them.And finally you are sad. Topic covering main characters were almost like forgotten and you just want more about them and less about fights.... but it ended.... and now you've got void in your heart.... and just want season 2.... sadness.... ;<",2
twin-star-exorcists,"At first, I mostly got attached to this because of the neat, other-worldly stuff that was going on. The interested exorcisms and powers. The backstory of Roku that I absolutely needed to know.But then the plot decided to smack me in the face, and just keep getting deeper and pulling me in further.Needless to say, it got REAL interesting and REAL good, kind of all at once, and then it never stopped getting good. Haha! The character development is insane, and the details and backstory just keep getting better. Towards the end when things start coming together it did keep me on edge. Watching this simulcasted was almost self-torture, honestly.Not to mention some of the openings. The openings. ARE SO GOOD.If you like action/fantasy/lil romancin on the side. Definitely pointing at this one here, it's pretty dang good actually.",5
twin-star-exorcists,"There are a lot of reviews for this show so I'll just say a few things here.  I'm 32 episodes in at this point in the series and I have seen our main characters grow up from kids to young teens. Not many animes do this (actually, hardly any anime does this) so it was refreshing for me to watch them grow up into mature young adults.  I do find the shikigame annoying but that's a staple of most anime I watch; in other words, I'm not going to decrease a show's rating just because it has an annoying character in it.  If you want proof...well, just think about the anime shows you have watched in your life...trust me, you'd need several hands to count the annoying characters you've had to endure.  Anyway, the relationship between Rokuro and Benio is adorable and not over the top with the romance.  I particularly enjoy Arima's tenacious trolling about the awkward affair.  It is hilarious.  Rokuro, as a kid, is pretty annoying but I still believed Rokuro would act that way...I mean, he is a kid with a grandiose dream after all.  The show also doesn't hold back on the damage the two MC's face throughout the series.  Let's just say people are gonna lose stuff...important stuff...Lastly, the action sequences are good.  The fights with the basara have a weight to them.  I am confused about one basara that likes to play heavy metal music.  It's weird, but fortunately, I like heavy metal music.If you are new to the series, give it a couple of episodes.  I believe it's worth it.",4
twin-star-exorcists,"I will start off by saying due to some early on power level imbalance which has become way to common, plus some what I thought at the time to be Bleach like similarities it was hard to see it for its own thing. However as I watched more and more into the series I did realize this show was quite good in its own right. This show overall is a fun anime with a  good  fighting game like aesthetic to the fight scenes they do these ultimate moves and the attack name plasters across the screen followed by a picture of the face of the person doing it screaming their head off, but somehow this never got old for me. this show has good pacing for the most part, but it does make some really bad choices at some points when this are grim exciting then something happens that kill all tension flat out; luckily this only happens one or two times. now that I put in my biggest gripes and likes I will put a pros and cons list for sake of simplicity Pros: in no particular order1. Great main characters with good believable development between them2. Fight scenes are enjoyable.3. Most of the the villains are complex enough to be sympathetic, but not so much that they become confusing.  4. The plot is good and doesn't try to be FF7 in levels of complexity, so I can watch once and get the plot after thinking about it for a while.5. I didn't once consider quitting part way through. A lot of great anime can have this issue where you say to yourself well I can give it two more episodes then I'm done. I never had that moment with this.  Cons: from biggest deal to smallest 1. The bulk of the supporting cast is under developed for the amount of screen time they get.2. the final boss.3. The one or two pacing killer scenes.4. The power level jumps, but these are nowhere near the level of say Bleach. Then once it happens it stays pretty consistent there after, so not to big of a gripe here.  That's my lot  hope it made sense.",4
twin-star-exorcists,"its litterally the standard shonen formula anime, it feels so corporate and predictable, all, litterally all of the characters are just archeatypes like the cold loving one, the standard brown-haired portagonist and tsundere girl. most of the characters are so edgy their where times i thought this was ripped off of deviant art. The animal is terribly annoying and it just served as another standard part of the shonen formula as the animal companion. the only, only thing i can say is different and unique about this show is it is a romance, both protagonists have a very strong bond and thats the only thing worth watching for, if you can stand the filler. which is 90% of the show anyway because they wanted to maximize profits by making this anime longer. they only ever kiss and confess at the very end, litterally the last couple minutes. thats all the true romance you get, the rest is half romance stalling just because its corporate and simply sticks to a formula, you can tell how thin theyve worn the story by the end, and i could litterally not stand to watch 18 minutes of filler and the characters doing nothing except talking, with the other 2 minutes consisting of half romance and the worst least hyped poorly made fight scenes, you can tell they where made by workers being enslaved by a corporation and forced to make mildly interesting fighting animation as fast as possible. it all feels very predictable and unbearable at times, standard cookie cutter anime.",4
twin-star-exorcists,"This anime is a typical shounen onmyouji stoyline, good vs evil, love and hate, all the things that typically represent this genre. That said I thoroughly enjoyed the story. While in the beginning, I was not a huge fan of either Benio or Rokuro, the characters grow on you as watch them grow, live, and mature. I enjoy new innovative anime, manga, and light novels as much as the next guy, but shows like this remind me why people love these cliched and stereotypical plots. I definitely recommend this series!",4
twin-star-exorcists,"wanted to give it 4 stars , but kinda can't . not to say it was bad , but like some other reviews , nothing new here , nothing ground breaking. Just a standard anime tale given enough episodes to develop the characters solidly. Kinda reminds me of Eureka Seven , but I enjoyed E7 a lot more , maybe because like another reviewer stated , I've seen this story before and would be great for new anime watchers but YMMV for those who have been around for awhile.",5
twin-star-exorcists,"On its own, it's a decent quality anime, not the best and not the worst. When you bring the manga into perspective the anime has much to live up to. Frankly, as most people are excited to find a new anime for their beloved manga this anime was a disappointment. There were very few situations that lined up with the manga and I would not recommend it if you have already read the manga. The manga has great quality artwork that makes someone want to reread it twice and plot in depth that the anime did  not live up to instead deciding that halfway through the anime they were going to complete change the plot while attempting to include major scenarios in different situations. Also, the art was weak and required more effort to be on par with the manga. There were some episodes I did enjoy such as the anime has one or two episodes that focus on the Shimon X Mayura ship, but the manga quickly followed up with subtle but sweet situations.The anime has much to yearn for if it is ever going to strive to catch up to the manga's quality.",5
twin-star-exorcists,"Pretty simple here. The shows concept, art and everything is great except implementation. The show can build some real hype but it never really seemed to deliver on it for me. It was slow, but doesn't really have a lot of character development to compensate. The fights are cool but you never really get a good struggle, just flip flops from ""we can't even hurt him,"" to ""we just one shot him."" You never really get the sense that they grew. I just couldn't get into it and I really wanted to.",3
twin-star-exorcists,"The story was alright for a shounen for most of the series.  Thinly veiled excuses to fight monsters and some poorly written angsty teen drama about a couple being forced to work and live together even though they hated each other.  It even did a decent job showing why they eventually fall in love.  What it failed was it's landing.  The ending is atrocious with deus ex machina and old irrelevant characters coming out of the woodwork in droves.  The McGuffins were way to convenient and nothing explained why anyone should care about what was happening at all.  As vested as I became with the characters, it was easily shattered when the story itself stopped caring.  A huge waste of time.",4
twin-star-exorcists,"So let's get something clear first off. Like many anime adaptions, they diverge quite a bit, this is a really good anime, but very lacking compared to the manga.With that out of the way, we can continue with the review. So, when we talk about shounen anime, this one falls into many typical stereotypes. Overall, I give the plot a 10/10, presentation 8/10, character depth 9/10, progression of story 5/10. This is one really good anime when it comes to plot/story, and character depth. Mostly it's presented in a light-hearted and funny way, but has some very dark times in the character developments. Most of the characters are lovable and mostly work together to improve among themselves, some in harsh ways, others openly competitive. If you watch the anime, just know that it can be frustrating at times to follow the developments, they will throw juicy morsels at you one episode, and then not follow it up til several episodes later. The romance aspect between the characters can be described as typical for a shounen story, but it doesn't end like most. Wouldn't want to spoil anything for you guys/gals. Action sequences are decent, but they never stop showing a bold type Japanese name of the spell's freeze frame, even for common spells that are used often which is why I say decent, or the action would be amazing. I hope this review helps and if you do watch it, I bet it'll be a new favorite for you guys too. I've been watching anime since the mid 1990's and this is in easily my top 10 now.",5
twin-star-exorcists,I'm reading the manga and when I found out about the anime I thought I'd give it a shot. At first Rokuro reminded me of Naruto with him being so loud and obnoxious but he grows up and is slightly calmer. Benio was the strong exterior/fragile mind complex going which was a good refresher since she came like that straight from the beginning. It was slow at times then at the end it felt rushed for the characters to get stronger which technically they didn't. All in all that anime is a good binge worthy show to keep you occupied. I hope in the future they will do this anime following the manga like how there was FMA and then later FMA:Brotherhood because the characters grow so much more and work so much harder. It would be nice to see that on screen.,5
twin-star-exorcists,"*Possible Spoilers Ahead*Twin Star Exorcists is the epitome of your generic action/adventure shounen, stuffed full with every cliché in the book. Brooding protagonist with a  dark past? Check. Said protagonist wants to be the strongest [insert title]? Check. Constant flashbacks, ridiculously named magic/attacks/special moves, and yelling someone's name 50 times in an episode? Check, check, aaaand check. Seriously, it's all there. I partially expected this going in, and yet I will admit that I had an inkling of interest in the show. Throughout the first arc (episodes 1-20) the show held mild enjoyment for me; nothing exceptional, and it definitely had problems, but it had just enough intrigue and potential to make me click to the next episode. And then I keep watching, and oh boy was I in for a disappointment. TSE, in its race to rise above mediocrity, firmly face-plants into just-plain-bad for the remainder of it's 50-episode run, kicking up more glaring flaws than the MC can yell ""YUTOOOOO."" Plot/character threads left hanging, one-dimensional characters, inconsistent pacing, and deus ex machina galore (seriously, this show would have been so much shorter if the main cast wasn't constantly saved by inexplicable occurrences.) My biggest complaint though, is the sheer amount of forced emotion it tries to push onto the viewer; e.g. ""Look, these characters are all crying, that means you need to be sad too!"" It spends so much time reminding you to be sad, or angry, or happy for the young couple, that it itself completely forgets to give you a  reason to feel these emotions. ""No, I'm not sad that this character 'died,' you never gave me a reason to care."" ""No, I don't care about the MC's romance, you never put effort in to make it believable."" It was frankly embarrassing how often the plot would be sidelined so we can hear about what they're 'feeling' for several minutes. /rantOn the more technical side, the animation varies from average to sub-par, with re-used sequences during fights a very common occurrence. Music was okay; not bad, but largely forgettable. Not really much else to say, nothing exceptional to see here. tl;drFor a show running a full 50 episodes, it's quite simply just not worth the time investment. A wholly generic shounen that starts off 'okay,' but quickly devolves into a tedious slog that buries any small sparks of originality or entertainment that might still be there. Honestly, if the show had ended after the first arc, or was condensed into a 24-ish episode run, I might feel differently, but as it stands this is not a show I would recommend to any self-respecting anime fan.",5
knights-magic,"I'm someone who reads the novel so I came into this show with bias. They skipped a lot of content, content that they could have easily made 3 episodes of and most of those content should have been damn good. Instead they rushed it so they can show off their precious toys. When I read the novel, it wasn't the mechs that enticed me, it was Ernesti's relationship with the people around him. Here it's obvious that they're putting mechs as the centerpiece. Because of how rushed it feels, it's hard to care about characters other than Ernesti. That said if you love mechs and magic, you might like this work, i'd still give it a go despite my first impressions.",4
knights-magic,"This is quite original as it is unoriginal. What I mean is, this anime has taken basic scenario events for your stereotypical anime, and given it a kick boost.It's nothing very new, your basic main character fiasco with robots beating the living heck outta each other, but at the same time it's playing with a different idea.The first episode show the main character being good at something, dying and being reborn into another world with magic and robots while keeping his memories through his sheer desire and love for robots. Him and his friend's (sheer speculation at this point as only at the first episode) save the world and/or change it hugely.Though it is still very interesting as for some of it's own original pieces and how the story seems to be playing through. I very much so recommend this, and I cannot wait for the next episode",3
knights-magic,"The first episode looked great to me, and it continues to keep my attention through the season.  There are points where it seems to be a little rushed, or could use more background details, but that is easy to look past.  This is an interesting combination of 2 ideas, where you take a person to be reborn into another world with magically driven mechas.  Naturally it helps a great deal that he is a genius and retains both his memories and obsession with mechas, but getting stuck in a child's body come with it's own limitations.  Add support of friends, and being born into the right family, and you have the beginnings of a great possibilities.A genius programmer mecha otaku has his life cut short by a car accident, and is filled with great regret over the models he will never get to build.  Finding himself reborn into another world of magic, mecha, and giant monsters he is instantly fascinated when his father saves him from an attack in his knight frame.  Combining genius and obsession with the goal of becoming a knight himself, we see the first episode fill in the growth required to start his path to greatness along with a new threat to the kingdom itself.  The growth and progress he shows are astounding, but not without setbacks.  His eternal optimism is contagious as he chases not only his dreams of an ideal mech of his own creation, but also preservation of the safety of his friends and kingdom.",4
knights-magic,"I am a big fan of the manga and light novel so it is no surprise that I have found a new love in the anime adaption. While the plot may feel 'rushed' considering they compressed  a number of chapters from the manga/novel into one episode, that is by no means a downside. While the build up does not hold the same impact if you have read the manga or novel, the visuals and music definitely make up for it in spades.Speaking of making up for things, the first episode is definitely how you are SUPPOSED to introduce a new anime adaption, especially for those who are not familiar with the original material. Knight's & Magic is your typical 'present day individual transported to a world of high-fantasy' setting, however it implements giant robots/mecha which offers an interesting twist on the genre. If you are a fan of fantasy/magic and giant robots, Knight's & Magic is right up your alley. The only reason this anime falls short of five stars is because of how fast they introduced most of the plot and characters in a single episode. This is just personal preference due to the fact I have read the manga and novel, but does not take away in any fashion from the overall show. I look forward to seeing how they introduce the rest of the story and I can safely say that it is off to a good start. As this is the first episode, this review will be updated as more episodes are released.",5
knights-magic,"Holy  BALLS, I love the magical mecha in this series. Let me get that out of the way first. If you want some mecha eyecandy, then look no further, for this series crammed with ornate designs and tiny bits genuinely interesting speculative magic-science regarding how they work.The elevator pitch for Knight's & Magic is fantastic: ""Gifted programmer, and cog in a large corporate machine is transported to a world of magical mecha, huge monsters, and geopolitical intrigue where his knowledge could change the balance of power.""Unfortunately the execution turns out to be ""Fearless super genius, and cheerful sociopath Mary Sue character effortlessly wins at everything."" There is actually a good story and interesting world hiding behind that hideously cloying facade, but you'll only ever catch glimpses of concepts that could have made an excellent and original series.Still... I made it through the first 10 episodes and keep coming back for more, so I guess it can't be that terrible? The story beats are generally good... it's just that the telling of them is abysmal.",4
knights-magic,"So I started watching Anime in 1998. I remember when a good season meant :  One Piece, Naruto, Bleach, Code Geass, Death Note, Nana, Welcome to the NHK, Honey and CLover, Higarushi and Haruhi, Black Lagoon insert 100s better shows here.  I am a deeply cynical/pessimist about the state of Anime today. In My disappointment this  this the current state  and this is probably the most interesting anime i have seen on crunchy roll this season.This  series starts like Tanya Evil, the main character is Onada from Yowa Peda except he is 30 and a genius programmer. He gets hit by a car while buying is mecha toys and dies. He regrets all the gundam models he wont get obuild today, and in the future.  He is reincarnated with his memories to the Kingdom of Vision Escaflowne where he realizes he can live his dream of building magical girl robots.Okay t his isn't exactly accurate.  The story is a born again in a new-world  (opposed to be thrown into a new world)   with some twist. The guy reincarnated wits a a genius programmer and hard core gundam otaku. He dies in a car accident and wounds up reincarnated as a boy in a Kingdom where they use mechs equipped/powered with RPG magic to fight demons. Luckily his family is heavily invested in training mech pilots   which gives him a chance to achieve his life long dream of building his own unique Grandam.",2
knights-magic,"This anime is as an excuse to show off great looking and very intricate mechas. The story just seems to be an after thought. Nothing bad ever seems to happen to the main characters. Anytime they're faced with a challenge, they always effortlessly overcome it. It's worth watching if you love mecha's and don't care about a dry story. I certainly enjoyed it for that aspect, but the lack of a good story is why I subtracted two stars.",5
knights-magic,"CRUISE CONTROL IS ONDO YOU LIKE GUNDAMS?DO YOU LIKE MAGIC?DO YOU LIKE MONSTERS GETTING PWNED?HAVE YOU EVER WANTED TO WATCH GUNDAMS BEAT THE CRAP OUT OF MONSTERS?LET ME TELL YOU THIS IS THE ANIME FOR YOU!The series so far is everything I could've hoped for in an anime. They utilize time skips in a proper and well thought out manner. The pacing is somewhat fast but its really good so far. The artstyle, and music is awesome! The monsters are unique and interesting so far, and the main character has a unique spin. I love Gundam, and I love Magic, this show brought them both together and has literally made my 2017.ConsSide characters lack depth, feels bad man some are pretty interesting but you wont get much out of them.  (7 episodes in maybe it will change)There's a hell of alot more to the story you're missing. There's a lot of side story and other things going on that would be really cool to see in the show. It has an episode limit (im hoping for 50 but probably 25, if its 12 I am cry)",3
knights-magic,"After watching many different types of anime, this is like a breath of fresh air.The anime is face paced and fun, as of  writing this review we are currently 7 episodes in and they have been a great 7 episodes so far!I love Eru's love for mechs and how he is able to control magic as he would programming.The character development is a little slow but great none the less.The animation is great and the overall story is pretty awesome!I look forward to watching this show every week!",5
knights-magic,"I only got through five episodes because I just couldn't shake the feeling that nothing really matters in this world. It isn't super emotionally deep, which leads me to believe that I am supposed to enjoy this for the fun value. And a world where magic, mechas, and monsters exist definitely seems like a lot of fun. I didn't really have any fun though. I feel like the world is just shallow, and only the main character gives anything meaning. I'm all for a good power fantasy, but it is just like his achievements don't mean anything at all. The writers are definitely trying to convince me they are important through characters reacting with surprise, or talking about how unprecedented an accomplishment like this is, but we really aren't made to care about the results. Like, we don't really know any of the characters, the kingdom, even the main character has little personality beyond, ""I like robots"". Maybe if the robots and action scenes were great it would be fun on that level, but all the fights are pretty forgettable due to looking like every other mecha fight with no redeeming story components.If you really like Mecha and Fantasy, you might like this anime in spite of its flaws. The magic/tech systems are genuinely interesting but don't go in expecting much.",5
knights-magic,"K&M's biggest sin is it makes me miss the series that use each part of it better.Reincarnation into a magical world: K&M could have done without it entirely, just letting Ernesti be a robot-loving genius. Done better in Tanya the Evil.Mecha in magical setting: K&M has them on such a high powerscale that nations don't field anyone not in a mecha. That's before Ernesti sets off DBZ-level power level increases. Done better in Escaflowne (series). Main character as center of female attention: Several eps in and only 2 waifus, neither really in it to win it. Done better in *list too extensive.*",2
knights-magic,"Bolded text is tl;drThis anime is about magic and mechas, but it is also about engineering. The show stars Ernesti, a student at an academy that trains Silhouette Knights(mecha pilots). Ernesti himself is a coder reincarnated into this world. What I love most about the series is not the mecha fights (which are fun), or the magic (which I desperately wish I could know more about), but the sheer earnestness and joy of Ernesti and his team designing, iterating, and testing their new toys. Ernesti is more an engineer than a fighter (though he kicks butt), and as of Ep. 4 that has been the focus of the series. That said character development is not good so far, I couldn't tell you much about any of the characters besides Ernesti, and he lacks depth too. Also Exposition Lady, in which a Morgan Freeman style voiceover tells what just happened or explains some aspect of the world, is mildly infuriating if you already dislike exposition dumps. Luckily outside of the 1st episode she pops in quickly and mostly serves in a slightly less annoying capacity as a narrator. All that said, I love it. Ernesti's love of robots is infectious, it has enough action and plot to hold your attention, the magic is cool, the mechas and fight scenes are well done, and it's genuinely fun to watch. If you dislike Ernesti by the end of Ep. 2 you can can probably pass over this one, as he's definitely the main draw of the series.So why did I write this long review? Because it's my hobby. 8/10 would rebalance power/mana ratios again.",4
knights-magic,"I'm going to echo what a lot of other folks have been saying here: this anime is lacking in character development but overall isn't bad. The MC is adorable in his reincarnation. Visuals are pretty, and the building your own mecha concept is decent. The problem is that I'm not really invested. I'm not sure I care what happens to any of the characters.There's also not much world-building here. I have no idea what the monsters are and why they attack humans. I don't have much of an idea about the society, except that it's some sort of kingdom ruled by a king. I don't know much about the magic that powers the robots except that there is magic.Basically, it's fluffy cute so far, without any real depth. All that said, pickings are a little slim this season, so I'll probably keep watching.",4
knights-magic,"I love anime like this, it has a sort of clichéd but amusing concept. I found myself laughing in the first episode already, if you don't mind somewhat clichéd stories then this is for you trust me when I say it kinda grabs you. I cant wait for the next episodes. I like the fact he keeps his memories and can understand tech from the world he was in still! this show has a great potential!Edit1: episode 2 is drawing me in, its been awhile since ive seen this kind of story. its taking something so generic and making it into something so profoundly enjoyable and interesting, I haven't seen something this enjoyable in years. please let this be a 25 episode season and have 5 seasons, for the love of god this is good! I love the fact that he isn't to op either, he is susceptible to mana drain like everyone else in the story, just taking his old selves programming skills and using them on mechs gives him a massive advantage,. I like where this is going",3
knights-magic,"Honestly, when I first saw this anime, I thought, ""Wow! A reincarnation fantasy anime! Just want I needed."" Although, when I started watching it, I noticed most of the entire anime was just... a person making a robot with stuff half the audience have no idea what are. I think it really depends on if this is the kind of anime for you. But if you expecting a fun really overpowered character like in ""Wise Man's Grandchild,"" this isn't the kind of anime for you.   Also, they almost NEVER talk about the main character's reincarnation. If you are going to not talk about the mc dying and being reincarnated at all pretty much, what is the point of them getting reincarnated in the first place...? To make robots in this world more understandable? I really don't think you need that to make the robots understandable, it is a fantasy world, the audience would somewhat expect it.",5
knights-magic,"This anime is something of a guilty pleasure for me. I hate it when there is tension, or conflict, or anything that makes me feel uncomfortable in a show or movie. I know. I have the tastes of a child. That's what I mean when I say it's too easy to watch. The protagonist is a genius engineer, tactician, and fighter. He faces hardly any setbacks, which means there's no character development. He's almost like Rick in Rick & Morty, except this is a mecha anime, not a nihilistic, sci-fi cartoon. The most character development we see is in Kid, Dietrich, and the princess.The plot itself is not terrible but I think it is fundamentally flawed in that there is no definitive end. What is our protagonist's goal? To make robots? He's already done that, so where does it end? The only hint at an overarching story we've had is when the elf queen referred to Ernie as the chosen one or something along those lines.What the show does have going for it is good animation, fight sequences, and pacing. The 3-D animation doesn't stick out like a sore thumb (cough cough Netiflix cough), and the action sequences are complex and exciting. The pacing is almost too fast, but that is much preferred to being drawn out. The show liberally uses time lapses which is completely fine by me. The result is two completed arcs in 13 episodes.",3
knights-magic,"First, let's immediately point the elephant in the room. This anime is bound to be incomplete and to feel as lacking due to 2 important points :1) It's based on a Light Novel that isn't completed yet.2) It's skipping half of the content from the Light Novel, meaning some character are barely developed in the anime while they are really well described and constructed in the Light Novel.From this point, I would say the Manga is a LOT more better at explaining and showing the story from the Light Novel's content.Due to this, the story, design and characters will feel cheap and simple. It makes the series suffers from some really bad case of time skipping. (Think of it as if each episode of 20 minutes covers 2-3 months of in-story content.) At best, you could consider this anime as a summary of the Light Novel.Still, the visual quality and sounds are really good and, if considering it alone, it's still fun to watch. If I could, I would give it a 3.5/5, but I wouldn't give it 4/5, hence the 3 stars. If you start watching this, don't think you'll have a quality story like Escaflowne or Code Geass. The visual is on par, but not the adapted script.",5
knights-magic,"It's cheesy the Main Character is a Marty Stu who looks like Mary. It's glorious while attempting to follow the Mech, D&D, MC reborn in a new reality after dying in Modern Day Tokyo, and harem troupes. The art direction, and timing make the show 100% fresh while making sure to hit every predictable troupe ever. It deserves it's 5 star ratings, not only for being fun, and entertaining, but this one will be a fan favorite for years.p.s. if you want 100% original content. This one technically fails, while being brilliant in it's originality.p.s.2. Oh and if you enjoy this, read the Light Novel it's based on. It's even better.",4
knights-magic,"I have been a fan of the Mecha genre of anime for some time. I have to say this anime presents it in an interesting light by using the transported to another world trope after death and the mechanical side is interesting and I have enjoyed the action sequences and the idea that magic is based on a programming language.However having read the light novel and the manga I feel like they have skipped several major plot points and in some areas, it feels rushed.Overall I think it is generally a good anime.",2
knights-magic,"Too often I feel people give things bad reviews because something isn't original. People say this has been done before or the concept is the same. I personally don't think there is anything wrong with that. I mean at this point in time everything was inspired by something else right. Overall I would give it a solid 4 simply because its still in its infancy. Before the end though I imagine it be be an 5 or beyond That being said I think this mecha anime is awesome. Essentially transferring one person's mind to a different world, but having lost none of his genius. So far its only a few episodes in, but I think this show has so much potential. The very idea behind that concept of creating new new units, you can go anywhere from there. Combine other ideas from other mech shows. I think this show is only limited by the creators imagination. Just like in the show, if you can dream it you can make it. Only episode 6 was just released, but this could be a top notch show.",5
knights-magic,"The premise combines several otherwise cliche elements into something unique; a genius programmer is reincarnated into a world where magic is ""programmed"" and can power giant mechs.  All have been done before, but this show intelligently combines them into something that's instantly engaging.  Personally, I love the fact that it spends so much time on building the mechs, offering a glimpse of some deep world-building.The animation and art are mostly fantastic.  The fight scenes are very well done.  The mechs and the monsters are highly detailed.  The main characters look pretty good, but you can tell a side character just by the lower quality.  In a show where the Mechs are clearly the focus, the good definitely far outweighs the bad.Three episodes in, the plot is still coming into focus.  It starts innocent, man vs monster, but there are hints of something darker on the horizon.  Creating stronger weapons will help the humans (and dwarfs) stand against the monsters, but what happens when they're turned against their creators?  Other reviews point out that the anime skips through a more detailed set-up available through the manga, but focusing purely on the show, it does a very acceptable job of introducing the world and putting the plot into motion.  It is also worth pointing out that there are a few bits of narrated exposition that are a bit jarring next to how engaging the rest of the show is.  Once again, the good far outweighs the bad and I'm very eager to see how it develops!On the weaker side of things, the characters are so far a little simplistic.  The only character that really stands out is the main character, in good and bad ways.  Ernesti is a little too capable, ""good"", and has no backstory worth mentioning.  However, accepting the original premise, his enthusiasm carries the scenes of dialogue.  As the darker elements of the plot come into focus, we'll hopefully be introduced to some villains and to more grey areas of the current characters.Strengths:-Fantastic premise and world, taking a handful of otherwise cliche elements and creating something interesting-Great looking mechs, monster(s), and action scenes-Three episodes in, interesting hints of a deeper plot and intrigue-A mecha fan's dream medieval fantasy world-Very little fan-service (knock on wood)Cons:-Character animation simplistic compared to the mechs and monsters-Characters are weak, so far",4
knights-magic,"Its funny, I didnt read any other reviews, and I was also going to say character development felt rushed. However:This protagonist is a damn fine character. He is just FUN. His genuine enthusiasm comes across very well and you can feel how he connects to the people around him. I like shows like this quite a bit. Things like Aldaramin in the sky, or sports shows for the same reason, especially ones like days and yowamushi pedal, where the protagonist has a strong positive effect on those around him. That said, you can feel the jags in the  plot. Especially how they just say ""oh by the way these 2 guys are his best friends"" If you are like me you will say ""Wait wut?"" and wonder how exactly that happened. But, I can forgive that because you get that same chance at those same kinds of feelings from how he builds his team. However if it leads to this show not having enough material to go past 1 or 2 seasons thats going to be a shame.""Central Genius"" Shows arent new, but they seem to be doing quite a nice job with this one at episode 3 and hopefully it will continue to build to a strong season end.",3
knights-magic,"The first episode did a very good job of hooking my attention.  It's fast paced but does an excellent job of introducing our basic characters while at the same time giving us the history of our protagonist(s).  It's a little generic in the sense that our main character is reincarnated into an alternate universe but it has a unique take on it.  I'm very excited to see where this goes.  Especially after we've caught up to the character's ""real"" time and the main plot unfolds.",3
knights-magic,"This review so far is just for the first episode. I'm not like a huge mecha fan (not saying I don't like it, I'm just not hardcore about it or anything) but this show has really caught my interest, especially with the fantasy elements that are mixed in with it. The first episode throws a lot at you very quickly, with information and backstory that might normally take an anime 1-2 episodes to explain before getting to the core storyline. Despite that I didn't find myself lost or left behind, only wanting more by the end. If it keeps up, this show could be one of my favorites this season!EDIT (SPOILERS)So now, after 6 episodes, my opinion has changed somewhat. While I like how fastpaced the first episode was, it didn't really keep it up for the rest of the episodes so far. One thing I especially don't care for is the fact that they have not mentioned Ernie's past life or reincarnation once since the beginning. It seems like it was just used as an excuse to explain his unusually high intelligence and love for giant piloted robots, which doesn't even really need a reason beyond: this character was born especially smart and interested in mecha. Like, why even go to the trouble of showing the backstory of some nerd who died and was reincarnated in a world with giant robots if it's the last time it's going to come up? Maybe it'll impact the story later on, who knows, but for now it was completely pointless.This is by no means a BAD show imo, it's entertaining and cool I guess if you also are super into mecha, which is why I still rate it 3 stars. But the characters are all pretty flat with no development so far, except maybe one or two side characters. I'll most likely watch it through to the end, but I'm sad to say that after the 1st episode it hasn't really made an impact on me.",4
knights-magic,"i love this kids fascination with robots and at first i thought it was maybe a little silly or lame but it quickly grew on me. i honestly think this is one of the best anime stories i've seen yet, and it seems to hold a special place all of it's own. the cat and mouse games and the strategy the main character has to keep coming up with is fun as well..... i hope this gets another season & continues to remain at this quality level.",4
knights-magic,Some of the anime details are not the same as the manga. It's also more rushed and details are left out. There are some important details like how hard the main character has trained to become as powerful as he is. The manga also does not begin with the mc's life in danger. Instead the mc is depressed about the fact in this new world he couldn't make models anymore. There are many other things that are not the same at all. They could have put more effort to make it more like the manga. The anime is overall rushed and inaccurate.,5
knights-magic,"This is a hard one to rate as there's a lot of great things but also some holes so I'll start with saying my 4 stars come from a mecha fan.This in an isekai technomagic mecha fantasy which is exactly as much as it sounds like but it mostly pulls it off; my only real issue is it doesn't do much of anything with the isekai and it'd likely be better without it. It's really just there as as fanservice that only goes as far as half remembered dreams of mecha model-kit boxes with no real nods to great mechas or series of the past and it's better to pretend they aren't cannon and treat the main character as a prodigy since he has knowledge from the other world but not his memories and its sets up his awe of mecha in a way that doesn't require his fanboy qualities to carry over into the next life.That said both the technomagic system and world are interesting and with a season 2 happening we'll see more of the world, the mechas look great and the fights are fun to watch though the side character's battles feel more weighty than the main character's after his debut. Reminiscent of Grancrest War in a way with a smaller cast who get more screentime. Worth watching and a must watch if you like mecha.",5
knights-magic,"Me finishing this drama is a big step because I am absolutely not a fan of mecha but I loved the characters especially the eccentric cutie I also loved how there wasn't the unreasonable jealous rival within the school (I'm sorry but they get annoying). The thing I didn't like is that the story is very rushed. They are many many times in this drama where they could have slowed down the storyboard to paint a more complete picture. Instead, it looks like they were trying to show as much as possible while fitting it in these few episodes. I think they need to remake this but pace it.",5
knights-magic,If you are looking for a overpowered main character and have nothing against mechs i recommend this show to you. I myself dont like mech anime that much but i was enjoying this one the whole time. However it sometimes come off as rushed and suffers from little to no character development. most of the people you see remain static and just hangs around. The show pokes at some of the relationships and hints at love but nothing interesting happens on that front.,4
knights-magic,"As good as this anime is, it can't be anything but  okay at best. The story is like every other anime where the main character gets transported to another world and begins to make it his/her bitch. The action is amazing if I do say so myself, that coming from a guy who really doesn't enjoy gundam anime. The ending isn't satisfying at all, it leaves a lot of questions to be answered for the soul purpose of getting viewers to read the manga. It seems like it was cash grab that was cared about to an extent, but overall didn't matter to the author as long as it got people to pick up his manga. It's a good anime to watch if you wanna kill time, but I wouldn't get too into it since you'll ultimately feel let down by the end.",4
knights-magic,"This is an unbiased review based purely on my large amount of experience from watching many Animes (over 700), without knowing the source of this or where it came from.It is therefore purely based on watching this Anime by itself and in its entirety alone.I don't have the habit to watch Mecha Animes but as a friend recommended this Anime to me I gave it a run and was I really surprised at the quality it was made with.It has many likeable characters which have their own issues and over time overcome em too, they grow as people and learn, and adapt to the environment and situation they find themselves in.Personally, I love the characters in it! I especially love the main character, his closest female friend and the Princess of a country which will be shown later for those that didn't watch this yet.The story was surprisingly realistic for a fantasy genre and had a really smart pacing of the story in which it has shown the most relevant parts to the story in the right times and the right way.In compare with other Animes this Anime, in my personal opinion, has done the story and characters in the right way. Nothing was too much, there were insinuations which you need to figure out yourself too, which contributed for it being more realistic, nothing was given fully on the plate which I find would be a mistake, to reveal too much at a time I mean or not let the viewers figure things out on their own.I literally did forget that this anime was an Isekai (Another World) genre, it has never brought that to your attention, especially not by force as if it lacked any confidence. On the contrary, this Anime went full on with confidence and was truly like an adventure, an adventure of innovation and passion!Watching this Anime really filled me with inspiration, with passion and emotional strength I didn't know I could feel. It made me feel excited for life and the possibility it offers, it has the ability to show doors that you didn't see there before. This Anime has the ability to touch your heart in a way only this Anime can do.This Anime has a very positive and lightweight feel and it fills your heart with light, which may or may not touch it and show you a new perspective in life. Of course, if you open yourself to it and let it touch you, embrace it with what it has to offer to you.I saw allot of potential and I've opened myself to it, it has touched me in a special way and filled me with light and I hope it will do the same to you too!I personally love it and it is one of my most favorite now, I am really happy I got to watch such a well-done story in this form!For this reason, I truly recommend this Anime for everyone and for all-ages, it is truly remarkable and special in its own way!",5
knights-magic,come to be entertained by very cool giant robots battling each other and giant monsters. this isn't meant to change your life or blow your mind. that doesn't mean its stupid though or that you have to lower your expectations. i got exactly what i was expecting and was very satisfied. honestly better than a lot of Gundam anime. as original as aldnoah zero. story is fine. just dont think about it too hard. go with it.,4
knights-magic,"The Good:The show is gorgeous, visuals are always nice and the animation never seems to falter. Mech eye-candy if you will. But this is where the good just about ends.The Bad:The story is as bare bones as it can get. The main reason the conflict of this show seems to exist is so that people can show off how strong the main character's mechs are. There's little to no character development at all since the main character just seems to get everything they want. There's no struggle.After six episodes there are two female characters that absolutely love the main character for no reason at all. Making it feel like they are just there to swoon over the main character and nothing else. All the other characters are in constant awe of the main character as well. I don't feel any sense of tension or development while watching. Everything is far to obviously going to work out, which makes the story feel lazy. I wish I could have finished this show to give it a more full review but I was struggling far too much to continue watching. If you love big mechs with over the top fights and don't care too much about anything else give this show a go, otherwise you're going to be bored.",5
knights-magic,"Knights and magic isn't really special, but to me it's a lot of what I've wanted from an anime since i was young. Cool robots, good animation and action with said robots, a colorful tone that (usually) doesn't take itself too seriously, yet takes itself seriously enough to not be a kid show, fun characters, and a fantasy setting with mecha. Only problems i had with the show were that the pacing feels too fast at times and the main character was a little too over powered at times (also i was confused about if he had the mind of a 30 year old dude, or only remembered that he liked mecha model kits) also i think the show is to short. I really don't get why some people hate this show or think it's bad, I do think it's not for everyone though, if you are looking for a super serious war story like mobile suit gundam, or an over the top mecha with a hot-blooded protagonist like getter robo, you won't find those, what you find here is a mecha  that's kinda unique in it's own way, machines and magic coming together is something i love a lot and i do understand it isn't for everyone, but i certainly love it and can't wait for season",4
knights-magic,"The tag line for this anime had me hook line and sinker. And then the fact that the show actually explored and used it had me finishing and wanting more.Only problem is that the story telling mechanics are embarrassing. Interesting interpersonal developments and political intrigue are glossed over in exposition dumps, IN THE MIDDLE OF THE EPISODE, and you never get the sense that the main characters are actually in any danger of failure. That being said, the rare instance where we know everything will be okay, but not HOW are really well done and it is exciting to see Ernesti cracking codes and problems that no one else even thought to solve, with little more than his wits and broken mechs. Sadly those examples stop after he instantly gets infinite resources and unconditional governmental support.TL; DR: Five star concept, two star execution. Could have used a bit more George R.R. Martin influence.",3
knights-magic,"I loved the first half of it. But was rushed like those who read the manga, or was it a novel, say but I dont think its too bad. I found it funny and lighthearted... Second part ... I just hated that princess. You will know which one when she comes out even when she was"" redeemed "" just no. I never wanted to slap someone soo much before. I also didnt get how the character switch from caring about school to forget it lets fight this war. Did I miss that he and his friends graduated way early or something? Some things were just rushed.",4
knights-magic,"First, I will say that it was rushed. And that's why i give it a 4 star. I would have loved to watch more episodes of the in-between stuff that the novels offer but I guess they might have not had the budget to do so. I slowly been easing my way back into mecha anime. I find its really easy to understand, not feel lost in, and greatly enjoy. (I usually felt alot of pressure to try to understand mecha anime series that had too much going on) I really love fantasy as well so its a two and one for me. I recommend you give it a try. <3",4
knights-magic,"I understand some reviewers had dislike the story-line but they design a very good setting.I never read the manga but I do agree it mostly to promote model kits and toys.I did enjoy watching the anime for what its worth it was a very good Mecha action anime with magic. Story A young Japanese man who is a programmer and model kit enthusiast dies in a car accident.He is reincarnated as a child in an alternate world where magic and giant robots exist the name of the child is Ernesti Echevarria who has a dreams to ride giant robots called Silhouette Knights and Build them.First had to study magic which he advanced very well when he enter the Knight school and later became a prodigy. In a Knights training mission he manage to defeat a giant demon monster that attacked which he hijack a Silhouette Knight fromone of the pilots who ran in fear of the giant monster and defeated the monster and became a hero. I notice this anime has a lot of hidden references and easter eggs from other Mecha anime shows I watch in the past trying to tell a story you be surprise are in the anime.  AnimationThis is been made by 8-Bit Studios they have been know to help make anime's like  Infinite Stratos, and  Aquarion Evol with their style mixture of 3D and 2D Animation similar to Gonzo style Animation. I have to admit they did a decent job of making 3D and 2D balance in this anime to make it look smooth and simple. Sound Effects and Music They manage to get Masato Koda who is the music composer for this show for those that don't know he was video game music composer formerly employed by Capcom a long time ago best known for his work on the Devil May Cry and Monster Hunter series who did a good job of creating decent sound track for the anime. The sound effects sync very well with the Magic and Mecha.   The opening songs fhána the song  / Hello!My World!!  and the ending Ayaka Ohashi  the song - You & I  did alright job for the show. OverallThis Anime is very action packed if your into Mecha this is the anime for you, its not the best for character development if you want a good story but it has a interesting setting I did like.",4
knights-magic,As someone who has been keeping up with the slow manga adaptation of the novel I was pretty hyped this was getting an anime. I really enjoyed the story and how even though it's got mechs and magic it is more interested in giving it's characters time to shine and grow instead of being all about high paced action especially at the start.Then I watched the first episode which butchered something like the first 10-12 chapters of the manga into what looks like an all out action-mech like mess of garbage that just looks not terrible and sounds good. I now understand what it's like to get cat fished.,5
knights-magic,"I agree with a lot of the reviewers, the anime was a little of a rush.But I would most definitely say that it's an anime worth watching if you're just looking for a good time. Negative stress free.I loved the main characters personality, his drive, as well as his ability to win people over. None the less the hidden humor in everything was great as well. Giving some form of relief in all of the action that this anime packs. The thought process the characters go through is also pretty unique. It queues you into his thoughts as well as gives you a different perspective of him.All in all this is a well rounded anime in which I would recommend. Especially to those who are just getting into anime.",5
knights-magic,"This started out so well. It seemed a new take on an old premise, and I thought there would be more involved with the protagonist being both aware of and taking advantage of his new  life. It started well! But the character development stalled in the face of fights with new characters, new mechs that just seemed introduced out of thin air, with thin veneers of backstory, and too often removed all too quickly from the storyline. Perhaps a longer or 2nd season could have helped in the characterization and world-building, but by 2/3 of the way, I was just watching with little interest, hoping the story would improve, that the characters would get more fleshed out, that the world-building would amount to something. Nope. Spend your time elsewhere...",4
knights-magic,"This anime does deserve all 5 stars. I wish they'd make another 2 or 3 seasons of it. Or for those who hate seasons they can just call it ""another story"". The audience of the Crunchy Roll is tilted towards anime overwhelmed with fight and action, but I think this anime has an awesome balance of story and action. Some may say the main hero had not enough challenges, but that's also what I like in it. Less struggles more smiles and yet Knights, Magic, Robots.",4
knights-magic,"The other worldy aspect is tacked on and absolutely pointless. They could have just skipped the entire intro aspects and simply had the MC be a super genius since that is basically all he is. Despite the cliche moments all through out, the high impact energy actually makes for a really endearing production. Furthermore it has an opening that changes multiple times over the course of the show which for such a small thing, helped hype me up as it really showed the progress of the show.",5
knights-magic,"Its always great to see a mecha show where the pilots like what they do and were fighting for a great cause. Ernesti Echevalier is how all mecha pilots should be, full of enthusiasm and the ability to not get depressed by the situation. All the characters in this were great including the bad guys. Great mecha design and animation. Its shortness allows the story to move along at a great pace. Plenty of action!! This get a full recommendation from me!!",5
knights-magic,"First, let me get my rating criteria out of the way. For me, one star means the show is so atrocious I lose brain cells trying to wrap my mind around it, and it should be disposed of in the dust bin of history never to be seen again. Two stars means the show is so bad that it needs a complete rewrite, but the premise is at least deserving of that rewrite. Three stars means the show is mediocre and you can take or leave it, but it's not so bad it needs to be rewritten. Four stars means the show is actually very good, but is lacking one or more special ""X"" factors that would push it over the top. Finally, a five star show is one of those rare gems that's so amazing it literally helps define a generation of viewership whether individual viewers personally like it or not.Knight's & Magic is a tenuous 4. On the plus side the characters are amusing, the graphics are solid, the BGM and sound effects are respectable, the premise is neatly packaged, and the main draw of the story (all the mecha) is outlandish enough to be cool without becoming patently ridiculous. On the downside the characters are a little tropey, mixing cel-shading with 3d graphics doesn't always work (albeit, in this case, it worked most of the time), the SFX were recognizably canned imports (yes, all SFX are mostly canned imports, but does every reptilian kaiju have to have a remix of Godzilla's contrabass-with-a-resin-glove roar?), the plot feels rushed (although, reading the LN's, I must admit that every major plot point was hit with a bullseye and every time skip comes straight out of the author's hands), and the mecha designs look too futuristic for a medieval D&D world (though that's mostly thanks to the 3d rendering).In the end the pros outweighed the cons, resulting in a respectable 13 episode anime series that tells a complete story worth a watch (and even a re-watch or two), but the cons are still heavy enough to keep Knight's & Magic from five stars of glory.",1
knights-magic,"There is plenty of material here. In fact, there is far too much. This show feels as if it was planned for being 48 episodes and someone came in and ordered them to shove it into 13. This show takes the prize for having the absolute worst pacing I have ever seen. Some episodes have 4 or 5 distinct segments that each should have warranted their own episode. There are even points in the (well animated and interesting) action scenes that feel like you are watching it in fast forward! The degree to which this show is rushed and badly paced means none of the characters have anything resembling competent character development, the world building is the absolute bare minimum and there are incredibly abrupt time skips despite the character aging not at all throughout the show. Finally FAR FAR too much of the show is simply explained by a narrator.All that said, with some many complaints, why even 2 stars? Because despite all the above problems we still have a decent-ish fantasy - mecha anime hybrid that was quite fun to watch. There is enough material there that you can tell what they were going for and what they wanted to do - and those goals are good enough to make this show still watchable. Pros:Fun actionCool ideasMecha and Fantasy togetherCos:Literally the worst pacing I have ever seenSuper rushed - should have slowed down and been much longer.ZERO character development. Everyone in this show is little more than a cliche or a stereotype.",4
knights-magic,"Its a really generic power fantasy with blank character work and animation to match. on the upside the color palate hits some high notes and the designs of the mechs are only held back by the cg animation that is supposed to bring them to life.There is no reason to watch this, unless you have finished your backlog and really want a mech series with no regard of important elements that make a good narrative.",1
knights-magic,This anime is basic.If you want Mech in a fantasy world where the story has no fangs this is the anime for you. Minimal character development saved by fantastic art and fun technology progression. If this is your first run into the mech genre and you would like more. I suggest Esclaflowne which is fantastic or the first season of Iron blooded orphans (If you are happy with how season one ends stop there).,4
knights-magic,"Listen. I enjoyed the show as a whole. Let's just get that out of the way. It was really fun and had some good parts to it, however I did have quite a few problems with it. My biggest problem is that the pacing is really weird. Everything just feels very rushed, and to me it seemed like I didn't really know what the plot of the show was going to be until like halfway through. There are some good fight scenes in here, but a lot of them feel VERY anticlimactic, especially with some of the bigger villains. The magic system is never really talked about other than the fireball spell and the air spell, which is kind of a problem because it's half of the title. There's also little problems I have like them introducing too many characters that never get developed, no one ever ages beyond the initial time skip, by the end I honestly couldn't remember who some of the bad guys were, and halfway through they start adding sound effects to the OP and it's really annoying and jarring which sucks because I loved the song. I know I just listed a lot of negatives but honestly overall it was an enjoyable show if you don't want something too deep or thought-provoking. The soundtrack was pretty great, and the mech animations were pretty cool honestly. It was a fun watch but I wouldn't recommend it unless you ABSOLUTELY love the genre or just want a time sink. (Also he appears in the kid's body when he's already a few years old... so what happened to Ernesti's original consciousness????)",4
knights-magic,"Love the concept dislike everything else . . . Characters are dull and boring (including the MC), story development is sporadic, MC's powers don't even make sense(he was a programmer that built toy Gundam as a hobby, so therefore he can build thing that shouldn't be possible for humans to comprehend because it would take to long? learns in 3 months? then there is the stupid jolting lines some characters say that just make you go what? ""is this a prelude to war"" finally the narration please stop",4
knights-magic,Its very upbeat show. About a genius kid (5yrs old?) who is fascinated in the mechs that in habit his world. His name is Ernesti and his dream is to create his very own. Learning all he can about the magic at this school which powers most technology in his world.       He already has caught the eye of the king cause of his I.Q. and innovation in inventing things. If he could make a revolutionary mech which hasnt advanced in tech in 300 years. The king will aid Ernest in his goal if he is able to wow him with mech he has never seen before. Thus thats where its starts off.      The battle scenes is highlight of the anime. Making very cool planned out battles and they last very long. Great special effects. The show as well is animated very good and immerses you further in the story.      The kind Ernesti is very adorable as well. Very enthusiastic about goals. Most people mistake him for girl at 1st cause of his appearance. You cant help but root for him all the time cause even when I was little I had a big fascination with mechs as well so I can relate. (watched the 1st terminator when i was litttle.)          His VA really matches his said appearance. VAs in general never feel out of place in this anime.      My only gripe of this show is the mechs are all 3d. If you ever watch a show called gundam seed which has hand drawn mechs. In Gundam Seed the mechs are animated quite wonderfully. You would gladly agree if seen it.,3
knights-magic,"A really cool idea with a interesting protagonist! But the ease with which he accomplishes his goals makes the entire story feel like there's no real conflict. At several points, it feels as if there's about to be conflict, but nothing serious ever comes of it, even when a main antagonist is introduced. Great idea, cool visuals, but every character is one dimensional and uninteresting except for the protagonist.",4
knights-magic,"Characters each have their own little quirks but no real character development aside from dietrich (even then, his character development was miniscule). The show does bring some interesting ideas with the robots in a fantasy world. The MC is the typical dense protagonist that isn't interested in love and is only interested in his obsession (Robots in this case). I feel like the MC is a psychopath, he completely forgets his past life and doesn't hesitate in heading into danger. I also feel like the writer did NOT mean for the main character to be like this... It just suffers from poor writing.The side characters aren't any better, as they only serve to support the MC. I feel like some of the characters that have died and the older generation of the cast are the more interesting characters. A lot of stuff bothered me, in particular the forced drama in episode 9 that tries to make you care for characters you barely know. Overall, it's a fun show to watch, especially if you enjoy mechas. The mecha here have some cool designs (though there are better) and the concept is pretty creative. Don't watch it if you're looking for a shounen with deep characters and a layered story like FMA:B or HxH. This is just general wish fulfillment. Average show to watch while playing a game or working on something. I wish I can give it a 2.5 but since i can't, i just rounded it up.",5
knights-magic,"I wanted to like this show, I really did. Crunchyroll got basically no good anime this season, so I was really hoping this would get better with time, instead of worse. The setting and the plot itself are not the problem, and the art style is clean and looks nice. The setting is pretty typical for a ""journey in another world"" setting. Some random programmer who happens to be a giant robot nerd dies and is reborn in another world. Honestly, if they cut the first few minutes of the show and didn't even give us that information it would have made absolutely no difference to the story going forward. But the nice art style is failed by poor animation quality. Lots of static scenes of characters sitting around tables explaining things. Almost every single episode has at least one if not more scenes where the whole cast sits around a table and talk for a few minutes at a time. My explanation for my rating is somewhat long and spoiler heavy, so I'll just give a brief summary up front before going in deep.This is what it really breaks down to:-The writer does not maintain consistency of his world elements. A lot of the things that are explained turn out to have almost no consistency in the world just a couple episodes later. -Characters are incredibly flat. They can almost all be summarized with a few words, and have little personality beyond what can be understood in the first 2 minutes of their introduction. We can only assume that this is to cut down on character development scenes and focus on the awesome action sequences of giant robots fighting things, except...-The fight scenes are not very well animated. They are not fluid, and are barely interesting most of the time. Aesthetically the art style is nice to look at, and I'm sure the manga they ripped frame by frame to make this show looks great. But when the main appeal of your anime is great big fight scenes and scarce else, you better make absolutely certain that your fight scenes look and feel amazing. I'll give some more specifics under the spoilers.Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideSo basically we are introduced to a world where these great big robots are powered by a special engine called an ether reactor. Ernie, being the giant robot nerd that he is, wants to build his own robot. Which apparently he can't do because humans can't use the magic that is used to create them. Because only the Alfs can make these reactors, and they live in a tiny isolated village and are regarded as a national asset akin to nuclear weapons, aether reactors are really scarce and giant robot design has stagnated for 500 years. This is explained over the course of several episodes. The episode after they finish establishing how difficult it is to innovate these robots, the evil empire is introduced. They have successfully stolen an unfinished and buggy prototype robot from our MC Ernie. But when they are introduced they have not only successfully reverse engineered this revolutionary new design, they have managed to either build new or retrofit thousands of these new mechs practically overnight. So basically, everything the first 8 episodes or so established is totally blasted into pieces by the 9th episode. There is so many things wrong with this that it is a challenge to list them all. -First, the alfs are apparently a very rare race and are the only ones who can make aether reactors, which require very rare materials. Even if they wanted to make more reactors, they wouldn't necessarily be able to because of lack of material. So where does the Zaloudork (ok that's not its real name but I started calling it that in my head and I can't remember what it was called in the first place) Empire get all of its aether reactors? An empire that had apparently previously fallen from glory somehow managed to hold on to, craft, or otherwise acquire thousands of reactors that are so top secret and so precious that even the kings of some countries would have difficulty acquiring just one of them, can make these things like toyota corollas? What is this?-Second, we know for a fact that the model of mech stolen by the Zaloudork Empire was a prototype with a lot of problems, and was also the most revolutionary design ever seen since giant robots were first created. Setting aside how the Zaloudorks managed to get a hold of thousands and thousands of aether reactors, how in the world did they manage to reverse engineer, perfect, and retrofit or build all those new robots in almost no time at all? Unless I blinked and missed it, there was 2 time jumps in the storyline. The first was from when the reincarnated Ernie meets a robot for the first time to when he enters the academy, then again between him planning a prototype for the king and it being stolen. There is almost no time gap between it being stolen and the massive global offensive performed by the new-type mechs of the Zaloudork Empire. And since this whole attack was apparently a sneak attack that overran most of the neighboring countries in short order, there is no way they could have done something drastic like hiring massive numbers of workers to retool all those mechs in the span of a few months. Unless the spy agencies of the other kingdoms are utterly incompetent there is no way such a massive mobilization would have been pulled off.   Ok, forget the Zaloudork Empire's means of production. Let's talk about something specific to episode 9 and not even concerning the over-world inconsistencies I noted before. Let's talk about when Ernie overruns the Zaloudork outpost all by himself. So first of all, that fight scene was really lame in a lot of ways starting with weak animation, but it sets a precedent. Ernie's mech is unbelievably overpowered. It chops up the other new-type mechs guarding the outpost like fish on a chopping block. He is leading his supporting cast to infiltrate the Zaloudork occupied kingdom and save a princess. Reports of his party traveling towards the capitol are spread ahead and so the bad guys send an idiot of a miniboss to go try them out. This miniboss has a short fight with the supporting cast and then flies away in an airship to escape. The big question is, since Ernie and everyone are traveling together, and Ernie's giant overpowered mech is being pulled along with everyone... did he step out to take a piss and take his OP FLYING robot with him conveniently allowing the annoying miniboss to fly off? Where was Ernie during this whole last fight scene? Setting aside the fact that the miniboss himself was really lame and probably should have just met a horrible end on the spot, why didn't Ernie show up AT ALL for this fight when he is literally right there traveling with the convoy. If Ernie had shown up he could have chopped up all the enemy mechs and the miniboss in short order. Such blatant plot armor for an expendable character is just too much for me to take. Refer to Willing Suspension of Disbelief on tv tropes if you don't get where I'm coming from.   Overall it gets 1 star for being a vaguely different twist on giant robots and 1 star for having nice art. Everything else about this show is disappointing.",5
knights-magic,"Knight's & Magic - the grammar in the title is killing me to type. Henceforth, I shall be referring to this show as K&M. Whoever named it clearly didn't speak great English.You'd think the creators chose the genres at random. Fantasy, magic and mechs together aren't the first thing that would come to mind when you think typical. But that's precisely what it is; the blandest, most generic fantasy concept, mixed with the blandest, most generic mechs. Add a supposedly school-like back drop and some fraternal twin sidekicks, and there you have it. Honestly, the scenario sounds more interesting than it should, but what K&M lacks is execution.The core of the issue is the writers trying to cram too much story into 13 episodes. The pacing is awful. It lacks the essential, ""show instead of tell,"" element we see in anything remotely good. As a matter of fact, they should have scrapped the narration entirely. It feels like I'm reading a fantasy picture book that's trying to be as dry as non-fiction. K&M relies too much on the main protagonist and the pretty colours. Everyone else might as well be as personable as stage props.For me, the only saving grace it has is Erne himself. He's so bubbly, and enthusiastic, and sparkly you can't not dislike him. My favourite scene was that one in the first episode, where the teacher turns around to find student half the size - and age - as the rest, staring back with eyes so bright and eager to learn. But too much time is spent on him, and we learn next to nothing about anyone else.Unfortunately, the potential is wasted. It's a shame, but it's an illness we see all too often. Is my life richer after viewing? No. Would I go out of my way to see it if it weren't conveniently airing at this moment? No. Is K&M recommended to the reader? Not particularly, but if you have nothing better to do, it's not so bad you'll regret searing it into your retinas.",5
knights-magic,"Its an original idea and I like the concept a lot, its just so rushed that I'm not even sure how much time has passed in the span of 10 episodes. Maybe 3 years? There's no tension, One project is started and completed in the span of an episode when it takes months to complete it in their time.  Honestly could have been a very good show, and I was pretty stoked after the first episode, now its just taxing.",5
knights-magic,"I have seen the first nine episodes, hoping that the show would correct the major issues and become what I hoped it would be, but have given up hope.  The major issues I have with the show is 1.Pacing – limited world building, underlying story seems to be “let’s get to the next mecha battle as fast as we can!) Story lines that start up and then are dropped without explanation.2.Lead protagonist issues – inappropriate laughter (I guess trying to show his love of mecha), verbalizing obvious statements,  no connection with back story of Japanese mecha fan other than desire to ride mecha, basically declaring war with no hesitation.  etc...3.Story/narration - narrator foreshadowing something 15 seconds before it occurs, no respect for audience ability to see what is happening, instead it feels the need to state the obvious via character lines.  Size mismatch between original operators and lead, but cabin readjust for his size even though a big deal is made about him not being tall enough to operate.  And last but not least, Airships that are a total surprise, but look like the end results of years of advancements… you would expect craft able to carry just one mecha, not the equivalent of aircraft carriers!4.Animation.. does the moe pretty well, battle shows cuts through where the riders are in a mecha in an obviously fatal strike then later you see people crawling out of the suit unharmed ala A Team.",5
knights-magic,"Like the title with the grammatically incorrect placement of an apostrophe; Knight's & Magic isn't generally concerned with the little things. . . until it's ready to zoom in to the smallest detail. Most of the narrative is told through a narrator informing us that a lot of time has passed since the last scene, and lots of boring, but important stuff has happened. Between narrative exposition, we get scenes focused in on specific critical moments. Most anime and television does this to a certain degree (we typically don't have to sit through our MC taking a dump or brushing his teeth, for example) but Knight's & Magic takes this to Nth degree and somehow makes it work. And of course, Knight's and Magic is trying to be All the Anime. It's a magical, medieval fantasy with knights; kings; grumpy, arrogant, elder advisors; princes; princesses; elves; and demonic monsters. It's a Giant robot adventure that deep dives into the details and engineering of Mechs. It's an everyman awakens in a fantasy world. It's a story about a boy genius who gleefully pursues his hobbies and radically alters the world as a result. It's a military drama with strategy and spy-craft. It's a story about a small group of friends led by an amazingly talented leader rising up and taking on a destiny greater than they could have ever imagined. It's 8 episodes in and the world is fast becoming more fully developed than many stories with hundreds of episodes. It manages to pull all of this off without being terrible, but actually being pretty entertaining. Yes, it certainly feels rushed and I'm sure that a lot of us would love to see this world unfold over a few hundred episodes. . . but this is clearly a 13 to 28 episode series - as is 98% of Anime - and while we might be getting the cliff's notes version of the story, at least we're getting the whole story instead of just the prelude.",5
granblue-fantasy-the-animation,"So I would recommend not watching the last two episodes, not because we tragically lose characters or anything.  Just because they're freaking stupid.Story/Setting - 4/5 - A perfectly fine story in a pretty cool setting.  The world consists of a series of sky-islands each with its own unique geography and culture.  Cool.  The story is basically a sandbox adventure where we travel around in a neat flying blimp-boat.  You had me at flying blimp-boat.Writing - 2/5 - The writing is not great.  The writing is abysmally bad if you consider the last two episodes.  In general the dialog is weird and not very authentic feeling.  The show lacks anything resembling grit, and all the characters pretty much get along except for our token bad guys.Characters -1/5 - The characters in this show are all painfully boring, underdeveloped, and lacking in personality.  They all just get along all the time.  Like... Why is Katalina, who worked for the evil empire, such a nice, just, valiant person from the get go?  I can't imagine her ever being in the Empire.  Can't we get a few flaws for our characters?  Shortcomings?  Something to complicate them even just a little? If we played a game where I described a character and had you try to guess who I was talking about, I doubt we'd get a single match, because the characters have no personalities or defining characteristics.  Except maybe our grumpy pilot.   And don't get me started on the completely unnecessary host of side characters dropped on us like so many sad little bombs at the end.Artwork - 5/5 - This show is gorgeous.  Probably worth watching just for that.Voice acting - Largely left me wanting to strangle myself.  The show sounds like a bunch of teenage girls walking around a candy store going ""Ooooooo!   Ahhhhhhh!""Over All - 3/5 - Beautiful art and a cool setting make the show worth watching if you like adventure/fantasy.  An unadvanced, largely directionless plot and boring characters keep this from being rated higher.",4
granblue-fantasy-the-animation,"I've been keeping up with this anime despite the pretty flat looking art style. I'll start off by saying what I like about GranBlue Fantasy.1st: it reminds me of Final Fantasy, which I like.2nd: the animation is nice.And now onto what annoys me about this anime:1st: Flat looking art style. The cover looks way better than the anime.2nd: The violence in this anime is like rated pg13. Where's the blood spill from slashing those annoying Empire soldiers??3rd: If there is ACTUAL killing, then that annoying Mustache Empire dude would already been out of the picture, but noOOo lets keep him alive to make the story more ""interesting.""Granblue, at first, looks promising but falls short on a few things. It could have been a really sick anime, but the flat art style and lack luster violence kills it for me.",3
granblue-fantasy-the-animation,"There's a lot of promise here but the show doesn't deliver.  It's a fantasy in the tradition of  Record of the Lodess War in the sense that the main character starts out on an adventure while accumulating allies along the way.  It starts off with promise.  There is conflict, dragons and magic.  That's the first episode.  I made it to the end of episode seven before I decided, enough is enough.If you enjoy stories with cute mascots and a great deal of emotional back slapping, then you may like this.  The characters are juvenile. The adventures are not that adventurous.  This can only have been meant for preteens as it is not complex.  However, there is a good plot there.  It just went to waste.  It may be at a certain point (beyond episode 7 of 13) that it came together, however, episode 7 introduced a character so disturbing to my ear that I could not continue under ANY circumstance to subject my ears anymore.",5
granblue-fantasy-the-animation,"Honestly, I've tried to watch animes that were based on games before but most of the time the plot was way too confusing and you had to know the game in order to understand. This anime seems like a first where I can GET the plot! If that's the case then I'll be really pumped! Also the fact that the voice actor for the little dragon is Rie Kugimiya, the same voice actor for fairy tail's happy (the cat), also piqued my interest. (He's practically Happy reincarnated lol) I love the art for this show right away~ made me think of the anime grimgar fantasy and ash with its stunning artwork. It's worth watching for me just for those two reasons alone.",3
granblue-fantasy-the-animation,"...and the video game I guess.Granblue Fantasy is based of the mobile rpg of the same name, and incidentally the manga adaptation.  It follows the classic fantasy-rpg setup of boy meets mystical girl and defends her from the kingdom that's hunting them.  The plot is rather generic, but you're not here for the plot.Let me just say, we haven't seen art and animation like this in years (maybe even in a decade).  Every character is hand drawn, backgrounds are painted, and everything just flows so beautifully Grandblue is a treat to watch.  Oh yeah, Lyria is cute and Katalina is gorgeous, so the waifu is strong with this one as well.Unfortunately there are negatives, and they're glaring as well.  First off, the plot is nothing you haven't seen before.  Second, there's CG.  In a visual spectacle such as this, where so much time, effort, and care was taken in drawing every frame, would they include CG monsters?  It breaks from the classic feel of the theme, and is overall a bad decision at concept.  The CG itself is passable, but not at the level of something like God Eater.But despite my misgivings, this is still an unexpected treat.  While not a contender for anime of the year (or season as Konosuba! S2 has everything else beat by a long shot), it's still a great watch.",2
granblue-fantasy-the-animation,"This is a very well done high fantasy adventure with knights and dragons, and wizards; it is set in a realm of magic and steampunk.   Apparently, humanity and the other races (we see elves [Harvin] in the intro to the next episode) live on ""islands"" floating in the air.  The animation is excellent, and the characters are likable, though undeveloped thus far. The music is excellent, also. It is the story of a village boy, Gran, who trains as a knight, and his companion, a talking baby dragon (or flying lizard) named Vyrnso. He seeks to visit his father at Estalucia, the Island of the Astrals.  A Battle-Airship is passing overhead and the captain-of-the-guard, Katalina, decides to rescue her charge, Lyria, from imprisonment by the Erste Empire and in escaping, fall into the forest near Gran's village.  And, thereby the adventure starts.   The story is often compared to the  Final Fantasy video game, and it is excellent, and I can't wait for the next part.",4
granblue-fantasy-the-animation,"Right of the bat, it needs to be mentioned that GRANBLUE FANTASY: The animation is an anime adaption of a video game series. The main character is based off of the male counterpart from the aforementioned game; though it looks like the female counterpart will be making it in to some bonus episodes.As for the anime itself, it is a bit slow moving; but this seems somewhat intended with the chosen art-style and tone of music likely aiming for something more carefree. In many ways, this anime feels like it touches more on 'artistic' value then it does 'story'; which can be taken as either a plus or minus depending on who is watching.Is it worth watching? Possibly. I don't feel as if I am really missing anything watching this anime, as opposed to just checking out the game. I definitely have enjoyed it enough that I was interested in checking up a bit on this game to see what it might be all about. Speaking of - it is worth noting that GranBlue draws heavy influence from Final Fantasy; which was more then hinted at with Bahumut, and confirmed with Tiamat. I'm not sure if GranBlue will be available on English; though it looks as if some workarounds are available for those who want to check out the game.",4
granblue-fantasy-the-animation,"There is so much wasted potential here. This is a fun fantasy series, with gorgeous animation and piles of cool ideas. And it's all wrapped up in a creative and interesting setting. But shoving the show into 1 season of 12-13 episodes is a massive waste. Episode 12 seems to scream that there wont be a second season and this was all just an expensive commercial for the game. That's really a shame.Pros:Good animationGood musicLots of good ideasCons:Wasted potential, so much wasted potential...",5
granblue-fantasy-the-animation,"Another video game adaptation into anime for this cycle. It seems we are getting a bunch for the coming year. So I gave this 4/5 because I feel that it has a lot of potential. Albeit if you are reading this I only watched 2 episodes and I played none of the Granblue games. So just know that this 4/5 is a coming from a complete blank slate. Pros: -If you love Fantasy anime then I believe you will love this. World building is done fairly well. The addition of a ""sky world"" has been visited by other mediums. If you liked the One Piece arc in the sky then Granblue is right up your alley. -The animation style is by far the best thing about this anime. It has a style reminiscent of the Final Fantasy Tactics but with a bit more anime-flair. The fight scenes are clean and fluid, not outstanding but it does the job to show character strengths. -The music is partly composed by Nobuo Uematsu, so I am guessing they got a lot from the Granblue games which is a big plus because the world and the music work in tandem together. OP is another plus, Bump of Chicken songs are top tier J-Pop in my opinion. Cons: -The plot is nothing short of common at this point. Mysterious people who have tremendous power but disappeared. Princess-like heroine needs help from a Empire looking to abuse said power. Wide-eyed honest boy looking for adventure in search of Dad accompanied by cheeky animal side kick. Granblue is unfortunately shacked by it's video game counterpart playing to the mobile video game community.  However, I believe there is still room for improvement in this area. -Character development should be the focus come the next few episodes. But if they fail with shallow character relationships then this will be another big Con for Granblue.OVERALL: I think there is a lot of potential to build an entertaining anime here. A grand adventure amongst the skies. The animation and the music is already there. The hollow plot is a consequent of the video game plot so I think it fair to let that go. With only two episodes I'm excited to see more!",4
granblue-fantasy-the-animation,"Final Fantasy is about as formulaic as they come, but who hasn't wanted a series done in the same animation style as the cutscenes? I mean, if you're happy with Advent Children, I guess you'd be content without it, but c'mon. Same with the World of Warcraft movie! It wasn't ""terrible"", but watching WoW game cutscenes, who hasn't thought just once: ""I wish they would make this into a movie.""The art style of Final Fantasy XII concept art with the storyline of just about any JRPG/kitchen-boy-to-chosen-one-fantasy and, voila! You have Granblue Fantasy: The Animation.It's fun, the character design is adorable and badass at the same time, the story is light and entertaining, the animation is solid enough, what's not to love?It's a great watch with some great potential, so let's get these view numbers up without judging too harshly, you're not watching this to learn anything.",3
granblue-fantasy-the-animation,"The show is so peculiar that I find it hard to find the right words to describe it. The plot of season one wasn't anything too special: our skyfarers arrive in a new location by chance or quest, there's a problem affecting the population concerning a primordial beast and sometimes the empire, a battle ensues to help the primordial beast be free from the empire's influence, our skyfarers leave, then repeat. Most of the show has a predictable outcome, but one that's hoped for. The art is downright solid and can be the only reason you watch the show. The characters don't have complicated pasts.Or at least shown in season 1.Now that season 2 is here, I'm excited to see the plot progress. The definite end of the entire franchise seems to be if or when Gran meets his father on the Island of the Astrals, but I doubt the anime will go that far in hopes of getting viewers to play the game. For whatever they decide to show, though, I'm ready.Finally, something that simply speaks volumes: Katalina in full plate armor. An anime for fanservice would find a way to show skin or cleavage, but they keep her fully covered as armor should be. Meaning the show is aiming for respectable characters, not dumb ones that fit a wet-dream role.I can't vouch for everything, but for the show to be based on a game and be this solid is impressive to me. I don't play the game, but I love the series.",4
granblue-fantasy-the-animation,"First off......I will explain that when it comes to rating an anime, two of the biggest things for me are if the anime can hold my interest and if I found it enjoyable to watch. Since these are both true, this rating may seem higher than one would expect with the amount of things I nitpick. Elaborating further, if Crunchyroll allowed half ratings, I would give this anime a 3.5/5. However, since they do not, I feel this anime is more deserving of a 4/5 instead of a 3/5.Pros:- Character Development: For most of the main characters, the viewer is given enough backstory and allowed enough depth into the characters that one cares enough for them and is pulled into their story and the grand adventure.- Enjoyable Story: For the most part, the story itself is enjoyable to watch if one gives it a chance.Cons:- Slow............: If you are looking for a fast paced, action filled, fantasy world, do not watch this. This anime takes its time, sometimes too much time, getting through each plot point. If slow story with occasional action is not your style, i would not recommend this.- (Some) Action Scenes Look too Easy: Some of the fights went by in the blink of an eye, the protagonists defeating the enemy like they were nothing, then the next fight could last for a while. This made some of the action parts throughout the anime extremely unenjoyable.- Ending: If this anime does not get a second season, many viewers will forever feel unfulfilled by how the season ended.Nitpicks:1. At first, the animation style of the characters was very off putting compared to the background they were against. While I got over this a few episodes in, there were still times when this was evident.Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hide2. Near the beginning, before heading out on their journey, they made a point to mention that now that Gran was linked to Lyria, long distance separation could weaken, or even kill, Gran. However, throughout the entire series, this plot point was never used in any way.3. The PG-13 thing of never killing off any of the main bad guys but totally not caring about the lives of the soldiers protecting those evil characters (Episode 13 made fun of this fact).4. There are so many unfinished plot points. How did Apollo become the Black Knight? Can we get more of an explanation as to who Rosetta is? What about the two treasure hunters from episode 8, who are they? Who are the Lumiel Order of the Holy Knights and all of the backstories for the 9 NEW CHARACTERS INTRODUCED IN EPISODE 12, THE ACTUAL FINAL EPISODE? 5. Why end the show half way through the journey????? One of my biggest dislikes with anime is when the company decides to just end the adventure right in the middle before the main narrative has been completed. At the very least, you can end with a cliffhanger of sorts to lead into a second season; episode 12 just left me with an unfulfilled feeling.6. Why is ""Episode 13"" (Extra 1) even a thing? A single episode continuation of the 'story' set in an AU where Gran is actually Djeeta, a girl, but the journey is the same all the way up to them on the airship after the Leviathan fight, except for the fact that almost all of the 9 new characters introduced in episode 12 have also joined the crew??? And the episode focuses on them at a vacation resort, chilling on the beach and figuring out why there is no ice left??? We all know why this episode was made *coughcough* Fan service *coughcough*. I will say though, the off screen fight in the cave, with its death and gore sounds, did make me laugh, but that was the only good part of the episode.In Summary: Because of how the show progressed, ended, and all of the content added to the show in the true final episode, this anime is in desperate need of a second season. In my opinion, a 24 episode season would have worked a lot better with the show and their style of story telling, allowing for an actual ending instead of what the viewer gets: forced waiting for a second season. As it stands, however, this anime was a nice thing to watch in the evening that I watched it and I am looking forward to seeing this continued, hopefully.",4
granblue-fantasy-the-animation,"I'll admit I was nervous after seeing what happened with monster hunter and puzzles and dragons to name a couple, but wow, this so far has been incredible. The artwork is phenomenal along with the voice work. The plot isn't anything unique to start with but having played the game I know where it's going and it will come into its own. Which isn't to say that it isn't refreshing, this anime would have been one among many had it come out a decade or so ago, but lately there's been a shortage of really high quality sword and sorcery RPG-like anime (at least that I've seen personally).",4
granblue-fantasy-the-animation,"Though only two episodes are out at the moment, they were surprisingly captivating. The scenes and way the ""magic"" or ""skills"" , if you prefer either term, are very well incorporated into the show.

granblue-fantasy-the-animation,"Season 1 (4.5/5) I really enjoyed. Fresh environment and colorful animation, the game-turned-anime had a good start.

I don't know if they weren't actually planning on having a season 2, when the first season became a concept. But, something wasn't as interesting as the beginning. I still enjoyed watching our lovely band of friends, but it felt different. Looking forward to what Season 3 has to hold.",5
granblue-fantasy-the-animation,"I kinda like this show. It's story arc is ok. The characters are ok. But that's about it, it's just ok and nothing really special. It's definitely not the best anime out there, but it's decent. At times all the cutsie female voices are a bit much for me, high pitched and whiney at times, and that's anime for you, but I felt it's a bit excessive. The art work is pretty standard, if not a little plain and old school looking.",4
granblue-fantasy-the-animation,"I'm coming at this review from the perspective of a guy who actually plays the mobile game so bear with me. I won't analyze the story elements so much as try to explain why they're like that and where Cygames went wrong. I won't discuss anything else but all I'll say about music is I love the intro and most of the music is ripped from the game itself. The animation is what I expect from A1... choppy at times and beautiful at others. In the game I am at chapter 96 and rank 153 (if that last bit matters).  Wind is a stupid element. This anime covers the weakest point of Granblue Fantasy and goes up to Chapter 12 in the mobile game and the beginning of the Erste Empire arc. For perspective atm there are 124 chapters and we'll be entering the third arc. Later on in the mobile game (around chapter 30ish) the writing staff was reinforced with better writers and the story reflects it. However, this isn't a mobile game and Cygames had hindsight to draw from. An anime has about 3 episodes to catch your attention before people choose to get invested and sadly I have to say I only stayed on board because I wanted to see how this show played out. In a mobile game those that play usually understand that they are in it for the long haul and will put up with pacing issues or slow character development because that's how the medium works. Not in an anime and Cygames didn't understand this. One complaint is lack of character development outside of Rackam. In fact all these characters develop at some point and have deeper back stories when explored:Katalina was a rising star in the Empire.Eugen is a man with a regrettable past.Io is probably the one I'll excuse because her character development comes from interactions with another cast member we barely saw. Gran is as you see him but even he has choices to make later on. His connection to Vyrn runs deep and Vyrn is connected to Lyria. But you wouldn't know unless you played the mobile game.Rackam has a very deep connection to the Grancypher that shows up in chapter 30ish.Cygames could've approached these characters differently, choosing to show more of them then they did. Instead thet followed the slow format of the mobile game and did it sort of faithfully. That isn't a good thing considering it is the worst part of the story and it didn't translate well into anime format. They could've added more hooks for the audience to bite into. It's inexcusable when you can look back on your own game and fill in the story's weak points and make it anime friendly. Moving on to two more gripes... Episodes 12 and 13.Episode 12 had a bit of fan service introducing many of the gacha crew from Narmaya (butterfly girl) to Yodarha (old midget guy). This worries me because they all have great back stories but how can you cover so many characters over the course of a season? Unless Cygames invests in making OVAs for them then they can't do it without compromising the show. What is going on here?Episode 13 could've been better. It could've been an hour long OVA showing one of the many great side stories that double as beach episodes but went for the generic beach route instead. Sadly this is the episode they use Djeeta in. To give you some perspective Djeeta is the female MC in GBF the game. The player can switch freely from Djeeta to Gran as they wish. So essentially everything that happened to Gran happens to Djeeta. But anime doesn't work this way. They could have done introduced Djeeta better. Yet another example of how the mobile game can't just be translated over to the anime directly. AT LEAST PUT HER IN THE COVER ART! So while the anime only viewers are justified in thinking Gran was tossed aside they are technically wrong. This however, doesn't excuse the way Djeeta's introduction was handled. TL,DR: The anime suffers from being an almost direct copy of the mobile game's weakest point in the story. The two mediums aren't the same and it shows. Cygames needs to think about how to present this story in a more anime friendly fashion if it wants to bring more people into the Granblue universe. Handle Djeeta better. She needs more love... she's already nixed from GBFV so far as we know. Please make side story and character OVAs if you're introducing us to gacha characters. Naru deserves it. Hopefully they get the hint and season 2 will be stronger. Especially since, assuming one episode=One chapter, we'll be seeing 3 more interesting characters in Rosetta, Vira and Ferry... yes the same Ferry as the fighting game.",3
granblue-fantasy-the-animation,"There is so many  things this anime gets right and yet so many things it gets wrong. The writing needs work and that’s just putting it mildly. Random side characters that were dropped in out of nowhere.Can someone please tell me why did they change the lead character?Now there is no hope for this anime after getting rid of the one role that could have been developed fantastically if they weren’t so stupid. That was a really dumb call because you just Alienated an entire source by making this anime a fantasy chick flick. By ripping the romance novelty right from under our feet, they have doomed this anime to fail hard. I can’t in good conscience recommend this anime after these poor discussion. Everything falls apart in episode 13, this anime could have been so good but alas it was all for not.  Idiots",4
granblue-fantasy-the-animation,"I've rewatched Granblue Fantasy and tried my damndest to like it, I really did. There's something in it that's drew me in. I like the art design. I liked the promise of adventure and seeing new sights. I liked the few moments of action in between the long - and I mean long - transition of exposition between scenes. And that's where GBF:TA falls flat. In spite of its surface beauty and promise of adventure, it just kind of drags along from point A to point B with no true feeling of tension or gravitas. The characters feel dry and underdeveloped, lacking anything that would make you relate to any of them... although strangely enough, the one character that really truly feels developed is actually an alternate gender-bent version of the main character in the last episode - and that is JARRING. It has potential, but just lacks substance and character. It's like biting into a really nice looking piece of chocolate and expecting a delicious filling of some kind, only to find out the chocolate is hollow. It was somewhat tasty at first bite, but leaves you yearning for more. As it stands, GBF:TA is a lesson of how to avoid writing a disengaging script for an anime. And it's such a shame too, because I really did like everything else the series potentially had to offer. Just give me more to bite on next time.",5
granblue-fantasy-the-animation,"I don't write anime reviews very often, but here I am writing on a series that isn't very good.  The first two episodes were decent, but I ended up not watching it for a while.  Picked it up again and stopped around episode 7 or 8 for the rest of the summer until this week.This could have been decent, but turned out very poor, especially the end.  With the last break and coming back, jumping back into it seemed as if the story had skipped ahead.  So I didn't pay much attention and used it more for background noise.  Then suddenly there was an army of a couple weak guys, and a ton of super OP girls.  They beat another ""boss"", had more people join the army of travelers, and changed the main character into a girl and did a final episode at a beach instead of adding to the story.  Probably knowing they weren't getting another season, as their writing was poor for the entire series.I finished it mostly to take it off of my already large queue list of series I actually like  and ended(hoping for more seasons on most!) and those I like and still running.  You aren't missing anything if you skip this series.",5
granblue-fantasy-the-animation,"Note: This review is based off the first season of GRANBLUE FANTASY: The Animation. I never played the game. I just want to make that clear.To be honest, I just watched this show on a whim. There were only two episodes out in January, and it looked pretty, so I watched it on a slow afternoon. Thirteen episodes later, it is time to write a review, and boy do I have a lot to say. This show is incredibly divisive to me, with a large amount of pros and cons.First, lets begin with the pros. The visuals are absolutely beautiful. Whenever they introduced a new island or area, my jaw always hit the floor. Every shot is gorgeous and breath-taking. The original sound track for GRANBLUE FANTASY was amazing. The music added to each situation perfectly. In addition to that, the OP and ED were two of my favorites from the season. The animation is smooth and flows well. This goes along with the visuals, but it is still a nice touch. Finally, the characters were well written. I found myself enjoying how they acted and their interactions between each other. Especially how Rackam and Io act towards each other. The voice actors added to this with perfect representations of their characters and well-written dialogue. Now, lets get to the cons. The story is unoriginal and not that well written. This is the biggest thing holding GRANBLUE FANTASY down. It is ok, but it never tries to be anything unique. The story also starts showing signs of wear at the end, with a rushed ending and many plot holes. This could be different for other people, but to me, the story was not that great or not presented well (I never played the game so I can't really say). The character facial animations can be flat out boring and emotionless at time. This is more of a minor problem, but it still bugs me greatly. Finally, there is the beach episode. This is a con in itself. That was probably one of the worst episodes I have watched in quite a while. Why does it exist? Why?To be honest, I would like to see a second season of the show. It was not that bad and I did end up continuing the show all the way through the season, when I dropped many others. I do hope that they fix the problems of the story. That is the biggest issue and if fixed, this show could rise from ok to amazing. If you want to watch it, go ahead, but know that there are some serious flaws to consider before starting the show. Overall Rating: 7/10",4
granblue-fantasy-the-animation,"I was so excited when the first two episodes released. I watched them right away and was sad for the long wait for the rest. However, I was not disappointed. Episodes 1-12 were amazing. I feel 13 wasn't necessary. Yes I understand Djeeta is a a switchable character, I have played the game. Even as a person who plays female characters, I opted for Gran. I just much prefer his character. I hope for more episodes, but the story continues as Gran and not Djeeta - and definitely not flip flopping back and forth.",4
granblue-fantasy-the-animation,The final episode is complete fan service which is weird on a 13 episode series...  After that it was engaging and I wouldn't mind seeing a second season to resolve some of the more significant plot threads.  Enjoyable and consistent fantasy that never strays from the safe path but hits all the right notes anyway.  Probably deserves 3.5 stars but I can't give that and I enjoyed it more than I should have.,4
granblue-fantasy-the-animation,Has great visual appeal good settings and likable characters also has pretty much nothing new writing was inconsistent many unanswered questions. The fights were predictable as were the many powers displayed but I liked it anyway it was presented fairly well the different style of airships were interesting as were the many types of sentient creatures presented. Has very little fan service the English dub is pretty good and then episode 13 comes along and as someone who hasn't played the game or read the manga I'm totally confused as Gran is replaced by a female character I really thought that this was a dream and the character having it would wake up and everything would be as it was in the first 12 episodes this was a bad decision by the producers of this anime which already had some problems to start with as I mentioned above and I didn't mention all of them. I'm giving a high 3 rating here and a 6 on a 10 scale very mildly recommended.,5
granblue-fantasy-the-animation,"Judging by the intro, outro, and the first three episodes. This seems very much like One Piece set in an aerial fantasy setting. Different animation style(but fitting for the setting). This anime was a bit slow getting started and wasn't sure if it was going to be a simple monster collection show(never played the game) or if it was going to have more depth similar to an RPG(many have excellent stories with worlds capable of being adapted into anime). So far it hasn't disappointed and has the potential to be an excellent anime. As I watch more, I will update this review, but it is definitely on my watch list now.",5
granblue-fantasy-the-animation,"This is probably one of the best looking of the season- new anime based off a popular Cygames franchise. RPG based anime are usually not my cup of tea, but like Tales of Zestiria- Granblue is just beautiful and has a familiar Fantasy-Adventure story that's easy to get behind. All the characters- and I mean all of them- look really sharp. There are some downsides- it has an annoying flying dragon mascot with a more annoying voice that I want to drop-kick to the moon- but otherwise there's not much to complain about. I'll enjoy watching this one each week if just for the visuals.",5
granblue-fantasy-the-animation,"It is painfully obvious that it is based off a game all the way down to the fight scene music. The story is linear like that of a classic style RPG. But that doesn't make it bad. As long as you go into it know that is the case you'll find it to be enjoyable. It's not psychologically stimulating, but it's fun and that's just perfect for game-based anime. If I were judging it as an original series then I would certainly not rate it at 4 stars. But for what it is, it's pretty good. If you go into this expecting an original series and judge it based on that expectation then you're stupid and wrong.",5
granblue-fantasy-the-animation,"Backgrounds are beautifully rendered, but characters and figures look out of place against them due to their fuzzy, ill-defined linework. In some scenes, characters look as if they were cut out and pasted onto these photo-realistic backgrounds. It's somewhat jarring and distracting to the overall serious tone of the story so far, and sometimes breaks the immersion. 3D/CG visuals are great however, and actual animations are satisfactory. By the way, Nobuo Uematsu composes music for the series, so we can look forward to that.",5
granblue-fantasy-the-animation,"I compare Granblue Fantasy to a bag of aired out bag of potato chips that were already bland to begin with. They're a dime a dozen product that you can get anywhere, you already know what you're going to get when you bought them, and above all, they're not something you associate with quality. Sure, the chips are passable enough to eat them if there is nothing else to eat, but why should you have to be reduced to that option?This is a forgettable dime a dozen fantasy genre anime that does absolutely nothing to bring anything new to the table other than its unique art style.ts only saving grace is that it isn't ""bad"", but by the same token, it can't be called ""good"". (In particular, I've noticed this show borrows rather hard from a certain other popular franchise, but I'll leave contemplation on that to you if you decide to watch this)The art style of the show is actually kind of refreshing, but unfortunately they leave a significant portion of what they draw unrefined, leaving a majority of what is on screen to be left looking like something out of a sketchbook for the show, the only real exception to this is when the scene is mean to be moving and draw your attention. Otherwise, the animation itself flows just fine.The writing for this show is so incredibly uninspired, so predictable, so lazy, and so utterly bland that it can't be ignored. Everything that advances the plot is so utterly lazily staged that it can't be called natural, it is incredibly superficial and comes off as so painfully predictable that there is no tension, no wonder, no nothing. Everything that happens is either unnecessary or incredibly forced, leaving you with a sense that everything was just made up on the spot to keep the show going with no real sense of consistency in plot or development. This show also has a seriously bad issue of glossing over important details or just forgetting about something they mentioned entirely.The cast of characters in this show is going to be a hit and miss, as some characters are cut and paste cliches and others have some level of originality to them, but not by much. Overall, none of the characters have any depth to them whatsoever except for Lyria, the blue haired girl, but even then her personality is filled by the ""cliche and contrived tragic backstory that does nothing but serve as a half-assed MacGuffin."" That should tell you how badly one-dimensional all the characters are if the ""depth"" they have is relegated to something that was made on the spot to advance the plot via a flashback. All in all, none of the characters presented have any real depth, no meaningful aspirations, nothing. This goes both for the major characters and minor characters, both protagonists and antagonists. Conclusion:All in all, this anime is uninspired, unoriginal, flavorless, and incredibly predictable. If you have nothing better to watch, then sure, I'd say this is certainly better than a lot of the other dime a dozen animes out there and will serve as a decent time waster. However, if you're looking for a decent anime to enjoy, I'd say look elsewhere unless you're starving for more fantasy genre anime. But whatever you do, avoid the 13th episode. It's not a continuation of the show, and it is most certainly not worth your time. I was tempted to give this show a 2/5, but I decided it was passable enough to be considered ""average"", despite all it does wrong. And finally, I personally recommend the English Dub if you do decide to watch.",5
granblue-fantasy-the-animation,"7 episodes in and so far this is ""Meh.""The animation is great, aside from slightly jarring moments with CG (and all the janky movements that come with it), the music is wonderful, and I've run out of positives.It's a real shame the series doesn't capitalize on that. The characters are pretty dull and unrelatable, and the story is, so far, pretty absent. I really want to like it (yay fantasy and all that), but I just don't. There's good potential for the islands to be varied and for interesting characters to be introduced, but it says something about a series when I root for the villains.There are better and more enjoyable series available.",3
granblue-fantasy-the-animation,"The MC is the blandest garbage of a character I've seen.  He has nothing to defend himself with apart from a dinky sword that glowed orange for 2 seconds and glowed blue for 3 seconds, that's it.  By carried I mean the blue girl Lyria is always saving him and he even dies in the first episode, until he gets revived by her.  The only time when he's able to do anything significant in terms of power is when Lyria gives him power, otherwise, he would just be a kid with a sword.  In episode 12 we saw so many other characters that could have been more interesting if they were the MC because they have awesome abilities, like the guy with the crazy speed and thunder fists.  Overall, the MC sucks, isn't strong at all, and is totally bland and basic.",3
granblue-fantasy-the-animation,"The show reminds me of many great animes, with a story reminiscent of  One piece and  Secret of Cerulean Sand and animation like  God eater . yet the reason i give it 4 out of 5 stars is because the beginning reminds me of the beginning of  Cerberus (for those who haven't seen it, it has an amazing first episode but the rest of the series turns worse and worse with no real character development) so i'm kind of afraid that the show at some point wil rely on the good animation to gain more followers. But all in all, as of now it is a show worth watching.It's about a young boy named Gran and his lizard/dragon friend who go to help a mysterious girl named Lyria after her airship's exploded. With the help of her guardian Katalina they fight of soldiers from the empire and try to escape.",3
granblue-fantasy-the-animation,"2 episodes in, and before I did any research I already knew that this anime was based on an RPG, because it has RPG storytelling. While I do enjoy a good RPG, it does have an odd flow to it when it's being played out in anime form. It also hits a lot of the cliches you'd expect from a fantasy RPG. It's not that it's bad-I am sure I'll keep watching, but there's just nothing here that was new/original/compelling so far. So if you like fantasy or RPG's, by all means watch it. But have realistic expectations.",2
to-the-abandoned-sacred-beasts,"To start on a positive note, Animation is of top quality. Fluid, well drawn, colorful, crisp, no jarringly obvious CG detected. Character design is faithful to the source material. Argument to be made that they could have preserved the original art style (which notably used some very somber, dark tones), but let's be real - carrying over handdrawn style is very rare with anime adaptations. It's a good job.Onto the not so good, I read the manga up to about volume 4 (fell behind just because I got distracted by other stuff) and based on that was really looking forward to this series.However, I have to say the 1st episode is really sending up some red flags. Basic problem is that they pretty much info-dumped a lot of the underlying backstory in the first episode, which was slowly drip fed to you in the manga. The end result is none of the expected pacing, dramatic delivery, or somber tone from the manga at all.For those interested, the anime basically starts 2 months ahead of where the manga does, and pretty depicts every obscure past event, secret, and tragic happening which was revealed piece by piece thru flashbacks & dialogue over the course of the main characters journey in the books. Tragic secret of the beasts? Spoiled. Why Hank is hunting down his former comrades? Spoiled. Heck, they even show a great majority of the beasts and their powers... which very much spoils the 'monster of the week' factor the manga had going for it.I don't think it is un-salvageable, and plan to see it thru for a couple more episodes, but quite simply it is not a great start at all. Show runners have already put themselves in the position of recovering lost faith, and my anticipation has changed to worry & disappointment.",3.5
to-the-abandoned-sacred-beasts,"Before starting I saw a review that recommended I start from the 2nd episode and I decided to do just that. The first episode has a serious pacing problem as it's very rushed and I'd describe it as an ""info-bomb"" that didn't prepare itself very well. Watching the 2nd episode 1st remedies this by keeping the mystery intact by introducing us to one of the relatives of a main character. It's honestly almost as if it should've been this way from inception especially due to the dialogue in the first episode relating to said character in the second episode. I'm only two episodes in but I'm interested in seeing where  this goes after being extremely skeptic initially. If you start from the first episode you might not get the most out of this show",3
to-the-abandoned-sacred-beasts,"Significant violence and bloodshed throughout. Drawing and animation are good.The plot in the first episode feels very front-loaded. They packed a whole lot of story into the first episode. While it was by no means bad, it felt oddly structured. The events took place at a breakneck pace. Some of what happens feels like it should be very impactful, but since this is the very first episode, you don't have any strong ties to any characters yet. It made what could have been meaningful under other circumstances feel relatively shallow.The second episode however, was much better than the first. If anything the second episode should have been the first episode. It picks up from there, and while it doesn't move particularly fast, it's still entertaining throughout the season.Did I mention the bloodshed? Yeah, there's a lot of that.",4
to-the-abandoned-sacred-beasts,"Didn't read the source material so I don't come into this one with rose-tinted glasses like a lot of the other reviewers. If you want a throw-away anime about furry war heroes who are betrayed by society, this is your jam. It's kind of like if you removed all of the things that made Golden Kamuy great (art, story, food), but made up for it by replacing the soldiers with furries. And you got the concepts and artwork for the furries from a 6th grade class. I'm going to throw the word ""furry"" around a lot - not because I have strong feelings one way or the other about furries, but because that's what this show is about: people transforming into poorly anthropomorphosed animals.Art: 2/5. I saw reviews praising the art in this show and I have to wonder if the reviewers are time travelers from the 90s. The fights are not good. The peaceful scenes are not good. It's cheap and bad. Story concept: 2/5. I mean, I guess I could get on board with a bizarro American Civil War world where people wear purple and green cowboy hats, but it's just a throw-away setup for the furry anti-heroes, so it doesn't really matter. And the furry anti-heroes are really not that interesting or sympathetic. Writing: 2/5: Inconsistent at best, with lots of awkward transitions between fan service and emotional appeals. Sweeping plot elements from one episode disappear in the next. Side-roads that don't go anywhere other than to establish that a character is ""really driven."" A mustache-twirling bad guy who just wants to watch the world burn. Actually, I can relate to him, because this world sucks. The reviewers who have read the source material are pretty much uniform in saying that this show blazes through elements of the manga that were interesting and aims straight for the spectacle of fights, which might have worked if the art didn't suck.",4
to-the-abandoned-sacred-beasts,"The introduction is about two nations that went through civil war due to economical disputes. These sacred beasts are experimental, biological weapon of destruction which gave them the upper hand in the war, however it has a downside of the unknown. The ""technology"" has side effects which affects the soul of it's user. They messed up the initial story telling and character introduction. They could've made 3-5 episodes with the episode 1's story alone. It could've given us the opportunity to relate, like and hate to certain characters of the show before actually finishing the war. They simply thrown a ton of information and rushed it. I believe that in the manga the introduction is done better. I highly recommend that you read before you watch.  I don't even feel anything about the people, soldiers, sacred beasts that died in the anime. They just died. There is no special connection or sympathy. They could've done a better job tbh.In my opinion, the animation and art is quite superb however I'd give it a fair share of 7.5/10 overall for now, since it's just episode 1.",2
to-the-abandoned-sacred-beasts,"This is what happens when an author tries to justify perverse societal norms and a lot of the fans can see through the giant gaping holes in their rationalizations.In more detail, the ""moral"" metaphors in this anime are:-Killing your own soldiers when they return from war is a good thing, because they're too harsh and inconvenient during peace time.  In fact, they should just off themselves since they're too troublesome to even bother with.-The word ""soul"" doesn't really mean anything.-If you harm/damage/change someone, it's okay to kill them off if they're inconvenient to you, and if they fight back when you try to do that, THEY'RE the bad guys.On top of the disgusting ""morals"", the plot is weak and entirely predictable, and there's precisely one, single moment of character growth in the whole series so far, in the second episode.  No character growth at all after that.The fight scenes are also nothing to write home about.  Or even pay attention to.  Boring with predictable outcomes and no real consequences.",4
to-the-abandoned-sacred-beasts,"This show was a little interesting at first.  Soldiers turning into pokemon that were OP as hell seemed like a good idea.  Unfortunately whoever wrote the script for this had no idea what they were doing.  So many things get glossed over and it's just not as interesting as it should be.  You'd think monsters battling each other would be really intense, right?  But instead they are just kind of slow and boring and it feels like ""ehhhh who's next?"".Don't even get me started on Schal...At it's core though, this show will still likely satisfy some viewers.  It's not very good but if you like floppy action fights involving pokemon and werewolves and teenage girls then maybe you will still like it.",1
to-the-abandoned-sacred-beasts,"ASB is a story about soldiers who were given god-like powers and how they struggled after being returned to society. I was really looking forward to seeing how it would be adapted from it's manga. Honestly it's not worth watching. First episode front loads all the exposition giving Hank a tragic backstory. It was honestly the weakest part of the manga and something that should have been told much later when the main villain is introduced. Episoode 2 is where the story really starts. Schaal is introduced. Her tragedy is fleshed out really well. I'm fully invested in watching how her story unfolds up until the point where she meets Hank.This is where everything just falls apart. ASB shines best through the mini stories of each Incarnate told through a simple formula. Hank reminisces over what kind of person they were before or during the war. Schaal observes how their return damages the lives of those near them. Fight scene ends with introspection on deeper meanings of what it means to have humanity just before the Incarnate is killed. What keeps the manga from being an unbearably depressing drag is the lighthearted interactions between the Hank, Schaal and their supporting cast. This version abandoned all the character development and what's left is a dry bones telling of a man hunting down some monsters. Changes are expected in adaptations. Epitaphs of the Incarnates are cut shorter which is reasonable. But as of the end of the third episode none of our cast is interesting enough to warrant continuing this series. Just read the manga if you want to enjoy the story.",3
to-the-abandoned-sacred-beasts,"I don't watch horror or tragedies for a reason and this is pretty much a horror tragedy.  Thoroughly depressing and filled with people whose lives are destroyed over and over and end up dead.  This is not a story of redemption, but a story of one tragedy after another, which I'm guessing ends with the protagonist dying, or worse, committing suicide because he knows that he can't stay or he'll become a monster also.  Yeah, I'll pass on watching more.",1
to-the-abandoned-sacred-beasts,"I noticed that a lot of people on here are agreeing on the fact that they don't like the order of story being presented here compared to the manga. I would agree on that statement. It's hard to give a rating to something that you know is adapted from a good story. However, I'm here to judge the anime. overall the animation is smooth for the most part. Nothing to complain about Studio Mappa who usually dose a good job in the first couple of episodes. The voice acting is great and even though I don't like the fact they present characters too early they did a good job in expressing their personalities. Spoilers for the first 2 episodes:The reason why I don't like the way they put things in order because it takes away the mystery of the journey of Hank. In the first chapter (the later half of episode 2) we see Schaal try and get revenge on Hank for murdering her father. We all know that Hank is a great guy and how right he is in killing his teammates. So it takes away a lot from Schaal's journey and quest to see if Hank is right in his killings. You see, the later half of episode 2 is the first chapter of the story. We don't know if Hank is good or bad. We don't even get his whole backstory till a little later in the manga. It takes away a lot from the message of the story of saving people's humanity and seeing if our main character is really right. End Spoilers:Over all I still think it's a good watch and even with these problems they are minor and don't override the story for me.",1
to-the-abandoned-sacred-beasts,"Episode 1 is an exposition dump and montage of characters we'll only really meet once slowly losing their humanity.  The rest of the series is one off stories about a single character getting killed and what they were like before going to war.  The main character, Schaal, should be learning that these creatures have completely lost their humanity and killing them is necessary but instead maintains her desire to save them despite everything she's encountered.  Episode 8 even throws away the idea that they're losing their humanity by having one successfully regain her senses just to make the military officers hunting them the real monsters.",4
to-the-abandoned-sacred-beasts,"First off READ THE MANGATo the Abandoned Sacred Beasts commits something I like to call ""The Author Surrogate Sin"" where the character that we, the audience, are supposed to self-insert into as they learn about the world. The main girl is that character, in this adaptation, we already know the ""things"" she's just finding out so her profound observations come off more like she's patronizing us.There are other issues, like being unable to maintain a consistent tone (Boob joke into the Horrors of War back to the boob jokes in the span of 3 minutes) and having the cool moments get overshadowed by PLOT that is thrown at you with the subtly of a brick. It's action scenes are fun, and when they're actually keeping a tone it works. It's not good, it's okay, it's animation is okay, its story is okay, its characters are ok, it's just okay. Watch it if you're really hungering for something like this, but then you should just READ THE MANGA.",3.5
to-the-abandoned-sacred-beasts,"After watching the first episode, I'm very much looking forward to more. The action is well-paced so far. A unit of soldiers called ""Incarnates"" can transform into a variety of mighty beast-human hybrids. There's a civil war going on, with technology pretty much the same as the American Civil War. Naturally, the Incarnates have a huge advantage, but they can still be killed with sufficient firepower. The war isn't the focus of the show, though, despite early appearances. The focus is on the Incarnates themselves as things go very badly for them. The main character, Hank, is a likeable action hero, but he's ultimately facing the same tragic fate as the other Incarnates. We see the origin of the main villain, and our hero is motivated greatly to go after him Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideas his love interest Elaine is stuffed in the fridge.",3.5
to-the-abandoned-sacred-beasts,"First off I'd like to say that this show isn't really bad. It just isn't overwhelmingly good either.Our story follows our enigmatic loner hero dressed in an ominous white military uniform who was turned into a literal monster by the recent war. He is on a grand quest to put all of his former friends to rest because they were also turned into monsters. The worst of his old pals is his old friend turned scary crazy man, who also murdered his one true love. While on his adventure he meets up with a plucky sidekick girl who joins him on his quest to save the souls of his friends.If that plot seems eerily familiar, it might be because Gun X Sword is about an enigmatic loner hero in a black tuxedo who teams up with a plucky girl sidekick on his quest to track down the man who killed his bride, and every other anime from the late 90's and early 00's was also about war being bad and how terrible PTSD is.This show should have tickled all of my old anime nostalgia. The character designs, the writing, the art-style, everything. It's like this show was made when I was a kid, and then sealed away in a time-capsule to be released when I was old and jaded enough to appreciate the overt ""war makes us monsters"" metaphor. The problem is that there is a reason that I don't watch those old shows today, and this one kind of has all of those problems.",2
to-the-abandoned-sacred-beasts,"Make it through the first 4 episodes I would say and the show does develop different dynamics other than the Hank must kill 1 beast a show thing.  The animation is actually awesome, and there is not a character that I can say I dislike which is actually surprising.  I rarely write reviews, and this may even be my first.  I just think this show deserve a lil bit of love and nowhere near as much hate as people are giving it in the reviews.  I also watched the 2nd episode first like one of the reviews suggested, and it worked for me.",1
to-the-abandoned-sacred-beasts,"I absolutely adore this anime's art style and the character designs between the cast are pretty distinct! It definitely grabbed me in upon episode 1 and the reveal of the Incarnates' power but man- later down the line it quickly becomes mentally tiring to watch by the amount of despair and angst it has. It's a promising how in the first few episodes with the introduction of Schaal and her ideals of 'saving' the Incarnates from their seemingly inevitable fate but that quickly becomes next to an impossible feat with time and time again of either her, a military personnel, or Hank slaying them down. Even with EP 10: Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideSchaal eventually understands and fully accepts Hank's ideals with putting down the incarnates and her own unique hope of saving them is lost. It's more or less for worse when everyone else in the cast is pretty much hellbent on slaying Incarnates and believe it's the only way. It would have been super interesting to have Hank's (or any others') ideals challenged upon coming across an Incarnate that actually came from the bleak. Maybe there is a way to 'save the Soul' after all. When the world isn't hopeful at times along with its sadness, what's the point of being engaged with it?It's just a dull trudge near the end of the same pattern and outcomes. You already have an inkling of what'll happen by the end of each Incarnate encounter and it really feels like a chore to complete the anime if you're stubborn enough not to drop it. Sacred Beasts has SO much potential but it chose the streamline path instead. It's like a straight-shot without keeping you on your toes and you're exhausted by the end of it. As for the characters, I feel like Cain and Elaine among many others DEFINITELY should have been fleshed out. It feels like a 'save the princess' situation where the main antagonist is the bad guy because he's bad vibe. This definitely needed more episodes, or at least a better way of handling the scenes. EP 10:  Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideAND the first time we ever saw the making of an Incarnate 10 episodes in was completely without impact on me. Man, I really wish it was shown sooner... Just little things like that cement the hell they went through, the dark undergrowth of the series besides the present. It'd be nice. Part of me has the feeling it might be extended to Season 2 but if there ever is one, I wouldn't be interested. I love the show's concept but certainly not how the latter half was executed.",3
to-the-abandoned-sacred-beasts,"Despite this show being underrated this show amazes me, and still going. The combat is decent, intensity level is shown a lot, and Cain is literally the Dio (Jojo's Bizarre Adventure) of this show. Definitely, a must watch.You can have your own opinion on this show, whether you're watching or not, because you are missing out on one hell of a ride.Also, Liza is definitely my favorite character of this show.",5
to-the-abandoned-sacred-beasts,"It is a good monster vs monster slayer in a dark setting. It is however enormously depressing with its metaphor of CTE(athletes)  and PTSD(soldiers) rolled up into one big steaming roll of depression and candy wrapped with monster costumes. After coming to grips with that, you have to accept that the MC has to either eventually off himself in this story or they will find some cliché magic cure and he will live happily ever after with his jail bait sidekick. Both endings sound crappy i'm just hoping he ends it in a blaze of glory.",4
to-the-abandoned-sacred-beasts,"I want to like this and I'll give it another 2 episodes but I'm not impressed. I'm not highly critical of it yet either but for now it's just a bounty hunter anime with lots of action and ZERO substance. The first episode was so rushed, I quite frankly don't care about anyone in the anime. Ok, so he killed some ex-comrades...Who gives a hoot? Certainly not me.There is zero emotional impact on me. Why should I care that he's killing his friends, if he doesn't, oh wait, maybe this story should have been told at a different pace. Maybe each of his friends was important to him because there was a backstory for all of them.Well, there's no backstory, so I guess his friends are not that important and killing them, is as routine as washing your hands.",3
to-the-abandoned-sacred-beasts,This hurt a little bit. After watching the first episode I could only think of over dramatized T.V. Novellas. You are bombarded with lore and such that really feels empty. Characters are slightly built with many of them being introduced and dying off within the same episode. It all lacks a lot of impact and it is presented as though it's supposed to mean anything. TL;DR there's so much cheese in the first episode you could host a fondue party.,4
to-the-abandoned-sacred-beasts,"Did you see the drum roll? that scene in the beginning made my panties wet. If the art remains consistent, this story of Micheal Jackson vs Wolvarine seems promising. Captain Ahab must uphold the oath, and maybe find his white whale, who took a fatal breast wound; or just collect an assortment of grills to fill the void left in his pancreas when baby beluga took one for the team.",4
to-the-abandoned-sacred-beasts,"I was looking for something to keep me busy while waiting for new episodes of Demon Slayer. I decided to try ASB and found the first episode very enjoyable. The coolness of the special unit walking up to the fortress and wrecking it caught my attention, followed by the enjoyment of trying to identify the various mythological creatures. The double cross and reveal of the villain was predictable, just based on the character design, but oh well. After the first episode, things started to get a little boring for me. The introduction of Schaal added some emotional elements, but her character is boring and complacent. Would have much rather seen her continue to hunt down Hank rather than become his little puppy dog. The thing I still enjoy is watching the creators' vision on myths and how they bring them to life. Other than that, it is a pretty typical action anime with good guys/bad guys and the relationships they build up till everyone is friends.",3
to-the-abandoned-sacred-beasts,"It may be because I only started reading the manga after watching the show, but the timings are different and, where manga-Hank had 5 years to get over what happened at the end of the war (no spoilers here), anime-Hank had only a few months. He's broody and alienated from everyone else and it makes more sense than quipping jokes while hunting down friends (ok, small spoiler but this is practically why you're watching it so, like, relax). There are enough shows out there that have that kind of hero/story - I like how this one always hits me in the feels.Also, Schaal has more back-bone in the anime than in the manga, and I hardly enjoy her meh-ness in either, so that also counts in the anime's favour. Lastly, I would be remiss if I didn't mention the incredible artwork used for the end credits. I never skip.",3
to-the-abandoned-sacred-beasts,"It is very okay, it sets the standard of an ok anime. I find the purple haired girl very shallow in terms of character, and I would think the same of Hank if it wasn't for the first episode. It's only in the first episode where I saw some of his leadership, emotions, and background. Now he's just someone that doesn't really captivate me. The only reason why I'm still watching is because the idea of him killing his former comrades even though he doesn't want to and because he's fulfilling an oath they made together, it makes me want to see their oath through and sympathize with Hank along the way.",3.5
to-the-abandoned-sacred-beasts,"The animation quality is really good for now and it works as a pretty decent story on its own, so if you have no interest in reading the manga then this is a perfectly watchable show but not the best one to come out this season.  (I'm really digging Fire Force.)  But do yourself a favor and check out the first manga volume on Comixology or some other digital platform.  You won't regret it.  As others have said, the pacing is much better and the story unfolds much more naturally.  Also ...--- MILD SPOILER ALERT ---Whereas the anime paints the Incarnates going as simply going wild due to some sort of defect with the process that turned them into monsters in the first place, the manga makes it clear that it was mostly due to PTSD and other psychological changes caused by the horrors of war and the change in sentiment towards Incarnates from civilians after the war ended similar to how Vietnam War veterans were treated in the US after that war ended.  It's a much more complex and compelling narrative than what the anime portrays.",3.5
to-the-abandoned-sacred-beasts,"After watching the first episode I have some initial thoughts. I do think that the animation quality is fairly high and the combat scenes were overall satisfying. The first episode did cover a LOT of story points in a short amount of time, which may have been a slight bit rushed, but still overall alright. I did not have a big issue with the show trying to convey the overall message of the story quickly in the first episode, though I would have liked it to perhaps be a 40 min pilot instead which would have made it all feel more properly paced.while the story is only just beginning I have some hope that it could turn out well if done correctly moving forward. That coupled with the satisfying action so far made me give the first episode a cautious 4/5.Hopefully, the show can continue to prosper.",4
to-the-abandoned-sacred-beasts,"I was really hoping this first episode was going to draw me into this anime. I had a lot of expectations. Expecting Decent Animation/combat:First fight scene wasn't logical in any sense. Upon the first transformation, the HUGE dragon, I expecting cannon fire bombarding this guy, but NOPE. Said dragon flies and wreaks havoc unharmed despite being so large. In the next fight, they all seemed to die relatively pretty easy given they were regarded as ""gods"" by the anime. Then there was the revolver. Like whut? Everyone else has muskets, but the Captain belonging in the ""monster"" group has a revolver...?Plot:Don't know what the plot exactly is because I got so bored I stopped 3/4 of the way. However, a lot can be assumed from just the title. On another note, one of the things I enjoy the most is how the characters progress through the plot; whether they achieve or fail as time progresses. Thought it was kind of lame how the characters interacted with each other. My last straw was the Captain's last battle speech. I found it weird how someone deciding to confess could raise morale in the group when the group is certain of their inevitable death in the near future.Complaints:It was weird seeing a Captain, an authoritative figure, acting so chummy and gooey about love on the battlefield. To me, it was just all sorts of wrong.",5
to-the-abandoned-sacred-beasts,"For the first episode of a new show, it kind of threw you right in... They threw a lot of plot at you really fast... It's like the guy who tells you stories about people you don't know and acts like you were best friends with them as well... And the whole time you are thinking who are these people and who is this random guy who walked up to me telling me this story... The issue is once you have been watching anime as long as I have you tend to have seen it all... SO what really makes a show stand out, in the end, is the character development and the interactions between the different characters...The first episode was interesting in that  Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideit has a plot twist which made me wonder what will happen in the next episode... Because it made me want to see episode 2 i gave it 4 stars for now... So as far as watch-ability goes I will watch the next episode because I am interested to see what is going to happen next... So in that regard, the show was a sucess... Will it have staying power? I cant answer that yet... Will the characters develop over time I cant tell that yet... But what I can tell you is after watching the first episode (if you can make it to the end) you will want to watch the 2nd episode when it comes out...",5
to-the-abandoned-sacred-beasts,The anime so far only has 1 episode and it was pretty good in my opinion. I haven’t read the manga but I saw some reviews complaining how they rushed through “secrets” but honestly from what I hear I’m kind of glad they did cause I would rather not have something that seems like “Irregular at magic high school” where it takes 10 episodes for us to get even close to a comprehensive knowledge into what’s going on.,4
to-the-abandoned-sacred-beasts,"EDIT after Ep. 8: Well this is one more show which simply gets worse as it goes. The only thing the show has going for it is busty blondes and their male equivalents. There is a huge lack of writing integrity here. It's like the writers expect you to know things they haven't mentioned about the world. For example, the first 4 episodes are about how the people are handling the end of the war well, everyone is happy to just keep rebuilding, or at least happy not to be shelled daily.Then episode 5 happens, now the following avoids major spoilers but still, I want my review to stay, so... Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hide Madhouse, a guy we saw once, alone, now has a platoon of beasts. So this platoon makes sure to destroy a town, drive Hank the hero mad, start a war, declared a new nation smack in the middle of the recently united one, raise an army, garner citizen support, and convince some ""nobles"". Remember,  North and South were democratic republics, now we have nobles... What? Whe...? H...? The people were fed up because, the town got destroyed, so they joined with the Incarnate because a visible Incarnate destroyed the town. I'm not joking this is ep 5. In almost as many words!Oh, there's more. So what does Madhouse offer? Remember, the NOBLES and their sympathizers joined him, so he'll be offering riches, or easy life, maybe glory? Nope! EQUALITY! Literally quotes Marx's manifesto! No, I am not kidding, the kingdom, formed by nobles and soldiers, promises equality to win over their sympathetic citizens.You may say, ""that's realistic, people lie, its propaganda."" Yes, but this lie is hilariously transparent. Madhouse is the Supreme Leader, self appointed, there are no elections, unlike in the Union they are revolting against. The Union had a president, house and cabinet (not congress). This is just an unbelievable thing to happen, even in world with beastmen. Why would citizens leave a democracy to follow the nobles to institute socialism? What... How? Why? Why are politics in my Weekly Beasty show?! Who did this hamfisted butchering?! Moving on...Also the people in the 4 episodes north and south were war fatigued. They were, like I said, satiated simply living. There was no visible class strife other than for the beasts. The beasts, Incarnate sorry, were the only ones stirring trouble, living poorly or as hermits. So this class strife is out of nowhere. You thought I was done? No. There's more. Now, since this New Piora Nation is accepting Incarnates, in order to stop Incarnates from joining, The Piora Union is planing on killing all Incarnate. Unlike what Hank has been doing... Killing all Incarnates. Yes the twist is, their new plan is to continue the old plan. Without Hank, so that's different, see? No. Oh, and now, instead of using Incarnate to hunt Incarnate, they are simply killing them, regardless of sanity. Like Hank, but without him, so we're supposed to sympathize? Feel bad? Be surprised? Who is spilling their Emo into a Weekly Beast hunter show?! Who was that obtuse? You do feel some for the Incarnate, but then you remember they cheated in order to win a war, and you feel better (read bellow for clarity). Just horrible writing for the sake of no payoff. There is no legitimate reason for you to feel for the Incarnate. Oh and they keep translating it Incarnates, no. They think Incarnates is ploral for Incarnate. No. Incarnates is the action of incarnating, ""the Devil incarnates while devouring the soul..."" Incarnate is plural, like a sovereign isn't he or she but They. You do not refer to Queen Elizabeth as, ""she,"" but as ""They."" Bad writing and poor translations, are a bad mix. Should expect more from Comcast/NBC Universal  So, I took off one star. The animation is average, the music and acting can be asked for more, except for the end theme, and the writing is a horrible mess. If you watch this in a brain-in-hand stupor, you won't notice, but if you try to follow a coherent plot, forget it. Bellow are first impressions after ep 2.Aside from the main character looking like classic Wolverine, this anime has very little going for it. The animation was smooth for the most part, it's not very high detail though, ufotable's Demon [Slayer] has this beat. The music is acceptable, even good in parts, but the writing and direction absolutely kill the show. After all, if you don't have a story you simply have some animated monsters fighting.While I appreciate the buxom blonde in a short skirt fan service, I much prefer a good story. At least get me to suspend my disbelief for a moment. The show's description reads ""forbidden technology"" is used by the North to defeat the South. In the show that's repeated, but then the doctor who used this ""forbidden technology"" said it's the fruit of her ""top secret research"". I hope I don't have to explain why that's a contradiction, but I will anyway. To forbid something, it must be known, can't be a secret. Calling it ""forbidden technology"" implies that the South refuses to abuse their people, even if it means defeat. Two, it makes the North cheaters. I'm sorry but I really couldn't care less about what happens to cheaters. Any and all ills you get, you brought on yourself by cheating. These weren't unwilling participants. These were fully conscious, free, men and women who chose to kill people more honorable than them. That's your protagonist, how can you cheer for him in the slightest?So, the author couldn't make up his mind. Is this a ""forbidden technology"", or ""top secret research""? Since forbidden technology is used more often than secret research, I am going to say this is forbidden technology, which the South could have used, but chose not to. As such, the show is worthless to me, because I don't care about its protagonist or his ""friends"", the doctor, or any of the ""beasts"". They cheated and murdered, they deserve every ill which comes their way.And before you start drawing comparisons between the show and the American Civil War, the show never states there are, or ever were, slaves, or the emancipation there of. This was simply a war between two separate countries who use to be one. It was a war for power, ""unification"", one side wanted to rule the other. Nothing noble in that cause. This is closer to north vs south Vietnam, than the civil war in America.Edit: However if the contradiction is some sort of translation error, the show's writing is still not good. The information is blasted at you at highway speeds, there is no character building for the beasts, and the main character is kind of lame. Hank, or Harry, whatever his name is, loved his childhood friend but never told her? Remember this is a 20 something soldier dealing with death daily. This isn't some teenager with nothing more than tonight's homework on his mind. So, the manga could be great! Hey, I love the monster of the week style in a weekly shorts collection. But come on, as an anime, this is lame! You can pack whole paragraphs in a scene, unlike manga, this has the space to tell a story in a much more meat and potatoes way! This isn't quarter dollar instant ramen, I expect you to have marinated the meat and smoked the cheese! Instead, this anime opens up with a machinegun volley of contradicting information. Forbidden brand new top secret research. Next week: Jewish Capitalist Nazis invade Canada for the wool!<- this was after episode 2. Episode 5 we got Socialist Nobles fighting for Freedom! I can't believe I was so close with what was supposed to be a joke.",3
to-the-abandoned-sacred-beasts,"Democrats are not my favorite people, and whats more a nation of them... Aww jeez! That by itself made me slow to pick this up and spring a chance, but as a lover of everything that is anime I looked passed it and gave it a shot. Hey listen it was nor good or bad just that the deliverance was kinda forcefully rushed and not well thought out. It's like going to the beach fun while your there, but you end up getting stung by a jellyfish and having unwanted sand up  your crack!!",2
bungo-stray-dogs,"I don't even know where to begin with this anime. It's incredibly off beat and certainly doing its own thing, and to be frank, there's really nothing like it on Crunchy Roll. The visual style, production values and overall timing of the show are nothing short of spectacular. I really don't need to make this review very long because if you're tired of seeing high school stories and want something more mature but not heavy handed, this anime is for you, and it's bound to be a classic amongst the likes of Cowboy Bebop. No joke, this could be the next big mature anime series, so get in on the ground floor for this. If the first 5 minutes turn you off, DON'T STOP WATCHING. You'll be thrown for a loop in a hurry. Join a misfit band of superpowered detectives solving cases against other supers who dress like it's the 19th century using abilities that are unique and interesting. Sure, the mature lead has an ability most of us are familiar with, but don't think for a second that this series is even remotely like Charlotte. This is its own thing, set in a Victorian-but-modern city dripping with awesome style, goregous animation and quick wit. The only thing that I'm afraid of in this series is that it'll be short lived LIKE Charlotte because of how expensive it must be to produce... but if the end credit sequence is anything to go by, I think we could be in for a good 24 episodes in this season at least. That's it. Just watch it, and be hopeful they don't go back on their promise for a second--or maybe third--season.",4.5
bungo-stray-dogs,"HERE'S A VIDEO VERSION IN CASE YOU DON'T WANT TO READ THIS WHOLE REVIEW! https://youtu.be/3ZsmcmewhGYWhen it came to the Fall 2016 anime season, this was really the only show I kept up with. I don’t know if you can’t tell, but I don’t usually talk about trending topics and that’s usually because I’m not on top of the 10’s of shows coming out each season. I was kind of looking forward to this season because I wanted some closure from the cliffhanger that was the first season, but what I got was… unexpected to say the least. Just to recap my season 1 review, which you can watch right here if you click on the card icon on the top right corner of the video, I basically said that there were quite a bit of problems when it came to the pacing, storytelling, tone, and the fact that the show felt way too black and white. Some of the plot lines ended poorly and the detective episodes were quite poor.Well, some of these problems continue through to season 2, but season 2 also improves on a lot of these issues quite a bit. It also adds a couple more problems that I may have not picked up on, but it was an overall improvement. There’s a lot to get into so let’s get into it.*transition slide into story*I really have to split all of the parts of this review into 2 parts: The first 4 episodes of season 2 and the rest of the season. That’s because the first 4 episodes of season 2 are completely disjointed from the main conflict of season 2 because it’s a backstory to how the Agency was created and Dazai’s time in the Port Mafia. Let’s give this a bit of analysis before we jump into the main story.*transition slide into First 4 Episodes*The story follows a character named Oda who’s a low level member of the Port Mafia. Though, there are a couple things that are special about Oda. He’s the friend of one of the top members of the Port Mafia, Dazai Osamu and another random guy, Ango. He’s also gifted with an ability that lets him see a few seconds into the future, which is why he’s one of the best members of the agency even though he isn’t on the top.The set up for these 4 episodes is basically a detective story, but actually done right for the first time in this show’s history. That’s because the show has more time to set up the events of the mystery, have time to get sidetracked and explore some subplots, and give a good amount of characterization that makes me really like the main character. Even the side characters got some exploration and motivation as to why they do what they do. Some of these ideas connect to the main story, but the majority of the events don’t. These 4 episodes had more of an emotional impact because they added so much to the characters without overstepping the bounds of the story.The pacing in these 4 episodes is divine. They kept each event on screen long enough for the audience to understand what’s going on, but nothing overstayed its welcome. It managed to do in 4 episodes what the whole first season couldn’t do in its run time. The tone of these 4 episodes was always more serious and more focused on the plot. The show never broke into a different art style for the comedic scenes and even the scenes where Dazai was making suicide jokes were pretty toned down. It really felt like the show I wanted this whole show to be. The ending also left me quite satisfied as it closed up all of the subplots and created a direct link between Dazai in the Port Mafia and Dazai in the agency. Though there are a couple issues with these 4 episodes.I may not have noticed this in the first season, but this show really over explains every detail at points. Characters go on endless internal monologues that seem quite unnecessary because they show the same information on screen. It feels like a failsafe in case people didn’t catch onto the details on their own. This problem also exists in the rest of the series as well.Another issue is that the main motivation for what occurred in the final episode of this arc was quite weak. It was based around characters the audience barely ever saw and it was only implied that there was a close relationship between these characters. You’ll know what I mean if you watch the 3rd episode of season 2. It’s similar to Kyoka’s near death scene in season 1, but done slightly better. There’s just more room for improvement with the execution of this plot point.So, the characters and story are better overall compared to season 1, but what about the music? Well, the music is superb. Every track fits the tone quite well and there are many memorable songs that add to the mood. The opening scene of the show displays this perfectly and really lets the audience know what they’re getting into. The creativity with lighting and the use of credits in the OP of the show adds a couple bonus points in my books too since it shows that they weren’t being lazy with the execution of this backstory. It’s a shame that the OP’s got less creative as they continued since there are 3 OP animations that all go to the same song. The overall animation is nice and the director’s choices add an oomph that I didn’t expect. This can specifically be seen in the flashback scenes and in the final fight scene for the anime. The aesthetic for summoning abilities in this show changed from Japanese characters to English letters. It adds some more variety to the visuals as the words are moving to create a sense of explosiveness when summoning abilities. The themes explored in these 4 episodes laid some of the groundwork for later in the series. One of these themes had to do with grey morality and how it’s really tough to see who’s in the right most of the time. All of this combined compels me to give these 4 episodes a 7.5/10. Too bad the rest of the series brings this score down a little. We should get back to the rest of the series for the rest of this review.*Rest of the review card*Many of the points I’d make for the rest of this show has already been stated in my season 1 review. The tone switches too much in this show, though it was better in this season by a bit. The comedy gets in the way, but less often. The show is paced at a super speed so it feels like you’re getting 2 episodes in one. There’s a huge problem with over explaining details the show shows on screen and the detective episode is quite weak. Unlike season 1, less characters are explored and less characters are given characterization. This makes it hard to care about the conflict when the villains seem 1 dimensional and stale. Actually, the conflict in this season is a plus compared to last season. The show turned from a 1-dimensional conflict that was barely explored to a 3-way war that has stakes and loss. There are alliances, traps, and more. This also adds to the grey morality I mentioned earlier, but as I said, it isn’t as good as it could be because of the weak characterization of the American and European writers. There are also random shonen power-ups that ruin the tension because every time there’s a conflict, there’s a random power-up that makes everything an equal playing field. It makes the show feel like a wannabe dragonball Z, especially when the power-ups look like a budgeted version of a character going super saiyan. The character dynamics are quite improved and there’s a decent bit of character development. Two specific instances of note are between Dazai and his old partner in the Port Mafia as well as Aktagawa and Atsushi. The first dynamic has so much chemistry within itself since these characters knew each other for so long and it shows in how they fight.The second instance shows a lot of room for growth since these characters never fought together before a certain point in the show. It’s just too bad that the show left off on a cliffhanger for an even bigger plot line that seems to have been foreshadowed for quite a while. The worst part is that there’s not a confirmed season 3 so it really hinders this show. The flashbacks of Atsushi and the repetitive dialogue of how Kyouka killed 35 people also make the show drop in value as it’s unnecessary because the audience already knows about these events. I mean, we don’t need to see Atsushi’s backstory more than twice as a maximum because it never adds anything new to his character. I already talked about the music and animation in the “first 4 episodes” part and all of that stays true here except for the fact that the visuals for the OP in these episodes lacks creativity. The title card is placed poorly and what started as a gritty world turned into a generic shonen. It really doesn’t hold up to its seinen tag that is has for some reason.Overall, this show has tons of problems and some problems that bother me now more than they did when I reviewed season 1. The cliffhanger is bothersome and the weak characters make the conflict less compelling. The character dynamics are better and have more room to be explored while the themes are explored poorly. The pacing is a bit too fast, but it makes the show feel like it’s always progressing. The arc of this season ends decently, but ends with one of the biggest deus exmachina’s I’ve seen in a while and the explanations of simple ideas make this show harder to watch. Even with all of that, I give this show an 8/10… in terms of my enjoyment. It was one of the few shows I kept up with this season and it kept me hooked. On a critical level, the whole series is now a 5.5/10 because, as I said, some of the things I noticed as a problem in season 1 became bigger issues, like telling instead of showing. There are a few stand-out moments in this show that get overshadowed by the mediocrity.Season 2 alone is a midrange 6 out of 10 since it has the 4 episodes that are just great.",5
bungo-stray-dogs,"I have never read the manga this is based on, but so far after two episodes, this anime really holds up strong. EDIT: I just want to address some points that I've seen come up now.""There's too much comedy"": We got a taste of this in episode 3, but the series gets really dark and brutal. Having recently gone ahead and read the manga in my spare time I can say that for a fact. If you're put off by the comedy in the first 2 episodes don't be.""The ability names are stupid"": For this one you need to understand that the characters are based on literary greats (I mean, Bungou does pretty much mean  ""literary""). The ability of a user is a reference to the user's works in some way. ""No Longer Human"", for example, is the name of one of the real life Dazai's most beloved works. As nonsensical as the names are however, they're not as disconnected from what they do as some people seem to think: The name of Dazai's ability would be transliterated as ""extinguish that which makes you human"". The move ""extinguishes"" a user's ability. It's vague but it does tie. Doppo Poet, too, involves writing things down and ""bringing them to life"", which can be seen as a play on the more metaphorical way in which poetry does as such in real life. The list goes on too. All the powers names make sense in a vague way, while paying homage to the respective character's real life inspiration. I, personally, find it very clever.Anyway, now I've gotten that out of the way, the main point of this edit: Having seen the manga this is based on up to the 30 chapter mark, I can see that I'm in love with this series even more. Anyway, back to the actual review below which I wrote as a newbie to the series (I would have put this at the end of the review, but I wanted to address these points most of all) -_______________________________________________The animation is beautiful, and the characters movements all vibrantly pop to life. The premise is extremely interesting, and the characters are all quirky with their own lovable flavors. It's incredibly off the wall, as others have pointed out, but that adds to it's charm. I also went into this no realizing that the characters were based on literary greats, but now I do know as such, this anime has gotten me interested in researching the characters backgrounds, and their works, so that's a big added bonus.The writing is superb, balancing black comedy with a depth of character, and a serious underlying attitude - It's the sort of show that manages to balance it's humor at just the right place, allowing for some genuine depth and emotion to resonate from within the characters. When a show is able to make even suicide funny you know that it's going to be a good one. And this does it's black comedy superbly, never feeling in bad taste, yet never ceasing to push the boundaries either. And they somehow manage to make it feel respectful, despite itself.So far my biggest complaint is that the pacing has been a slight bit wonky at points, but that's a really big nitpick. So far this looks like a really great hidden gem. If this quality of animation & writing keeps up throughout the rest of the series, this is going to be one heck of a ride.",5
bungo-stray-dogs,"This has become one of my favorite anime ever. This anime has it's own style. It is easily the best anime of 2016 for me (along with Re: Zero). It has a motif of literature (like he names people after authors). There is a diverse group of characters. You will even like some villains. This anime doesn't leave you going ""ugh that's all I get?"" or the feeling of being left hanging. The endings are often suspenseful, but it leaves you craving for more, in the best way possible. Action, comedy, suspense, you name it BSD has it. The battle between the heroes and villains is a game of chess meets UFC with superpowers. The animation is beautiful. I personally find it best on CR on PS4 for some reason. Watch it. Love it. Demand Season 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10..",5
bungo-stray-dogs,"Seriously is a life changing type of anime. The characters they use, are depictions of real life authors/artists. It makes you go research the authors, then re-watch it to find little easter eggs... it's a totally re-newed experience.The storyline is a little comedic in season 1, but as soon as you hit season 2... it gets so awesome. I loved the beginning of season 2.Please watch and support this anime! I want more seasons.",5
bungo-stray-dogs,"This show has kept me hooked from the start of season 1 all the way through to where it's at. The character development and backstories are incredibly thought through and explained amazingly. You'll love one character and immediately fall in love with the next.The show has done an amazing job keeping the mystery aspect I love to see in shows with not just the story but with some of the characters. Even after learning a backstory of a character you still feel that mystery aspect towards them and I absolutely love that about the show.Each episode keeps you hooked, ready to click the next wondering what happens and in my opinion, that's one of the best things an anime can bring. No episode felt unimportant and I always kept going until I didn't have any more to watch.I can't wait to see where this show goes int he future!",5
bungo-stray-dogs,"Seriously, no other show has captured my attention like this one. There's something for everyone here; it's funny, it's dark, it's mysterious, it's dramatic, it's over-the-top, it's something much deeper than what it seems. The premise of the show is one of the most creative I've ever seen. Most of the characters contain a supernatural special ability, unique to each one of them, and those abilities are some of the most interesting and creative powers I've seen from a supernatural show in a long time. Even further, each character is named after a famous historical author, with all the Japanese characters holding the names of Japanese authors, American characters holding the names of American authors, et cetera; and the powers that each character has are based on one of the works of their namesake, as well as many other things about their stories and personalities. It's honestly one of the most enthralling parts of this show to me. Beyond the superficial parts such as that, the meat of the show itself doesn't fail to keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time. With complex, well-written characters, many of whom tread the line between ""good guy"" and ""bad guy"" so perfectly, an amazing plot that never fails to surprise you and reward you for watching further, and beautiful animation and soundtrack, there's very little I can say about this show that isn't the highest praise I've ever had for an anime.Seriously, watch this. You won't regret it. No matter what genre of anime you're into, no matter what you've watched in the past, you will love Bungou Stray Dogs.",5
bungo-stray-dogs,"[Review based up to episode 12, end of season 1]Comedy, action, supernatural, secretive organization, poverty, suicide...... this seems like a lot to take in, but Bungo Stray Dogs does it all, and it has a good plot and great characters.  It starts off more as a comedy but gets deeper as time goes on.  The animation is amazing, especially the backgrounds and the action sequences aren't bad too.All of the character's names are based on real Japanese authors.  It's interesting to see the parallels between these authors and the characters that bear their names.Here's a little bit of info about each author/character pair I found interesting.Atsushi Nakajima: main character in anime  (this spoiler is revealed at the end of episode 1)Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hidecan transform into a tiger Real Life Author: (1909-1942) Famous for his short story ""Sanetsuki"" (Tiger Poet) which is about a man who tries to become a great poet but ultimately goes mad and transforms into a tiger.  Despite this he eventually realizes his humanity and grows becuase of this experience.Osamu Dazai: supporting character in the anime, his ability allows him to cancel out other abilities.  He often tries to commit suicide (usually in a comedic way).  Real Life Author: (1909-1948)  Many of his works center around mental illness and human nature.  He also tried numerous times to commit suicide, finally succeeding in doing so by drowning in a river.Doppo Kunikida: supporting character in anime, his ability is call Doppo Poetry which allows him to create objects through writing on his notebook.Real Life Author: (1871-1908) Famous novelist and poet who brought in romanticism into Japan, and is famous for his lyrical poetry.  This series reminds me of Blood Blockade Battlefront and Fairy Tail in terms of supernatural powers and the idea of nakama/friendship.  The character designs are also a little reminescent of Soul Eater (the downward dropping eyes and facial structure) also the comedy is similar in taste.If you're looking for an action comedy that touches on tough topics, but stays pretty light and funny check out this show.  So far it looks like a show I'm going to stick with the rest of the season.",5
bungo-stray-dogs,"I think just pointing out something like its quite different art style is as good a place as any to start; something about the faces and specifically the eyes communicates so much more emotion than most other anime's I've seen. I love the connections to real-world authors both Japanese and abroad; the famous authors I could recognize from the character names were fun easter eggs while the Japanese authors I didn't know allowed me to learn and understand a small sliver of what Japanese literature was built upon the backs of. Character progression and a unique storyline also made this a fantastic work of art; it's honestly quite difficult to find any negatives when trying to write this review. I also personally love the blurred lines between the organizations and whether each leader or member is doing what's right in their own eyes. The struggling and the suffering certain characters are put through and try to grow past help strengthen, in my opinion, the overall story as well. The little comedic moments help break-up some the darker storylines and sometimes episodes could get a little abstract and weird, but that's something I would've missed so I'm not going to complain. All in all, it was/is a fantastic anime that I'd recommend wholeheartedly; hopefully there's another season in the future?",5
bungo-stray-dogs,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I started watching this series.  It pulls you in with quirky, charismatic characters and a plot with many twists (which could be said for many series, I know).  There is always something interesting happening and I have never found it boring. As they develop each of the characters, it makes for great storytelling with bits of humor thrown in to balance the drama. Many times situations look one way, but then things come to light which completely turn things on their head so it isn't predictable.  I do recommend watching the movie Dead Apple a couple of times, to catch things you may have missed in the first watching...as well as making the storyline a bit more clear.  At least that was my experience. I also read the Manga version.  Overall, I definitely recommend the series.",5
bungo-stray-dogs,"The art, the music, the atmosphere, the jokes and every little detail what this series has is a masterpiece for my soul.I remember when I started to watch it most of the abilities were a little bit odd for me, but after a few episodes everything just made sense by itself. How the story and the relationships work is mind-blowing!!! The fighting and the life lessons what it has still makes a huge impact on me. Yes, yes maybe I'm a little bit overreacting, but honestly, since I finished the season three it's hard to get as much involved into an anime as I was into this. My soul trembling and suffering because it wants more.Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideAnd last but not least...Dazai and Chuuya relationship is a gold ticket for me! I just love them!!",5
bungo-stray-dogs,"OOOOMMMMMGGGG Latest episode AHHHHHHHHBut in all seriousness...If you like mystery, action, cool character please check out Bungo Stray dogs. As a fan from 2017 ( pretty late, yeah I know) it didn`t bore me out. Usually, after watching an average quality or not very populated anime you wouldn`t stick with it. Yet with season 3 coming out in April 2019, it was worth the wait. With memorable moments from the manga shown in season 3, who wouldn`t watch it. I highly recommend giving this anime a try, if you like a not big fandom, detectives/mafia anime with a dose of magical abilities and a whole load of charcter`s personal problems.",4.5
bungo-stray-dogs,"Let me just say that with how well this show is, it is surprisingly underrated. I remember dropping this anime on the on the first few eps when the first season was out but I'm glad I did because I just binged it all to the very recent episode of season 3 in a week. Season 1 does start off pretty slow but give it a chance. The more you watch the more action packed it gets plus the character development makes each of them important. The momentum keeps up in season 3, can't wait to see whats next.",4.5
bungo-stray-dogs,"I would take a bullet for Nakahara Chuuya, no questions asked.No, okay, all jokes aside, this is my favorite anime of all time, and this is coming from someone who has watched anime consistently for over a decade. I cannot even begin to describe how wonderful and multi-faceted all of the characters in Bungo Stray Dogs are. There are twists you don't see coming and, even being caught up on the manga, I still have no idea what's about to happen. The show is equal parts hilarious comedy, sinister adventure, and incredible fight scenes. I really struggled to like some characters at first (not naming names (Atsushi)) but have since pulled a 180 due to the amazing storytelling. I'm serious; this is a must-watch. I will be cosplaying from this show until the end of time. Words cannot explain how good it is.",5
bungo-stray-dogs,"When I first started watching, I was hoping this anime would fall under some of my most beloved classics. It seemed to have a similar feel at first to some of my more casual favorites but it didn't sadly. I will be honest, I don't think it had anything to do with the story or most of the characters, but more just personal interest. Some of the actions by two specific ""sibling"" characters hit my moral compass in all the wrong areas, I couldn't tolerate them at all because it was just so over the top at times.Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hide I do not recommend for anyone triggered by Incest or Public Sexual actions/displays/suggestions. And I mean this genuinely for people with actual triggers, not people simply offended by this.  I feel the story itself lacked something, I'm not sure what. Perhaps it was the pacing but it just didn't grab me. It seemed all to casual. I'm also a bit bothered with how much many of the characters looked like remakes of characters from Black Butler.",5
bungo-stray-dogs,"I wanna start this off, I love how they named the characters after Japanese authors, and their abilities after the books they've written. It's really a good idea and I would 10/10 buy the books that they wrote.I remember starting this show back in... 2018. I only watched the first episode and didn't even finish the first season. It wasn't until this year, after I met my girlfriend, we binged watched all seasons, including the movie. It's a really amazing anime, and all the characters are amazing too - even the bad guys. (Except Fyodor, forget him.)My favorite character from this is Chuuya Nakahara. I relate to him in a way; especially being short. XD Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideSpoiler warning: Chuuya's still trapped in the book at the end of season 3 but yes, I know he makes it out and returns in the manga, and makes an epic entrance with a helicopter. Can't wait to see that animated. Overall, I highly recommend this anime; even for beginners.",5
bungo-stray-dogs,"Like many anime I make the mistake of reading the synopsis before watching them and I need to stop doing that. This was a fun and interesting anime from the start until the finish. If there is more I'll be sure to watch it then. Blah Blah Blah you get it. People have written enough about it I'm sure you'll get the picture. If you want something that takes up time but doesn't feel like poop when you're done I think this should do it, if not more!",5
bungo-stray-dogs,"I love this anime for many reasons. One being the action, one being the characters, one being the story, and one being the way they characters are developed as are their relationships with one another. This anime does character development really well, they also do progression with relationships in a way this is heartfelt and makes you invested in the relationship. Even if you don't necessarily like the character (as I didn't like some to begin with) you still get invested and drawn in watching their stories unfold and learn to understand them. The action is also done really well too, like the main character doesn't level up right away. He has to learn and battle and lose and get better, he just doesn't suddenly become good and amazing at fighting all of the sudden. Anyway, I think y'all should watch it.",5
bungo-stray-dogs,"If I could sum up this show, it would be shallow but fun.  As long as you can ignore the Marty Stus and the stupider then they think characters and ideas in the show, then its easy to find this enjoyable.  The action is fast paced, the comedy is enjoyable, characters are mostly well-written with one glaring exception, and the visuals are pleasant.  That said, for a more detailed breakdown of its problems, see below.For a work based on great literature, there is precious little development given to the ideas espoused by its inspirations.  Merely speaking a few words of supposed wisdom are not enough to actually demonstrate why its considered wisdom.  The show never bothers to explore anything it says, as if somehow just mentioning an idea is enough.  This is not to say the works it references are poor or stupid, but the viewer can't tell because the show itself doesn't do anything smart with them.  The literature referenced is considered great because it EARNS those lofty ideas through demonstration again and again of its themes.  The show certainly doesn't earn anything with its focus is on main characters, who while occasionally clever, more often then not just get what they want because they happen to be the main characters.The worst example of this by far is Dazai, who is supposed to be a legendary figure in the city they inhabit with a high level of intelligence.  Yet he does incredibly stupid things that only due to plot armor, 'cool' factor, or comedy allow him to survive.  If you walk to an enemy base, alone, and are surrounded by people with guns, and you have no supernatural ability to deal with bullets, you are going to die, period.  Even with another team member's ability to cure fatal injuries, they still have to be physically present and it takes time, and Dazai would be in tiny little bits, or shot repeatedly in the brain.  At some point it becomes too much to take because no one important in this show is in any serious risk at all, unless the author obviously wants a 'tragic' death.Another example is that any intelligent enemy would target the vulnerable members first with bullets, then kill everyone else.  Yet everybody in this show is too busy stopping to talk while giving precious time for the enemy to arrive before they actually try to kill anyone, and this happens OVER AND OVER AND OVER again.  All while this is happening you have characters making poses and exchanging one liners while we're supposed to believe this show is actually intelligent from its pedigree.  If there is a chance a fight might be nearly impossible to win without actual casualties among the protagonists, expect the show to cut away and NOT show how in the world the enemy was defeated without some of those bullets cutting down vulnerable members.At its core Bungo Stray Dogs is above average action show with some good ideas for abilities and characters.  It also has the greatest anime Great Gatsby villain I have ever seen.  I'd just like the show more if it stopped pretending to be anywhere smart enough to be referencing great works of literature and instead accepted its place as dumb fun for everyone.",5
bungo-stray-dogs,"I am surprised this was tagged for seinen. Do you need a super obvious main character that lacks originality? Low self worth, check, no family, check, guilt inducing life circumstance, seems to lack spine but is self-sacrificing, check. All the low tide markers for young boys to think it's coollllllll. I've seen it referred to as ""comedy but then it get's ""Real Dark"""" you mean ham-handed mob references of ""bad dudes""*tm? Nothing about ""super bad bad guy that is bad and kills people!"" is real darkness. Bad guys speeches are stupid, and the power activation is really slow. You could walk up to them and smack them across the face before they get done verbally announcing their powers. Plot is so cut a paste cookie cutter trope that it makes me want to gag. The bad guy isn't convincing or motivating. The dialog is super clumsy, badly repeating. Hope you like being beat over the head with the same ""bad past flash back"" 10 million times in the first 5 episodes alone. There is no tension or intrigue, and it's like watching people over act very poorly. Only good thing it has is the comedic animation, the faces and timing is well done. This is not for someone with a older taste for refined plot. Super disappointed, so many people raved about this and it is just so stupid and cheesy.",5
bungo-stray-dogs,"The characters are very interesting and well crafted. However the biggest issue is the story and direction is a bit of a jumble and some scenes could have used more work  Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hidethere was one scene where a character that was shown several times gets shot and I'm guessing dies, but since none of the other characters really reacted to him getting shot and he's never shown or spoken about again I'm left guessing  . They also have a problem starting up an interesting problem or character conflict then just suddenly switch gears to a different problem without resolving original conflicts in fact they flat out never address what happens to some enemy charactersSpoiler Alert! Click to show or hide they capture and run off to do other stuff.I'm honestly only sticking thru because some of the characters really pull their weight interest wise, although the writer does play favoritism for specific characters (especially Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideDazai and Ranpo both who I find to be too childish of characters ) Honestly never read the manga but I'm considering dropping the anime to try it and see if it is maybe less erratic.",5
bungo-stray-dogs,"Don't know why i didn't give this show a chance.Back when i didn't have premium this is the show that was advertised the most to me, so back in 2016. I finally started watching it because it's made by the glorious studio Bones and holy hell was it worth it. Comedy, characters, animation, songs all stick to you because they're all unique and different in their own way (Dazai for example xd)The music kind of sticked to me the most, especially the OP of S2 and some of the fight scenes.",5
bungo-stray-dogs,"A set of high-fashion character designs move dryly through an underworld tinged with the occasional supernatural power in this piece that just didn't work for me. I couldn't care less about anyone here, didn't find the fight scenes suspenseful, and after a full season couldn't detect the hint of a theme or point to the whole thing other than, we've got drawings and a budget, might as well pump this out. Attractive and competent I guess, but not bothering to get into the second season.",5
bungo-stray-dogs,"(Solo vi hasta la 1er Temporada)Bungou Stray Dogs es una serie de acción con ligeros tintes detectivesco y sobre natural.Trama La historia gira en torno a Atsushi un chico que fue expulsado de su orfanato porque su presencia traía desgracia al lugar. Despues de un rato se topa con unos detectives y descubre que el como los detectives tienen habilidades sobrenaturales. Estos lo invitan a unirse y pelear contra las fuerzas de la mafia. Aunque la trama no esta mal realmente, tampoco es del todo original y tiene tendencias enormes al fanservice. El principal ofensor es la inconsistencia del ritmo en la serie, es una serie que busca que la tomen en serie en muchas ocasiones pero traicionandose a si misma rompe ese ritmo y pone un humor completamente ridiculo (y no en un sentido muy disfrutabable). Arte/Animación El diseño de los personajes es un general bastante variado y bien realizado, eso algo a remarcarse, aun mas con la animación no quedándose a tras. Las peleas aunque generalmente sin mucha fuerza siempre están muy bien animadas,Musica La musica de la serie no me hace recordar ni un momento en especifico, así que puedo decir que no es muy impresionante. El opening estate bien animal pero no crew sea visualmente interesante al memos para mi. El ending simplemente no tango mucho que decir de el ya que no sucede mucho. Resumen Bungou Stray Dogs es una serie que probablemente no era para mi para empezar. Aun así no puedo evitar darme cuenta de lo mal que es el tono de la serie, como si fuera una crisis de identidad no me logra atrapar e ninguna forma. En lo particular no la recomendaría a menos que te gusten las series con mucho ""shipping potential"". Le doy un 4.0/10",4.5
bungo-stray-dogs,"Note: This review is based off of the first two seasons of Bungo Stray Dogs.Similarly to Noragami and Chaika-The Coffin Princess, I watched this show because of Studio BONES. Studio BONES is one of my favorite anime studios, so I trust them enough to at least try to watch some of their works. Bungo Stray Dogs is yet another excellent work by BONES.First, what this show does right. The characters are definitely the strong suit of this show. People like Kyouka and Dazai are really interesting and fun to watch. They are developed really well and their interactions are interesting and fun. The animation is incredibly well done.  Motions feel fluid and realistic. Fight scenes are blood-pumping and action packed. The potential is available. The power system is incredibly unique and original. The OP is also well done. It's entertaining to watch and listen to. The story is strong and well developed. I only have one problem with the show. That problem is the pacing. The pacing can be all over the place. Sometimes the story moves slowly then picks up speed quickly only to come to a sudden break. This improves in the second season, but still needs some tweaking. Overall, this is an excellent watch definitely worth the time to watch it. The only problem is the pacing, but if you can overlook that, the show is great. I am excited to see what will happen to this show in the future. I recommend this show to anyone who is interested in watching it.Overall Rating: 9/10",4.5
bungo-stray-dogs,"I loved this show when I started it.  The art is really interesting, the interaction of the characters powers is really cool, the ""teams"" so to speak are interesting.  But as the show goes on, it becomes more and more contrived.  Every plot point or twist is painfully predictable or forced in order to progress 'poetic' relationships or interactions between the characters.  This is NOT helped by the fact that death is irrelevant to the main cast, because [LIGHT SPOILER] they have a person in their group that can basically bring anyone back from death.  And even that power is overwrought: it works or doesn't only depending on how 'exciting' it will make the scene or that part of the story.Season 2 is abysmal.  It's like watching proto-dialogue for 24 episodes; it feels like the writers outlined how they wanted the dialogue to go and then never actually WROTE the dialogue, so the characters just BARF out their motivations and what they're thinking.  This in opposition to actual dialogue where you can glean their thoughts indirectly from the dialogue.It's just lazy.  And when the finale fight is a classic ""anime laser beams"" fight I just said ""I'm out.""  Good god.",5
bungo-stray-dogs,"5 star rating cant compensate this value of this masterpiece if you dont watch it well its your loss lolI don't even know where to begin with this anime. It's incredibly off beat and certainly doing its own thing, and to be frank, there's really nothing like it on Crunchy Roll. The visual style, production values and overall timing of the show are nothing short of spectacular. I really don't need to make this review very long because if you're tired of seeing high school stories and want something more mature but not heavy handed, this anime is for you, and it's bound to be a classic amongst the likes of Cowboy Bebop. No joke, this could be the next big mature anime series, so get in on the ground floor for this. If the first 5 minutes turn you off, DON'T STOP WATCHING. You'll be thrown for a loop in a hurry. Join a misfit band of superpowered detectives solving cases against other supers who dress like it's the 19th century using abilities that are unique and interesting. Sure, the mature lead has an ability most of us are familiar with, but don't think for a second that this series is even remotely like Charlotte. This is its own thing, set in a Victorian-but-modern city dripping with awesome style, goregous animation and quick wit. The only thing that I'm afraid of in this series is that it'll be short lived LIKE Charlotte because of how expensive it must be to produce... but if the end credit sequence is anything to go by, I think we could be in for a good 24 episodes in this season at least. That's it. Just watch it, and be hopeful they don't go back on their promise for a second--or maybe third--season.",5
bungo-stray-dogs,"Honestly one of my top favorite anime's.  It's been out for quite some time but has only recently risen up to the surface and from what I know, the writer of the manga is still extending.  This is a series you will want to be lengthy because you just cant get enough of these characters and there are so many with their own background stories that make them so easy to connect with, including the villains.Bungo Stray Dogs is not our average Crime Anime. The real mystery is what surrounds the groups of highly gifted individuals and it's still difficult to figure out where the plot is actually leading too but that's what makes you want more!Oh! I usually dont like the main character as my fav... but.. <3 You are just going to have to watch this so I don't spoil anything. Enjoy!",4
bungo-stray-dogs,"I'm hooked. This show is fundamentally different from other shows yet so entertaining. It has basically everything I look for in anime - light humor, dark humor, beautiful action scenes, and motifs unique to the anime. Every character is its own individual, and you start to feel a blur between good and evil more and more as you watch. I fell in love with this show that constantly battles the meaning of life in both a comedic and heavy way. I thin this show tries to explain to the audience that we don't go through life in a straight line, the course that we want to. We go through hardships we would never expect, as we always expect and wish for what we can't obtain. The stories told by all individuals were so captivating, deep, and beautiful. Love this show with all my heart now, hope you guys can appreciate this series too!",3
bungo-stray-dogs,"Atsushi Nakajima, an orphan kicked to the curb encounters an eccentric suicidal man by the name of Osamu Dazai. As a thank you for saving Dazai from one of his many suicide attempts, he offers to help Atsushi with his troubles. Dazai happens to be a member of the supernatural detective agency, and decides to assist Atsushi in a problem involving a mysterious ""tiger"" terrorizing him. With the help of Dazai and his detective partner Doppo Kunikida, they solve the mystery, but it leaves Atsushi in a rock and a hard place. Atsushi is then coerced into joining their firm of supernatural investigators. Without an alternative for his future, Atsushi now begins his work to solve unusual cases and fend off against malicious organizations in the city of Yokohama.If I were to shorten my description of the anime, I would call it an incredibly grounded Blood Blockade Battlefront. To those that don't know what that means, here's your version. Bungou Stray Dogs is a supernatural, super power action comedy, with a good vs. bad story. The anime's biggest strength hands down is the various abilities and fight scenes, other than that it does boast a sizable cast of good characters. All having their own reasons for doing what they do, regardless of what side they're on though, all of them love their city, doing whatever they can to protect and nurture it. a fun watch I can easily recommend. Bonus points to Crunchyroll for also managing to snag the Bungou Stray Dogs movie Dead Apple for us.Season 3 edit:OK, season three of Bungou Stray Dogs was fantastic! It gives a lot more growth and small development between our characters, and the second half's major events were freaking awesome! The season three payoff alone is absolutely worth watching the entire series! Any opinion I might of had previously about wanting a little bit more from this anime has been completely defenestrated, and I can now wholly recommend this to any action anime fan!",5
bungo-stray-dogs,"The first season of Bungo Stray Dogs is charming and silly.  Then slowly towards the end of season one and the beginning of season two a lot of deep and somber undertones came out.  That where always there to begin with. No longer was Bungo Stray Dogs this charming silly comedic relief anime that I had thought it to be.  It was this dramatic symphony that really that really made hit me hard and made me cry. It really made me think that your friends should never be taken for granted and that there really isn't a fine line between good and evil, but that good was simply a little bit better because among helping yourself you are helping other people in the process.  If you have not watched Bungo Stray Dogs I strongly recommend doing so.  ( Plus the art style is beautiful and the character designs are really unique)",5
bungo-stray-dogs,"This show did not disappoint. The concept of using popular author names from both Japan and the west(but mostly America) was unique, interesting, and it felt so gratifying when you knew or recognized one of the authors. It was humorous when it needed to be, but it didn't let that take away from the anime being action packed with some dark undertones. My only complaint with this show was that it was not longer!. I was captivated by the action, the plot, and the very concepts. Even the side characters were reasonably fleshed out. This leads me to my other point. Characters. The main cast was really well done, from character design to backstory. The main character felt like someone we could sympathize with, while also being someone we could back in a fight. The supporting characters where quirky and wonderful, causing laughs and providing comic relief, but not being intrusive in the storyline. The anime also knew when it was time to properly flesh out characters, taking away the reins from the main character and the storyline. This was probably the shows equivalent to filler, yet it wasn't boring or plentiful, and added to the plot directly or indirectly.Overall, Bungo Stray Dogs was an anime that I do not regret watching, and would recommend to anyone who is a fan of their action anime",5
bungo-stray-dogs,"I was recommended this one by a friend, and trustworthy one at that, so I knew this would good and I wasn't disappointed in the slightest. This show's not only action-packed , but is also pretty humorous and creative, which I wasn't expecting. The concept of basing characters off of not only famous Japanese authors, but American ones as well and all their powers are based on their most famous works is awesome to me. Hell, the creativity and passion on this one practically flows out the screen and onto my bedroom floor. It actually somewhat reminded me of Noragami as well, especially in the action department. My one complaint would that I feel like the concept itself can more interesting than the actual plot in some places, which is why it's only a four for me.Overall, I highly recommend this one especially if you like action, comedy, or you're a major bookworm",5
bungo-stray-dogs,"I have to say, it took me some time to finish Bungo Stray Dogs but it definitely was worth the time. An interesting series nonetheless. What turned me off this time around was the ""weightless"" battles. Yes.. even to my surprise this series fell on the same old trap. I really had high expectations as the series appeared mature from the beginning. It was really funny to see how many characters didn't die in the series. For me part of a great battle are the stakes. Unfortunately in Bungo Stray Dogs the battles were magnificent, with evolving powers, powerful enemies and cunning schemes only to be brought down by the shallow aftermaths. Battles aside, this show had very nice artwork and interesting music and BGMs. The characters were satisfyingly developed but for the mature audience, a lot of questions arose as the series progressed. This was mainly due to the way the show projected new strong characters all the time while undermining the main characters. The scenario wasn't too much of a mystery in contradiction with mainstream tantei stories but then again it was humorous and light as well. I can't really offer a definite answer for its value but let's just say it is up to personal preference. Speaking of values, in the ending of the series values and beliefs were the main ""engine"" behind those final battles. The ending was good enough with clear indicators pointing to a second installment in the series.I have to say, the series was a black sheep for me. Not in a bad way though. It had a unique style that as many other reviewers said many enjoyed and liked dearly. As for me, i think Bungo Stray Dogs was really entertaining in it's own way. Unmistakably a great series to watch.",5
bungo-stray-dogs,"I didn't really care for some characters but overall anime was very unique and unpredictable. I loved the ending (episode 24) and the amazing individuals who grew into something even better, good and evil unite. I think I am just a sucker for awesome villains and great plot twists, this anime gave me everything I ever wanted; action, creative character design, plot twists, and the epic end battle and a happy ending.",5
bungo-stray-dogs,"Judging from the first episode, this series was NOT what I was expecting. However, I decided to give it a chance and man I am glad I did. The story is quirky, fun, dramatic, comedic, and so much more. The character development is captivating and a joy to watch. This series will make you laugh, cry, and, beg for more. The creative writers and directors for this show should be considered ""Genius"", as they have incorporated the personality traits of the real authors and poets that the characters are named after. The imaginative play on words and comedic references to the ""literary masters"" is both imaginative and educating of the Japanese culture. Need I say more? Definitely check this anime out if you get the chance. You won't regret it!",4.5
bungo-stray-dogs,"Great Show; but I wish it were longer. Had some great characters, but they didn't push some of them to their fullest abilities (namely Dazai, the Detective boss, and other enemy characters). Moreover the Dazai backstory was a little to abrupt, but added some very good flavor and feels to the show. Overall, great fight scenes, solid story and character development, plus the leads weren't super overpowered--except for Dazai.If you have a weekend where you want to binge a interesting anime, this is the ticket. It'll leave you wanting MORE...",4.5
bungo-stray-dogs,"Do you like classic lit? Do you like clever character design? Do you want to watch a show about super-powered detectives fighting super-powered mobsters, all of whom are based on authors and novels of literary merit?WELL THEN DO WE HAVE THE SHOW FOR YOU!Bungo Stray Dogs is a multi-layered, tear-jerking, visually stunning story following a lovable underdog character and his wayward mentor as they harness amazingly creative superpowers (like creating your own dimension and turning into a human fursona) to fight engaging and unsettling villains. Characters as good as this gang don't come around every season so definitely give this show a chance if you want a relatable and lovable cast that not many shows can give you/",5
bungo-stray-dogs,"I will say that this anime is fantastic. The best four episodes in anime are the second seasons first four episodes. I haven't seen something that good in quite a while. Not much else to say other than my direction at the audience. To those reviewing this anime and don't like Dazai's suicide thing, because you don't get it, perhaps look up his name...and the fact that most of the characters are based on authors or their works, maybe then you could POSSIBLY understand what it means when Dazai wants to commit suicide...oh heck...ill ruin it for you...DAZAI a real WRITER...killed himself after much thinking of what would be the best choice to do so...he walked into a canal and drown along with his 'lover.' which if you watched the show more than 5 episodes gives many allusions to the canal and his suicide which seems to bother people. THERE MYSTIQUE AND RESEARCH COMPLETE now enjoy the show after looking things up...or doing your own research btw the second season might give this mystique away after you realize all the bad guys are molded after foreign authors including the main bad guy............F Scott Fitzgerald.",5
bungo-stray-dogs,"...naaaanchatte! I have many words! But I'll keep it short.This show, I wasn't so sure about it just from the cover and the summary. It seemed like a historical thing, which I don't like, and idk I was just hesitant going in.However, this show has completely blown away my expectations coming in, and the expectations that continued to build from there. First of all, the art just knocks you out from the get go. It's beautiful, it's powerful, and it makes everything feel sharp and in-focus (if that makes sense). And most importantly, it doesn't hurt to binge watch it! Some shows make it hard to continue watching over a long period of time, this isn't one of them. Then, the characters, so wonderfully fleshed out and human. And the fact that they're named after famous and influential and renowned writers? Cherry on top. I still can't figure out where Lovecraft was from, and I feel like it's cheating to look it up! I am also quite partial to F.S. Fitzgerald, Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideand I hated that I didn't like him and didn't know his motivations until the end. However, when he did reveal them, I hated that I couldn't really hate him anymore. I also hated that I didn't understand how acquiring the weretiger and that book would somehow bring his daughter back, but I'm hopeful that we'll get an explanation in season 3.  Continuing on... Season 2 really is just a pack of feels hand-delivered to your tear glands, IMO. At least, the first third(?) is. Ahhh, storyline was brilliant. I'm very good at deducing plot points, character actions, and generally being able to determine after a few minutes where a scene or storyline will go, but there were some moments where I was truly completely taken aback by the turn of events, which is much appreciated.The action was amazing, with the art the effect is just wonderful and exciting. It was also well-paced and not there just for the sake of it. Every little bit felt important (and not just the action). Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideEven when I was wondering why they lingered on the Kyouka storyline when I thought they had exhausted it, they managed to surprise me with where they took it. So I took a breather while writing this, and came to the decision that the plot, characters, art, story, literally everything, were so perfect and complex that you should just watch it yourself.",5
bungo-stray-dogs,"Well this is one odd duck. Keep in mind I've been actively avoiding long running, convoluted, crowded cast shonen anime. And yet I still fall face first into them. Oh well, at least this one is good. But weird.First: this cast is huge. Only 2 seasons exist so far and there's a large group of ""heroes"" and larger group of antagonists, a third group of IDK-what-they-are's and many side tangential characters. Bring you notebook to keep track. Thankfully the designs are really distinct from one and other. Also they somehow managed to give enough time to most of the characters that you at least get a sense of depth if not a full arc.Speaking of characters, their powers are really cool and completely bananas. I won't spoil any specifics (seeing it yourself is too much fun). But it makes for a lot of great action. The animation is more than up to the task. Now the conceit of these characters is where things get weird. They are all named after authors. Most of the Japanese characters also ""look"" and ""act"" like those authors. I use quotes because the looks are updated to the modern day. For example, the farmer guys look like they came from today's countrysides. As for acting, folks with more literally experience will tell you they often act like what the authors wrote more than what the authors did in life themselves. You can see ANN's reviews for more details on that front. What's really fun as an American is that the foreigners are like ~characters~ from their namesakes' works. So ""Herman M"" look like Captain Ahab.~~Trigger Warning: Suicide~~Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hidePart of being based on past authors is that some of the authors had issues that show up in their characters. In particular is a main character, Dazai, who fantasizes about suicide. This is difficult because the real Dazai Osamu attempted suicide several times before succeeding at age 38. The character Dazai ""attempts"" suicide a few times in earlier episodes. Thankfully this trails off eventually. And we start to see story reasons for this behavior that makes things more sad but less gimmicky.~~End Trigger Warning~~All in all as long running, convoluted, crowded cast shonen anime go, this one is better than most. It's not that long (yet) and while complicated, you can follow what's going on. There are a lot of characters, but they are worth watching. And while the action follows the shonen trope of being crazy space bananas pants over the top, its wonderfully drawn. And there is (usually) a reason behind it. It's a pretty good way to spend 24 episodes. While much of the story closes are the end, there is so much room for more afterward.",5
bungo-stray-dogs,"i was hooked at the first episode. everything about this anime. the humor, the tragedy, the character development, the art, the story. it's just wonderful. i only wish there were more episodes so i could binge even more. honestly dazai is an amazing and creative character. turning something like suicide into such a lighthearted and comical thing was unexpected and certainly unique. this anime felt new. original.",3
bungo-stray-dogs,"At the time of writing this review, I've watched the entirety of both seasons 7 times. If I were you, I would start watching it before you even finish reading this review. You can even start right now. You won't regret it.This show has everything you could want: talented voice acting, a pleasing and somewhat unique art style, an entire cast of interesting characters, a plot that goes from zero to 100 and doesn't stop drawing you in, a pace that isn't too slow or too fast, and a unique theme.  Every character is named after a real-life author and abilities/superpowers are named after their most famous work.  However, just because you know the name of the ability, doesn't mean you know what it does (which I appreciate).  The characters are not just the namesakes, but also embody other characteristics of the authors (the manner varies: it could be their personality, interests, fashion sense, writing style, etc). It's very clear that each character was designed carefully, with a lot of thought.  The show is incredibly creative and somewhat more mature than many currently popular shows.  It is a genre mix of supernatural, comedy, dark, and action.If you like this anime, I highly recommend reading the manga as well (from the beginning, because if you skip to where the anime ends, you miss character backstories and all the moments the anime did not include), as well as the official parody manga, BSD wan.",1
bungo-stray-dogs,I was skeptical at first getting into it and wasn't sure if I really wanted to get into it because it seemed weird? For lack of a better term. But I'm so glad that I gave it a chance and I'm so glad that I can recommend this anime to others. It's a show that's done very nicely and it's funny in a dark way. The first couple episodes of season 2 were my favorite. It is one of those animes where I believe that the secondary characters are much more likable than the main character. It is one that you have to keep watching for it to make more sense. I want more seasons of this one for sure!,2
bungo-stray-dogs,"Bungou Stray Dogs has everything you could ever ask for; Great animation, a wide variety of distinguished characters, and ever changing story line, plot twists galore, and enough action and mystery to keep you hooked. (The only thing missing is a musical number and a hot springs episode but we'll have to make due.) If you're looking for a new anime, look no further. Personally, my favorite thing about this anime is the fact that its characters are each named/based off the works of an author.",5
bungo-stray-dogs,"It took me awhile to finish watching the second season to give it a proper review. I liked the first season better. I watched the second season a little confused at the beginning, thinking that I missed key elements to the show. I had not.The story and it being a supernatural sort of show is definitely something I like. It had a fair amount of action and a fairly good plot to go with it. I would recommend watching this if you are just interested in a show that fits the criteria that I had mentioned above.",5
bungo-stray-dogs,"This anime is pretty good, but before I watched it, I read all the reviews and boy did they really hype up this show. Finishing season 1 all I want to say is don't read the reviews other than this, the anime itself is great all around, but people hyped it up wayyyy too much. I don't want people to fall into the same trap of reading 'OMG THIS ANIME IS THE BEST EVER' or 'WATCH THIS OR YOU'LL REGRET IT' or even 'IF YOU DO ANYHTING, MAKE SURE YOU WATCH THIS AMAZING ANIME' with everything being '10/10' and 'ITS MY FAV ANIME EVER'I fell into this trap and post season 1, I was kind of let down seeing as i've watched a whole bunch of Anime's and coming out of them pleased, satisfied and feeling accomplished, only to read reviews saying that it wasn't that good. Then I go to read reviews for this and think, 'damn, this must be amazing' only to see that its just like the others that I've watch and enjoyed.Sorry to be a buzzkill if you've read up to the end, but I think by now you get the point. Don't fall into the hype, IMO its always best to go into an anime with a nuetral mindset excluding the hype of others.",5
bungo-stray-dogs,"i have heard quite a bit about this anime and well, i wasn't disappointed. this anime delivered on the hype, even though i follows the time and true method, i still like how this story progressed and how even the supporting characters continued to play major roles throughout the series. such a well written and funny at times at just the right tempo and times, while also keeping a natural flow between the episodes. binge watch worthy for sure, i couldn't really stop after one episode either, just felt that good and had to watch more.",4.5
bungo-stray-dogs,"The art was great, the character arcs were great, the messages were great, the literary theme was great, and this show actually made me cry, which is difficult for an anime to do. (So many anime have tried to make me cry over the years that I've kinda become immune.)My one complaint is that at times the writing for individual episodes could be a little bit lazy. The episode with Rompo vs. Poe felt a little on the ridiculous side to me (and at first it had me super excited too... ;~; )But, other than that, I would definitely rate it among my top favorite anime. I will be buying the manga if I ever get the chance, and waiting in anticipation for a potential season 3. o(>v<)o",4.5
bungo-stray-dogs,"It took a couple of episodes for this one to really sink in but everything worked in it.   Once the premise was set they used the world they built to tell a solid story that felt similar to other anime I have seen before but just had better writing, better production, better characters, and overall better execution than the rest.  The first season is strong but the second season is where the show really takes off.",5
bungo-stray-dogs,"I originally heard of Bungo Stray Dogs last year, right before the anime came out. Although the title intrigued me, I was even more interested when I learned that the characters were based off of authors! I read through the manga all too quickly, and after watching the anime I only have more praise.The manga itself is incredible, and the anime does it justice! I was slightly worried about the adaption, but everything was kept extremely accurate, and the extra episodes are done in good taste and fit in well with the original plot. Not only is the story great, but the voice acting is perfect. The music is some of the best I've heard from a lot of shows recently; it really fits with and contributes to the overall feel of the show. It has been so much fun watching the characters come to life.Bungo Stray Dogs has the perfect balance of intensity, humor, and action. It satisfies all my anime cravings with lovable heroes(and villains), great atmosphere, creative abilities, and fantastic fight scenes. It deserves all the popularity it's getting and I'm so proud of how far it's come!And yes, I'm going to be  that person and say it: I liked Bungo Stray Dogs before it was cool.You won't regret watching this show!",2
bungo-stray-dogs,"Ok, kids. I have been watching anime for a while, since the original Astro Boy in the 60's (shows my age, lol). I've done all of One Piece, Bleach, Naruto, Cowboy Bebop, Space Dandy, Gate, Sword Art Online...you name it (except for the sports ones, just don't get it). This is, by far, one of the best out there. Fantastic characters, story line....the animation is just freaking....freaking....damn....beautiful. It really is.If you don't watch this, than you are truly missing out. Don't. Miss. Out.",2
bungo-stray-dogs,"I really appreciate this anime because of its unique characters.  Each character manages to feel real; characters develop at a steady pace, without becoming stronger overnight or being weak/wimpy forever either.  The animation is beautiful, and I find the literary references amusing.  Additionally, the plot is complex enough to be extremely engaging, yet not so overly complicated as to lose the viewer in excessive twists and turns.",5
bungo-stray-dogs,"From the beginning to the end, this anime kept you invested all the way through. With the beautiful animation, and great story- it would be hard not to continue watching. The chemistry between the characters, enemies and allies, were exceptional. I loved how it wasn't completely black and white, everyone had a reason of doing what they were doing, they were all their own people- not just bad guys and good guys. Not only did it make me cry because of tragedy, but it also made me cry because of happiness. The only complaint I have is that the ending suggested a third season and there's no third season.",2
toradora,"If you’re a seasoned anime fan, you’ll have encountered innumerable entries to the ‘high school rom-com’ genre. Many are cheap and sloppy, full of two dimensional characters and hollow drama. There’s little satisfaction to be had watching socially awkward teens dance around their emo feelings for 12-24 episodes without providing any meaningful closure. But don’t despair, because Toradora! is here to restore our faith in anime, humanity, and true love stories.First let’s talk comedy. Toradora! has it in spades. Over-the-top slapstick, snarky repartee, ridiculous reactions and visual gags are all out in force and hit you when you least expect. While the second half of the show changes focus to drama and romance over the heavy comedy of the first half, there are still great laughs to be had in nearly every episode. To this day, “Smells…like…MILK!” never fails to wreck my friends with laughter. Bravo.Still, the true worth of a rom-com is in its romance. Jokes are simpler to write than the journey between two characters falling in love in a way that resonates true with viewers. In my opinion, most high school romance anime never involves actual love at all. Typically it’s just children wallowing in various stages of infatuation and obsession, yet too afraid to act on those feelings. However, Toradora! sets the bar higher yet again with characters who confess their feelings and noticeably mature over the course of the show. The emotions they convey carry vastly more weight as viewers can relate to these well-rounded and evolving characters.Yet I reserve my highest praise for Toradora!’s presentation of true love.  As I said before, ‘love’ in this genre is better labeled as infatuation. Even within Toradora! most of the romantic relationships follow that formula. However, the primary romance (beware vague spoilers ahead) is actually based on genuine love. These characters accept each other as they are instead of placing one another on pedestals. They value the other’s well-being over their own as if it’s the most natural thing in the world. With that honest love established as the basis of their relationship, the emotional payoff of their romance satisfies to the core of one’s soul.Of course, no show is perfect, and Toradora! has faults that need be addressed for this to be a balanced review and not the drool spattered ravings of a fan-boy. Especially glaring problems are a couple of events which transpired in the last two episodes. Unavoidable spoilers ahead.Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideFirst, Taiga and Ryuji’s decision to elope makes no rational sense, even for teenagers. There was no threat that warranted running away from. They seemed afraid their parents would separate them and force life choices they didn’t want. However, there was no proof this was the case. They never talked to their parents even once to express their love for each other or big life choices. If they had, and the parents had been against it, then running away makes perfect sense. However, without any real threat, the choice becomes a contrived decision by the writers to add more drama for the sake of shock value.Secondly, Taiga’s choice to leave without a word to Ryuji at the end of the last episode is 100% the writers screwing with the audience. The character of Taiga we’ve come to know would never make the choice in a vacuum. Again it’s just more forced drama to shock viewers that makes no sense at all.Sorry about that for those who haven’t seen the anime yet. The short version is the writers make several decisions purely to shock viewers, but these choices make no sense and don’t have any real impact on the story.  Just cheap drama for the sake of drama. Both problems could have been avoided if these plot points weren't rushed into the final two episodes but instead had time to develop properly.My other serious issue regards the three main characters who don’t end up in the final romance. They are all written to be sympathetic and relatable, and you can’t help but root for them. However, they are given absolutely no attention in the closing episodes of the show. Happy ending or bittersweet, there is nothing done to hint at their lives after high school. After spending 25 episodes with these characters, I felt a hollow ache in my gut all day after finishing the last episode. I needed a final chapter to their stories, but the writers simply ignore them. It was a huge missed opportunity and keeps the show from having a completely satisfying ending.When all is said and done, though, Toradora! is an outstanding anime, delivering almost everything you want from this genre. Each episode relentlessly attacks with the laughs and the feels and, most amazingly, tells a real love story. Toradora! ranks up there with the very best rom-com anime, and absolutely deserves your time.",5
toradora,"Characters: 5/5Story: 5/5Animation: 5/5Ending: 4/5Flow: 5/5Overall: 5/5How can one start about Toradora? Looking from the perspective of an outsider, there is nothing truly different about this show than the hundreds of other romance anime's that have been seen already. However, my opinion quickly changed upon watching the first couple of episodes, and turned into a deep obsession by the end of the show. There are just so many things that Toradora has correct, it is easy to understand any flaws that the show may have, which trust me, are few and far between. With a flair of character that the show gives off, there are just too many perfectly blended elements that work in conjunction with each other in order to make it the perfect romance anime.The plot of the story is as follows (don't worry, no spoilers). Ryuji is a young man that finds himself entering high-school in his second year. He happens to be in a class with his best friend, Yusaku, and his crush, Minori. However, he happens to run into the most ferocious female in his school, the Palm-Top-Tiger herself, Tiaga Aisaka. They don't hit it off instantly, but when it's found out that the Tiger has a crush on Ryuji's best friend, the shenanigans ensue as they try to help each other out in going after their crush. It is true that the best wing-men are those of opposite genders. Things change slightly when they coincidentally live side by side, and at the same height (they travel often to the others house through the window), and when Ryuji learns that Tiaga can't do anything on her own, he started playing the father figure in her life, by cooking her meals and making sure she wakes up in the morning.Mmhmm, innocent father figure, right?The one bad thing I have to say about this show is that it's predictable. There aren't too many twists and turns in the grand scheme of things, but the tiny little leans that the show gives you throughout the story are enough to keep anyone entertained. By episode five, the viewers will, sadly, know exactly who will end up with who. Or so they think. The story elements are dished out in a way that is more than enough to fill anyone, but it's like a buffet when it comes to this. Each episode is filled with plot important content, so it always leaves you with hopes and dreams of what can possibly be in the next episode. I was never bored while watching the show, and I could barely wait to hit the next episode button.Even so, there is one thing that contributes to the biggest success behind Toradora. If you haven’t guessed it yet, it’s the character development. There are five different main characters of the show, being Ryuji, Tiaga, Yusaku, Minori, and Ami. Each ones personalities are so unique, that not a single one of them can get enough screentime for me. Ryuji is the chilled, “normal” one that seems to be the voice of reason, moved along with the obsession to clean everything, yet shy enough to be just adorable when trying to talk to Minori. Tiaga is a very aggressive female character that can be oh so cute when she isn’t headbutting Ryuji in the nose. Yusaku is a popular nerd that takes school very seriously, but when paired with Minori, can be very eccentric. Ami is something of a (insert vulgar language that Crunchyroll disapproves of here), but in a loving way that you’ll understand if you simply watch the show. Now for my personal favorite, Minori, who is an insane teenage girl that quite literally makes me laugh every single scene that shes in. Seriously, just look at her. She can go from being an adorable love interest to a crazy psychopath in just a single moment. Each character get’s their own little backstory, and airtime, which means by the end of the show, everyone wants genuine happiness for all the characters. Throughout the show, I found myself wanting different characters to get together. One of the female characters would do something awesome, and I’d want them to get together, only to go and ruin it whilst another stole the spotlight, so I would cross my fingers for the new contender for a few episodes. These flip-flops of emotion just emphasizes the small turns that the characters go through during their development, and as you watch the show, your feelings for them change depending on their actions. Remind you of anything? (Real high-school love triangles).Sadly, the ending leaves a little bit to be desired, but to the shows credit, or should I say credits, it wraps it up well enough. The slowest part of the show can be considered the last three episodes, but even so, I still watched them with the same amount of love that I held for the previous twenty so episodes. One of the things that really upsets me with the last few episodes is the seemingly 180 rotation in character that Taiga undergoes. I truly liked her hard exterior that she threw up in front of Ryuji, but during the end, it became very rare. It wasn’t a Taiga that I liked as much as the original, so I didn’t feel as strongly towards her advancing slowly upon her goals. But still in the end, I felt somewhat glad that everyone was, more or less, happy to an extent. Despite the weakness of the last three episodes, it was still an engaging conclusion to a spectacular story about their crazy messed up love triangle.Despite the few amount of shortcomings that the show does have, Toradora is an amazing show to watch through, and easily makes it into my top 10 anime’s of all time. The predictability of the show can be countered by the small twists that occur every couple of episodes, and the characters alone are enough reason to keep coming back, even if the show didn't constantly push itself gracefully through the story line. I definitely recommend Toradora to everyone, of both genders, and all ages, for one of the most adorable, comedic, and comfortable romance anime’s on the market.",4
toradora,"I absolutely loved this show. I normally enjoy romance shows, but the depth and the dynamics of the characters really set this show apart from any I have watched before. There was a maturity to this show, and at certain places, things got really really ""real"". I was left somewhat unhappy by the ending, but mostly just because the show was over. YOU NEED TO WATCH AFTER THE CREDITS, OTHERWISE YOU WILL BE INCREDIBLY DEPRESSED. This show really becomes something else in the last couple episodes. Episodes 20-25 are like an incredibly different show, and it will hurt your heart a lot. I promise you will not be disappointed by Toradora.",5
toradora,"Teenagers are odd creatures.They can experience unforgettable joy and heartbreak within minutes of one another, and they are just about as predictable as a lightning strike in clear skies. However, in most media, they are rarely portrayed realistically, and this includes stories centering around them. Male protagonists have an annoying tendency to be 2-Dimensional Every-men that try too hard to seem ""relatable"" but just make it clear that the author has completely forgotten what it is like to be a high school student.This is not the case with Toradora.Each and every character in Toradora was made the way they are for a reason. Each and every one of them has a personality, hopes, and dreams guiding them. Though they are only works of fiction, the realism of the emotions they feel makes you hold them dear to your heart, making you care deeply for them as the series progresses. The series guides us through the joys, pains, and confusion of young love in such a realistic fashion that one could almost believe that it was a true story.Toradora is a truly beautiful story, and I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone with a device on which to watch it.",5
toradora,"If you're seeking to step back from the action a bit and take a break, Toradora is highly recommended!   A perfect series for a seasonal endeavor. Although a very mushy and sappy romance genre, the series brings warmth to your heart and brings the viewer closer to the characters emotions and overall dynamic. You can relate to the characters in some ways and that is certainly what you want from an Anime.  Toradora is a series that you can't just watch once. You will feel the overall emotion throughout the whole year after finishing it, making you want to watch it multiple times. A great schedule for watching it is - [Nov. 30 - Dec. 24] - If you start it the last day of November you can finish it and watch the finale on December 24, the day before Christmas!Enjoy!",5
toradora,"I know that in some ways anime's can be very predicting and even annoying at times at how predictable they are... But seriously, this anime's character development is quite unique! It constantly reels you in! The best part about this is that in some ways Toradora! teaches you about what love is in some ways... We are taught from a young age about what love is supposed to be and in some ways that's how Ryuuji and both Taiga start off with what they were taught love is- it necessarily isn't wrong- but it basically focuses on that you should love in your own way. They go from what a crush is vs. admiration of someone to actually finding out love is just being there for one another.Every character in this show has their own ways of learning love too.Minorin - to love herself before she can love othersYusake (I think I spelt his name right) - that we can love someone, but have to do things for ourselves first sometimesThe President - that even if we love someone, we need to focus on their goals and dreams in life tooAnd Ami - that loving someone isn't putting them up on a pedastool, but valuing them like an actual human being.Toradora! is love :)I will recommend it continuously to many people and already have!",5
toradora,"My first real experience with a Rom-Com was with 'Toradora!'. I cannot fully express how happy I am that it was 'Toradora!' and not some other Rom-Com. To me, 'Toradora!' displays all of the fundamental mechanics of a romantic/comedy, while also making the characters very interesting and lovable. I find in some Rom-Coms that it is very difficult to find the right mixture of lead and supporting characters, however in 'Toradora!' I could not ask for a better combination. Everyone (especially Inko-chan) fits perfectly into this incredible anime. Watch it now! Then watch 'Golden Time', they were both created by the same person and 'Golden Time' is very feelsy! Enjoy!",5
toradora,"Toradora is one those anime's you just don't watch. You absorb this anime. Why?Between the characters, the plot,  the seiyuu, and the ending it all leaves you satisfied that you watched it. I have read the light novels and this anime closely follows it to a t leaving few minor details that don't really matter(except at the end Taiga mentions that she lived near by Ryuji). This is my first review for anime that made me(a cop) cry.I highly recommend this anime and give it 100/5 stars.",5
toradora,"Toradora is a story of a boy named Ryuji and a pint-sized firecracker named Taiga. It follows them as they meet all the various challenges that life throws at them. In truth, it sounds quite bland, but a simple sentence describing this show can in no way do it any justice. Behind this normal-sounding plot hides some of the most charming and deep characters that I have ever seen in my (embarrassingly long) time watching anime. All the characters seem to be quite formulaic, but every last one of them conceals wonderful surprises that are waiting to be discovered. The interplay between the colorful cast of characters makes you really love every last one of them. This is a show that delivers on the promise of laughter, tears, and a whole mess of fun. If you haven't seen this show yet, do yourself a favor: quit reading and get watching (and for GOD'S SAKE watch the last episode to the very last second after the credits!!).",5
toradora,"ToRaDoRa!I was working in a campus computer lab last year, was three weeks ahead in all of my college courses, and had nothing to do. So I watched ToRaDoRa! Why not? I'd never heard of it before and wanted to watch something other than Code Geass for the ninth time, although Code Geass is anime gold, but... You know what I mean. I didn't think much of the show and decided it would just be filler until my next test...Twenty-five episodes later I had stayed up three nights in a row without sleeping, laughed my head off countless times, and cried twice. Through the writing, voice acting, and story I felt immersed in the lives of these characters. By the end of the show you have actually grown to like these characters so much that you miss watching the show.You will root for your favorite character and cry with them by the end of the show. I cannot recommend a more beautiful anime to watch. The animation and art are gorgeous, the characters are well developed and written, and the dialogue (and monologue) is realistic and funny. The characters are written and developed in a way that makes you feel like they are based off of real kids. Most anime based around the high school days rarely portrays the characters like most high school kids really are. There's always some whimsical, supernatural oddity going on and high school is just the cover story for it.ToRaDoRa! simply tells a story as if it were taken out of a real teenager's diary and made into a screenplay. Whilst watching I could relate to the things the characters were going through and experiencing, unlike many of the anime I have watched where I cannot relate to the characters in the slightest. ToRaDoRa! is a story of real life and it is portrayed realistically and beautifully without fluffing up reality or making it out to be what it is not.The show leaves you with just enough information that you don't feel like every episode is a cliff hanger, yet you still feel the urge to keep watching until you finish it! And once you have finished it you will either 1. Cry tears of joy or sadness depending on who your favorite character is.2. Watch it again.3. 1 and 2.What more can I say? This anime is beautiful. The story is what makes it so good. It could have been a book for all I care and I still would have loved it. Watch it, adore it, love it!-Mikael",5
toradora,"I really enjoyed this one, If you happen to be a member atm this is a must watch. I am normally not a huge fan of romantic comedy’s but, a friend I really trust recommended this one to me, so I thought I would give it a try and I’m happy I did. This show has everything, comedy, romance, character development, and it actually ends on a satisfying note (at least for me, may not be an ideal ending for everyone). Overall, it’s a good watch and Taiga is just too funny. If you end up really enjoying this one I would highly recommend watching ""My Little Monster"" (see my profile for a review), and if you’re looking to take advantage of your membership then I would recommend watching ""Kimi ni Todoke - From Me To You"" (review also on my profile). Most of it is also limited to members. Hope you enjoy Toradora as much as I did!!",5
toradora,"I normally try to avoid spoilers of any kind when writing reviews, but I can't with this one.  Until then, I'll make a brief spoiler-free intro, and after I'll make a brief spoiler-free outro.**My opinions expressed here are solely calculated and intuitive observations.  Being that my reasoning behind my review is somewhat controversial, I realize some self-serving internet extremists will find this ""not helpful"".  To all those who read this, please take only into account what I have written, not what people say about it.  That is all I ask.  I'm not saying you should agree with me, I'm asking for you to respect my beliefs and opinions.  Thank you.  I wish I didn't have to write this, but the internet being what it is, I must.**To begin, this was probably one of the best animes ever created in terms of story and development.  All characters, even supporting ones, get an incredible dosage of character development and you learn to love all of them.  There is no sudden and unexpected change of attitude or random plot holes.  To tack on with that, the sheer and incredible infusion of advanced story-telling elements is incredible.  The thought-provokingly awesome symbolism and irony leaves nothing to be hated.This could have been a legendary anime.  It could have been perhaps one of the greatest animes of any genre ever created.And then the writers tripped up on the ending.  And yes, I watched past the credits.  Yes I understand the implications.Before I begin the true review, I will leave a couple words for those who wish not to take spoilers.In the end Ryuji has three choices, essentially, of relationship paths to take.1) Really good ending.2) Tear-jerkingly amazing ending.3) Absolutely, needingly, undeniably best ending.*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideThis anime was really good....And that's all it is.In order, the above choices were between Taiga, Minori, and Ami.  So yes, I am saying that the creators took the worse of the three routes.Taiga's was the ""safe"" path.  It was predictably obvious and drastically unrealistic.Let me explain.Taiga and Ryuji functioned best as a family-sort.  Ryuji being the father-figure Taiga never had, and Ryuji finally getting the chance to take care of someone like he always wanted.  Their relationship helped push both of them out of the false, isolated paths they were both in at the social level.  They boosted each other into the spotlight and helped each other become okay with who each other was.  But that's as far as it should have gone.  I can honestly say I am not 100% convinced by their ""mutual love"".  Shoot, I act as Ryuji does towards multiple people, some of the opposite gender, but never would anyone be fooled that we share any sort of feelings beyond friendship.  Love just doesn't happen the way this anime depicted it to.  Love doesn't just ""happen"", contrary to popular belief.  There is always a reason for it.What makes the fact that their relationship was turned the wrong way is the way the ending of the show went.  The final 6 episodes were drastically different than the anime's feel, which is totally okay normally; but this time around, the show lost sight of its original path and fell to nothing but angst and drama.  This was especially prevalent with the final two episodes.  There is absolutely and unarguably nothing but built-up hope and passion that the classmates will be together forever.  Obviously not entirely possible, but in order to not totally lose sight of the anime's true nature, the creators were forced to take a path that isolated everyone from each other, essentially.  I'm not saying that the feelings weren't right, and given different circumstances it would have been the best possible ending.But cue stage entrance left, Minori Kushieda and Ami Kawashima.Let me start with the first.If Ryuji paired up with Minori, this anime would have been absolutely stunning.  Easy 5 stars, easily on my top 5 list.Minori is fairly clearly only airheaded for the sake of avoiding pain.  She is a character who has so helplessly fallen in love with Ryuji but keeps pretending she isn't for the sake of Taiga.  She makes arguably the biggest sacrifice for her friend.  She gives up her own happiness and her only love for someone else.  She doesn't just smile through her tears, she laughs while her heart is speared by a toxic-soaked diamond blade.  Admirable, sure.  But not okay in terms of story development.  It doesn't feel right as a watcher to see her pain.Not to mention that Ryuji did truly love her, and she truly loved him.  It was a mutual feeling and the writers should not have let this one slip through the cracks as if it was okay.  I am NOT saying that people can't get hurt.  But unnecessary pain is not okay.  Because by any means the reason they didn't end up together is because Minori bottled up her heart.But any other note, why is her relationship not the best ending?Because Ami Kawashima.She is by no doubt the most incredible character in the story.  She isn't flawless, and she knows it.  But she found her true self.  She is the wisest and most realistic person in the entire show.And the most self-sacrificing and loving character we will probably ever have the honor of seeing.Ami loves Ryuji for the most legitimate reasons of all of them.  She learned who he was as a man.  She accepted him as a person, as he did her.  And slowly, surely, they consistently saved each other and covered each other's 6.  As Ami said, they were on equal playing field.But unlike what she said, she wasn't always one step ahead of him.  After the scene in the gym shed where she was making ornaments, she fell hopelessly a step behind.  She wouldn't just come out with her feelings and kept talking in code.  She was always reaching out when he ran off to be a hero or of the sorts.  ""But wait...""And she did nothing.  Completely OOC.Now Ryuji was listening,  And Ryuji probably would eventually have deciphered what she said.  But Ami made one mistake.She ran away when Ryuji needed her most.  I'm talking about when he was shot down by Minori (for Taiga's sake).Ami, like Minori, gave up her honest and real love for Ryuji.  But this time, she did it for someone she only recently met.  She was sacrificing herself for the others, trying to maintain a balance that could never be kept.I cried once this anime.  And it was after the shoe scene with Ami.  After that, I lost all traces of any sort of hope for an ""Ami route"".  She had given up.  By snatching her shoe from Ryuji and storming off (which by the way the shoe represented her refusal to just come out with her feelings and give herself up to Ryuji), she had finally and officially quit all pursuit of Ryuji.  And I bawled my eyes out.I could only think of one thing:""Ami won't get Ryuji.""My heart closed up after this scene and has remained bottled up for the last 3 days.  I still get on the verge of tears thinking about the loss Ami suffered.I don't feel that way for any other characters.  If Ryuji went with anyone else, I would only ever feel upset for Ami.If the creators took this ending, it would be the first anime I have ever seen that I would give 6 stars....Ryuji's head was awash and a mess after his rejection.  Honestly, he probably liked all three girls equally, but didn't go so far as to love any of them yet.  But given his character development, the first one to be honest with him won.And Taiga won.  By pure dumb luck of mumbling to the wrong person in a half-conscious state of blurred unawareness.After episode 8 it became a struggle for me to watch because I saw the direction the anime was taking, and I didn't like it.  After episode 18, I had to sit on my hands to prevent myself from skipping episodes.I love everything about this anime, but the fact Ryuji ended up with Taiga is not okay. *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*This is an anime that could have been legendary.  But it took the safe route and only ended up good.If you are a more intellectual viewer, and you care mostly about the relationships in animes, I'd actually recommend you not watch this unless you have no other animes to watch.  It becomes a struggle to watch through the scenes knowing the ending route its taking, and at the end you heart yearns for more, but not in a good way.  You want to change the ending, and you will spend a decently large portion of time, wasting time thinking about what it should have been.I'm not accusing anyone who loved this anime as being stupid or discrediting their taste.  If you loved it, good.  I am happy you found enjoyment out of this, because that is what this type of anime is for.However I will say this: Toradora! Portable is a fantastic game that allows you to redo where the anime screwed up and take the ending you wish.  So if you make it through the anime and, like me, wish to fix the problem of the ending, then play it.  At the very least it will help you get the thing the clinging to your heart off.I'm not saying the ending was wrong, because it wasn't.  I'm not saying the anime isn't fantastic, because it is.  I'm not saying that the given character who Ryuji ends up with is bad, because she isn't.But this could have been my first ever 6-star anime.I guess I keep on searching.",5
toradora,"Toradora is a series that defines its genre, and in my opinion is a wonderful example of anime as a story telling medium and the art form as a whole. On the surface, it seems like a fairly simple love story, but dig in a little and you'll see that it's so much more than that. Toradora shows what it means to fall in love, and it shows us that sometimes nothing is everything. Once it's all over, it leaves you wanting more but at the same time knowing that any additions couldn't do justice to what you already have. The strength of a romance lies in its characters, and Toradora delivers. The characters are all extremely well written, as are their dynamics with each other. The words they chose to say and actions they take all make sense for who they are, and you're never left wondering why the characters do and say the things that they do. You're happy to see them happy, and you're sad when they're sad. The characters are all easy to empathize with, and we've all been in their positions at some point. Repeat viewings especially illustrate that point, as it can be easy to miss some of the more profound moments the first time through. In short, even if you don't prefer romances or slice of life series, Toradora is worth your time. I honestly believe that Toradora is a series that every anime fan should watch at least once, and that it has the strength to convert non-fans. As I said before, Toradora is a true example of excellent storytelling and of anime as a whole. I really can't recommend this series enough. ________________________________________________So, everything above this line still holds true, and applies to the dub version as well. While the dub isn't perfect, it certainly lives up to what fans should expect for such a wonderful series. I'll be the first to admit, when I heard the dub voices in the trailer for the first time, I wasn't sold. That said, the voice actors brought their A games for this one, and they do a fantastic job of giving each of the characters the personality and spirit fans of the Japanese version know and love. As someone who loves this series, I can happily say that the dubbed version lives up to the original, and I whole heartedly hope that this release will introduce more people to this incredible series and create a whole new group of fans. If you were a fan of the original, I encourage you to watch the dub as well, it certainly does not disappoint.In short, whether it's the original Japanese or the English dub, 「とらドラ」というアニメが本当に大好きだよ！",5
toradora,"An anime that always blows away a person the most is one that he/she had little expectations for, and Toradora is the best example I can think of.  After I saw this anime I felt like I had to text everyone I know and demand that they watch it now, until I realized, not many of my friends like anime... The main quality of Toradora that amazed me so much is the character development, there is not one useless character in this show. It's a story that's been done so many times, but Toradora gets it right. It's no surprise that the director of Toradora also directed Honey & Clover 2, another very highly regarded slice-of-life anime. There are some viewers that would say this anime is flawed, but in my opinion that's the beauty of it. Yes, there are some flaws, but it's impossible to have a perfect anime. The fact that there are flaws and it still manages to be one of my all-time favorite anime is the true greatness of it. There might be an anime out there that is ""better made"" than this one but there is no anime with a bigger heart, which is truly a measure of excellence. I often compare this anime to another one of my favorites, Cross Game. I would say Cross Game is nearly as good or tied with Toradora because both have amazing character development. Cross Game is slower and longer, but if you loved Toradora, definitely give it a shot. Both of these anime will be regarded as classics for years to come.",5
toradora,"There is something strangely unique about Toradora.Down from the way it begins, to the way it ends. There is just something strange about it and I could never quite put my finger on it. As I rewatched this anime, I have realized that it was indeed something beautifully orchestrated. At first you think you know how it is going to end, and y'know what, you may just be right. But understanding the ending does not make the content inbetween anyless important. And that is where Toradora shines.Scene from Scene, this anime captivates your mind. It keeps you intrigued, have you laughing while moments later you will feel sadness and anger. This anime is very good at drawing out the emotions in characters, the development between each one is perfect. As those character you first think are shallow, eventually flesh out to have far deeper meanings behind their actions.Especially Minorin.So, that is why I rate this five stars.If you seen animes like 'Pet girl of Sakura-Hall'. And enjoyed it, this will be a pleasant experience for you as well.",5
toradora,"Story PreviewSpoiler Alert! Click to show or hideOn the outside, Ryuiji looks like a tough mutt. He has the image of a delinquent. However, people misunderstand him. On the inside, he is really a nice boy, overflowing with kindness, and has the cleaning and cooking abilities of a housewife.

Like seriously, I've watched a heck load of anime. Out of all the years I've watched these shows, there's never been one as moving, and heart-gripping as Toradora. I'm a guy, so usually i'm not the least interested in these types of anime, however, i'm not the least regretful. This is the only anime with an ending that i'm completely satisfied with...but also unsatisfied with. There's a void in my heart that only a show like this can fill. I'm satisfied with the ending, but unsatisfied because that it ended (weird cycle, I know). I sometimes find myself awake at night, wishing there was more. That's how powerful this anime was to me. I gave it a shot, so should you.",5
toradora,"I can count on one hand the number of school romance/slice of life animes I've watched to completion. Most of the genre I stop watching after only a few episodes, and I generally avoid the whole genre altogether. I don't know what possessed me to give this one a shot, but I don't regret it... ok, maybe a little bit, my butt hurts from being glued to the screen marathoning the whole thing. Bottom Line Up Front: if you like romantic comedy, school drama, slice of life shows, watch it. If you're not sure, give it a shot. If you don't like the genre, still give it a shot. I'm not a big fan of the genre, but I thoroughly enjoyed watching the show, enough to even write a review about it.Here's the long version of the review:Toradora is a romantic comedy in a Japanese high school setting. There are two main protagonists with three other major supporting characters. The story centers around these five characters and their interactions, feelings towards each other, relationships and hardships. Ultimately it is a love story, but more than that it's a dramatic coming of age story. There are many references throughout the show on maturity and the passing from childhood to adulthood, and it's interesting to see the symbolism employed to bring out that theme and how each character, with their unique personality, approaches it. It's subtle at first, but each character develops so well, not too quickly, not too much, but just enough to let you know how much they've grown. Some may consider the character development ""incomplete,"" and it some sense that is the case. There are many loose ends and unanswered questions at the end, but the show ends beautifully, just where it should. There's a line in the show that goes ""We are far too young to talk about life philosophy, we still have at least 10, 20, 60 years ahead of us,"" which seems to suggest the ""loose ends"" were intentional. The climax and ending is pretty typical and predictable, but a last minute twist on the story would not be suitable, and it would only cheapen the show as a gimmick. There is plenty of ""fan service,"" but not so excessive that it takes away from the story or characters.Characters:Ryuji Takasu - one of the main protagonists. Typical nice guy, with qualities suited for a housewife - good cook, enjoys cleaning and other sorts of housework. His character twist is that he has hard eyes that make him look like a delinquent and therefore everyone at school treats him like one. Unfortunately, his character development was a bit disappointing. There were some small movements in the end, but overall didn't develop as much as the other characters.Taiga Aisaku - other main protagonist. Short definition: napoleon complex tsundere character. The initial impression of her is that she is a spoiled princess type. Feisty, short tempered, strong and quick to get into physical confrontations. She doesn't have a very nice personality and can barely take care of herself (lives like a slob). Pretty good character development, a bit predictable, but it was done really well. She ended up a depth and dimension rarely seen with characters of her type in most other shows.Yusaku - Ryuji's best and only friend at the start of the series. He is vice-president of the school council, class representative, captain of the baseball team (or men's softball, that part wasn't made very clear) and also has pretty good grades. Seems to start off as the nice, smart, popular and driven support character, and it seemed he would be forever be in the back seat, relegated to nothing more than a supporting role, but he ended up having much more depth and character than initially thought. Tends to provide some of the ""lighter"" comic relief. His character development is almost non-existent at first, then all of sudden makes a huge leap. Still, like most male characters in this genre, the development is a bit weak.Minori Kushieda - starts as the typical happy go lucky space cadet with ADHD. Almost playing the same sort of role as Yusaku and similarly, also almost relegated to the back seat as just another support character. However, her character development is one of the best in the show. She turns out to be so much more complex. The way her mask cracks and then breaks near the end of the series was simply fantastic.Kawashima Ami - childhood friend of Yusaku and also a model for magazines. She's pretty, has a smoking hot body, popular and also very manipulative. Starts out as the pretty girl that naturally clashes with the female lead. Initially felt she was just another ""filler"" character meant for fan service and to act as a distraction for the male lead, but turns out to be the most complex character in the show. Many people may disagree with that assessment, since her development is the most subtle. Her ""crisis"" episode happens very early on, and then she's never the focus of the story again, but slowly as the story progresses the deeper layers of her character are revealed,usually indirectly.",5
toradora,"Toradora! is a series that can be successfully enjoyed regardless of your tastes in genre. The development of the main characters allows the viewers to deeply care about the outcome of their stories. Furthermore, as the series progresses into its second part, the show goes into high gear feeding from a strong story and cast of characters that are backed by an impeccable voice acting. Toradora! is a masterful execution of an high school drama and slice of life (and maybe the best one out there) that teaches how character development is supposed to be done. Hoping for a movie. Extremely recommended. Masterpiece. 95/100.",5
toradora,"I’m not going to hide the fact that I’m a big fan of romance shows. In fact, Toradora is the first official anime that got me into watching anime and at the time, I believed that this show was a special romantic comedy that I would always cherish and remember. A few years later, I have watched a lot more anime and I can still say that Toradora is one of my personal favorites. Why? It’s because Toradora does things the right way. Keep in mind that after about 2 years of watching anime, I say it’s about time that I write a review and what better way to start my 1st review than with the anime that started it all for me: Toradora.Story:The premise of Toradora is quite simple, but unique. The main protagonists, Ryuuji and Taiga, both have crushes on each other’s respective friend, Yuusaku and Minori. The story basically follows Ryuuji and Taiga as they agree to help each other win the heart of their respective crushes: Ryuuji with Minori and Taiga with Yuusaku. To be honest, I thought the story was fairly predictable, but it’s still unique because of how they executed it. Both Ryuuji and Taiga start off by heavily disliking each other and are only willing to work with one another to gain the ones that they’re in love with. Definitely not your standard rom-com. The anime does a great job in making it’s concept unique because it falls away from your standard romance clichés and the way how they portrayed Ryuuji and Taiga growing closer with one another was something I never fully expected at first. In fact, the way they decided to develop Ryuuji and Taiga’s relationship was unpredictable in of itself and I really appreciated that. The characters definitely deserve most of the credit for the actual unpredictability of the story and for its overall uniqueness from other rom-com.Characters:This is one area that I believe Toradora truly shines in. One of the things that ticked me off in any romance anime is how some characters would sometimes “force” drama for the sake of drama. Some of the decisions made by these characters to create drama can be unnecessary and annoying at times. But Toradora’s cast avoids these clichés and the interactions that they have with each other feel genuine and real. There are 5 main characters that appear: Ryuuji, Taiga, Minori, Yuusaku, and Ami. All of them go through some impressive development and their bond with each other is only strengthened by the well-executed interactions. Yes, there is still drama in Toradora, but the drama is convincing because the characters actually have a reason and a motive for the actions that they choose throughout the anime. I will have to say that if you’re the type of person who hates tsunderes, then Toradora is an anime that you should probably stay away from because they didn’t call Taiga the Queen of Tsunderes for nothing. Taiga starts off pretty much the very embodiment of what a tsundere is, but here’s another major plus point for Toradora: Taiga can also be considered somewhat of a deconstruction of a stereotypical tsundere and the fact that she develops heavily throughout the series, turns her into a great character by the end if you are willing to give her a chance. Art/Animation:Toradora was produced in 2008 by studio J.C. Staff and while I can say that the animation is pretty decent for the most part, the art isn’t the best part about this show. I’m going to be completely honest here; Toradora does not have the greatest art ever. In fact, I’ve seen better art in other anime of the same genre. Unlike most rom-coms that I have watched, Toradora’s art is mainly average and at first, I was even unsure about watching this show because the character designs weren’t exactly my type. But don’t let this shortcoming prevent you from watching this fantastic rom-com. It’s important not to judge a show by its cover.Sound:Toradora’s music was composed by Yukari Hashimoto, who composed music for other shows like Golden Time. Besides a few piano tracks that I enjoy listening to, the soundtrack for the most part is nothing absolutely amazing to write home about. Honestly though, I don’t need Toradora’s soundtrack to be godlike or anything cause I watched this show for the story and characters and I got what I wanted. If I wanted to watch an anime with amazing soundtracks, I would watch anime having composers like Yuki Kajiura, Yoko Kanno, Joe Hisaishi, Kenji Kawai or something. One track that stands out to me in Toradora is “Lost My Pieces”. It’s a very nice piece that does a great job in portraying the emotions that’s going on in that specific scene and definitely a track that I could listen to on its own. Lastly, I wasn’t the biggest fan of the opening and ending themes, so yeah.Enjoyment:I truly enjoyed watching Toradora and the characters play a huge role in my enjoyment. I think I was able to enjoy Toradora to its fullest because no one completely steals the show here. Instead the 5 main characters I mentioned earlier develop great chemistry with one another that watching them interact with one another is already enough to get me excited. The fact that I’m constantly trying to figure out how each relationship is going to be developed, definitely helped in my enjoyment.Overall:Toradora is a unique and a fantastic rom-com. Honestly, I consider this show to be one of the greatest rom-coms that I’ve ever watched and 2 years later, I’m still saying that. Sure, Toradora is not perfect and in fact has its share of problems though I refuse to mention these issues due to spoilers. Would I recommend watching Toradora? Definitely yes. If you’re a person that wants a unique rom-com with fantastic characters and assuming you can be patient with tsunderes, then Toradora is right up your alley. Thank you for reading my 1st review and remember that this is just my opinion and my opinion alone. If you think my review is helpful in convincing you to watch Toradora then that makes me really happy and if it doesn’t, I’m already happy knowing that you at least decided to read my review in the first place.",5
toradora,Toradora is the single best romantic comedy I have ever seen.  The writing is top quality and will keep you interested from the very beginning and just pull you in more and more towards the end.  This is a show that absolutely destroys the writing and character development of most other rom coms.  It is a show that I can easily recommend to fans of romantic comedy or even those who are often put off by the genre.,5
toradora,"This needs to be said, WATCH AFTER THE CREDITS. I have seen so many people who don't do it, but seriously, you have to watch after the credits!To be completely honest, I'm not a big fan of the romance genre in general. So when a friend of mine mentioned this show, I immediately shrugged it off because of the lack of fantasy that I always watch. I can't believe I actually put this show off because of that. Toradora! is nothing like any other romance show, it goes into the deeper meaning of love and even though you realize what will eventually happen pretty early on the story, the way the show is presented is absolutely perfect. The only truly stereotypical character is Ryuuji being the ""nice-guy"" and no Taiga is not really a tsundere. Watch Riyogaa's review for a much better review than this.",4
toradora,"Alright so, five categories, five possible stars. Go!Plot: 4.2/5Overall very excellent plot, however, there were some hiccups in there for me for the way the plot develops for me. Like,  Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideAmi's tone changes throughout the anime even though she wants the be ""cute"" and ""nice"" to everyone, but kind of just found a medium between her two sides. Though I may be missing something here.Artwork: 4.6/5Artwork is very picky for me, sometimes I judge an anime based on it's artwork alone. (I know this is bad, though can't stand some of the styles...) But this anime has a great artwork style! Taiga is really cute :)VO: 4.8/5Overall good VO's, nothing to really complain about here.Characters: 5/5Great choice of characters! Large and wide variety of different characters with their own personalities, and takes a twist on the usual mom, for Ryuji anyway.Ending: 4.8/5Some may wonder why I judge ending here, but it's because I really, really dislike cliffhangers, but this doesn't do any of that horse hockey. Nice and tidy conclusion, which is nice for a change.  Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideI'm looking at you, no game no life.Overall: Great anime, a must watch. 4.5/5.",4
toradora,"So every once in a while I like to take a break from my normal shounen/action anime binges and browse for a ticket for the feels train. Now I, myself - and I think I speak for a lot of guys out there who don't want to admit it - have a soft spot for sappy romance and love stories, as long as it isn't too cheesy and they don't botch it. I was definitely not disappointed when I randomly selected the masterpiece that is Toradora. This show did an incredible job in showing amazing friendships, how diverse and complex someone's thoughts can be, bringing out the importance of family, and of course a love story that we can all only dream of (unless you're really lucky). The drama and plot of it was all done in a very smooth fashion and never had any cheesy or  over - dramatic moments. It had you feeling so happy for some of the characters while making you very sad for some of the others that you were possibly routing for the whole time. It had you trying to guess what would happen in the end rather than making it too obvious. And of course it had you riding a very bumpy feels train the whole time. I don't know about you, but I love the feels.The characters as well were so much fun to watch and made for a really exciting show. Everyone had their own unique personality, and Ryuji and Taiga simply made one of my favorite duos in all of anime. Each and every one of them were hilarious and they had me going from laughing one moment to crying the next (yes, man-tears were shed) or just watching with the biggest smile.They also even had some pretty BA fight scenes that you wouldn't really have expected, which was totally awesome.All in all, coming from a guy who really enjoys an occasional well done Slice of Life/Romantic Comedy to go along with my action anime, Toradora was fun, very emotional as well as thought-provoking, and was one that I thought definitely deserved one more 5-star review (by yours truly).Hope you watch, and if you do you will surely enjoy!",5
toradora,I think if i was in my death bed and someone asked me what was my favorite anime of all time i would have say To... ra...do...ra.......bleh then i would die... At the end of this series i found my self relating to myself to a lot of the situations presented in the show. I only watched the dub so far but i recommend watching it on your language (if your language is Japanese or english) so you can feel the emotion in some of the best voice actors i have ever heard,5
toradora,"I rarely write reviews for any of these I watch. However, I had to do it for this particular series. I've watched many stories, but by far this is probably the most incredible story for its genre I've ever seen. I am a particularly emotionless sort of man and rarely get worked up for real life issues to fictional stories. Yet this one actually brought out an emotional response for me and I loved it. I highly recommend watching this! I just wish they had continued with the series.",5
toradora,"Honestly IMO Toradora is either something you will like or not. It's far from a plain romance and yet romance loves could very well get caught up watching it over and over again. The show itself is a mesh mash of everything. You have action, drama, romance comedy and just a little bit of everything. Granted it starts out a little all over the place but cleans up nicely as it goes along.As far as characters go the main two Ryuji Takasu and Taiga Aisaku are far from outstanding in their own right. Now before you bash me lol I will explain. They are in all rights nothing special which is outstanding. Despite their outward appearances and reputations they are normal. They are not made out to be handsome and beautiful. They are not a cut above the rest. A normal person can find it easy to relate to these two. That right there makes this a special series in its own right. As the description states Ryuji is just dealt a bad hand when looks are involved thanks to his father and it completely masks how the boy really is. Mean while Taiga is making up for her stature.Then you have Minori Kushieda and Ami. These two are polar opposites. Minori is a sports fanatic and all around overly energetic. Ami is a semi calm and collected model with a slight personality disorder from time to time. Both grow on you as the story progresses.Moving along to good ol' Yusaku. I would define him as a book worm and over achiever but if anything he is a dedicated friend to Ryuji. That right there makes him a interesting side character. Anyone that has stuck beside Ryuji has got some serious dedication to friends. I could go on about all the characters but that would ruin what you will learn if you have not watch the series and just be repetitive to those that have watched. So I will end with characters like this. They are a good bunch that really pulls things together. You may not like them sometimes but you sure as heck won't hate them.Now the story itself is your basic love/life story. You can find things to relate to and other things are just maybe out of this world for some viewers. Lets face it not everyone has the same life experiences but things tie everyone together. I can't say my school life was like this but there are things in the show that match up with my life and others will probably feel the same way. Really there is no need to go into detail. If you watch a good bit of shows or think about life in general then you can have a rough idea of how things go.The animation was well done yet not over done. I don't think it should be done any better then how it is now. It was really smooth and the facial expressions went from anywhere between mundane to extremely intense. You are not really left guessing how someone is feeling unless it was meant that way.The voices fit the characters. The pitch and elevation of the voices went perfectly with the characters draw expressions and body language. I don't really have a lot of this.The music for the openings and closings were outstanding. I actually enjoyed sitting threw the openings and closing every time. After watching the series a few times I started skipping ahead but over all I always make sure to catch it all once in a while just because.Overall I really enjoyed Toradora and would highly suggest it to anyone. Take the time to just sit down watch it and soak it all in. Laugh, cry and scream at all that is offered to you in this wonderful series. Oh and for the love of all that is holy lol makes sure you watch every last second of it all. I say that for a reason. So do it!!! Lol.Thanks for your time. Enjoy the show.RaiderP.s. This is my first review written period lol. If you want to critic it feel free to send me a message with your thoughts good or bad. Being human means we make mistakes and learn from them. Later.",5
toradora,"I'll start off by saying that I am not a fan of love triangles because they are usually shallow. But, this anime did it right. I cared for all of the character deeply and was cheering various characters on throughout the series. This a great lighthearted romantic drama. Comedy is heavier towards the beginning of the series while taking a more dramatic turn in the latter half. Also, this anime contains the most beautiful kissing scene of all time. I won't spoil the characters involved but it was magnificent. This anime is a must watch for romance fans.",5
toradora,"Ever wonder what Toradora means? well, Tora means Tiger which is our Female Protagonist: TaigaDora: means Doragan and specifically means dragon meaning our Male Protagonist:RyujiWhile I see there encounter and daily challenges I will came to love them in every way, I can't say Toradora is for everyone, cause some of these stuff are incredibly deep- but if life have taught you anything don't jump off this rollercoaster until it reaches to the top! (that is if your deciding to watch..)",5
toradora,"Toradora is a slice of life, romantic comedy that consistently tugs at your heart. On more than one occasion I found my eyes watering from the joy this show brings. Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideIn a nutshell, it starts out with Ryūji having a crush on Minori, who is friends with Taiga, who has a crush on Yūsaku, who is friends with Ryūji... heh, say all that three times fast. So Ryūji and Taiga work together to get closer to their crushes. But as time goes on, they begin to notice each other. This is a story of their relationship.",5
toradora,"When CR first added Toradora, i marathoned it and it was sheer amazingness, it instantly became tied for my #1 favorite anime of all time, for some reason I never rated or reviewed it but now I am.I sooo wish there was another season or some sort of continuation (It has a few ova's and they're pretty good.) i would go into detail about why I love Taiga and Ryugi and everyone else, but if I did this review would be a bit like a novel, its that good.",5
toradora,"You know something's special when you come across it and after you finish, you simply NEED to watch it again. Having been one of the first anime shows I've ever seen, Toradora!, the first time I saw it, did not command a very good first impression on me, and this was all because I simply didn't get enough exposure as it was to anime television. Nevertheless, by the end, I was telling myself, that this was one of those shows that I really did not regret watching. I had to watch it again.Sometimes, I think the first look only gives you the first impression. Because the second time around, things tend to get a little better. Was that the case here? This is what I thought.Plot: Whenever you compare an anime such as Toradora!, it's only fair to compare such a show to other shows within the same setting and genre of romantic comedy. When doing that, you can bring up shows like Special A!, Kaichou wa Maid-sama, and other high school romantic comedies, since they basically stick to the same plot, albeit minor details that can always be differentiated. I wouldn't count on that for Toradora!, which is a very good thing.Takasu Ryuuji, the protagonist with an evil look in his eye, has had feelings for another girl, Kushieda Minori, for quite some time. Things are going well, because this is a normal high school setting, of course until Ryuuji stumbles upon a love letter for Ryuuji's best friend, Kitamura Yusaku, written by the most feared girl in the whole school, Aisaka Taiga. After a misunderstanding and some kind of mutual agreement between the two, they form a friendship in which they help each other get to the ones carrying each of their affections.Up to this point in time, the only thing I've seen were high school anime shows. Kaichou wa Maid-Sama and Special A, so to speak, shared a storyline, and it really got to me when I made that transition into watching one to the other, so the only thing I could think was, ""these were absolutely similar, how will Toradora! surprise me here?"" Sure enough, unlike the main characters having things like initial attraction or just that defining factor that tells the viewers, ""these are the main characters and you know how this plays out, deal with it,"" Toradora! pins the two protagonists on opposite ends, without any attraction whatsoever, practically disgusted towards one another, and then throws them back into the mix of high school anime. How did it play out? Good job, writers. While it can't be helped, that we know how a series of events will turn out (though I can tell they tried their best not to make it predictable), what has been restored is the fact that this situation allows for a deeper storyline, which means better character development and less fillers. It's easy to fill in a generic structure and just fill in characters for certain roles, but to the writers, I really salute you for this one.Characters: Characters can always be replaced. You can easily replace the role of a character in a great number of genres, and that's the issue with many high school anime shows. They lack value because the flattest characters can be used and it can still be passed as a decent show so long as you change one or two elements, but not for Toradora!, that's for sure. I like the fact that Ryuuji's case is one based on looks; nobody wants to get near him just because of that supposed ""wild look in his eyes"", Taiga with her tsundere-type personality that eventually blossoms into something a little different, and Minori with her unique personality and key moments that are quite essential to the storyline.The downside to this, I fear to say, is the fact that these are the three characters that seem to have received most of the writer's attention; while the others are worth noting, these three characters really give Toradora! its ability to shine. From my observation, they've undergone the greatest amount of character development. I think it's a bit of a shame, as I was hoping for the characters to receive an equal amount of development; this eliminates the idea of favoritism and makes it seem less like the writers are pointing you in one direction by siding with one specific character.Content: Nothing new here, to be honest, aside from your typical high school romantic comedy routine with its own kick. Minori's quirkiness really plays a key role in providing the comedy relief; standing up during class to give her take on airheads, her radar, love of spicy foods, list goes on. In addition, the other characters do have their own strange moments as well, and unlike a show that is confused by its own genre, Toradora! throws in just the right amount of comedy to complement its heart-dropping moments. Fun and playful when it's necessary, and serious when it counts. Is it a perfect blend? It's one of the best I've seen so far.Miscellaneous: For starters, I have the openings and endings of Toradora! all stored on my computer, and they happen to be among the most played songs in my playlist. What can I say, whenever an addicting pop track comes around? Just itching to download and press repeat. Animation wasn't top-notch, but it was definitely one of the higher-quality shows I've seen.Well, that's really all I have to say about that.Overall: Let's say that you've seen the shows I've mentioned above. Let's say that you've also seen a good number of other high school romantic comedies and are quite avid with them, but haven't seen Toradora! yet. Knowing that, let me throw one thing out there for you: you can't call yourself avid in this genre if you don't know what the benchmark looks like. In my opinion, in this genre, in this niche, whatever you would like to call it or categorize it under, this is the anime to beat, this is the story that others should strive to write, and this is just another show that will withstand the test of time, because I'm sure it will continue to pop up as a suggestion. Sure, there are other high school romantic comedies that can beat Toradora!, such shows including Clannad (which, arguably, does not even belong in this genre), but to be honest, you'd be hard-pressed to find a show in this genre that can deprive Toradora! of this title that I've given it.So, asking me whether or not it's worth the watch, see for yourself why this show receives positive reviews. It won't help if you continue to put off watching.",5
toradora,"Short Synopsis:This show revolves around the high-school years, struggles, and love life of Aisaka Taiga and Ryuji Takasu.  There really isn't much else to it.Characters:There are five major characters in this show.  They are as follows:Taiga: A chibi tsundere, that sums her up very well.Ryuji: He is constantly mistaken for a delinquent because of his appearance, but really he's just a clean freak.Kitamaru: Ryuji's best friend, on the student council, and also a bit insane.Minori: Taiga's best friend who is always happy and is on the softball team.Kawashima: Kitamaru's childhood friend, and a model.The characters all have their own personal feeling for one another, loving each other and not wanting to admit it, secretly hating each other at times, loving each other and not knowing it.  The overall chemistry between the characters was very good, and I enjoyed it.  There is a decent character development over the course of the show, all the characters changed for the better, in my opinion, by the end from how they were when they were first introduced.Story/Plot:We all know how these shows go, obvious couple ends up together by the end and this is no exception.  The story wasn't actually bad though, it had it's sad moments, funny moments, and very memorable moments.  The story revolves around the school life of Taiga and Ryuji, their love lives and finally them ending up together.  It's decently done and I wasn't really let down.  Toradora did a better job than most for it's genre in terms of it's story-line albeit predictable.Music:The BGM didn't really stick with me at all, I doubt I'd ever recognize it.  The OP/ED weren't bad but not really memorable to me.  Overall the music wasn't bad, but it doesn't really stand out either, it's just average.Artwork/Art-style:The artwork wasn't bad at all, I wasn't really disappointed by it and I doubt others would be.  It wasn't the greatest, again it was just average.Enjoyment:This is what's most important, is it enjoyable?  Yes, Toradora is something I really did enjoy.  I kept wanting to watch some more after each sitting.  There's definitely better out there, but this is something worth taking the time to watch.  It had it's good share of comedy and sadness to make it into a very enjoyable and memorable show that I would recommend to others.Pros/Cons:+ Better story than most in it's genre+ Nice set of characters and their development+Some very memorable moments- Predictable ending- A few annoying side charactersFinal Score: 4.4/5 starsReviewed by RAZ. Revised and edited by HG",5
toradora,"In a sea of moe and/or classroom drama type animes, this one definitely fits into the mold. But at the same time, you can't help but love it. Each character is stereotypical in his own way, and also forgettable if you watch the individual characters (the princess, the tsundere, the outgoing, etc). But taken together, with little idiosyncrasies in their stereotype, it makes for an excellent watch. The way the characters develop is fun as well-- it is both expected and unexpected, a mark of good storytelling. I chuckle often watching this. It also gets intense at all the right moments. I'm only at episode 11, but it seems like the characters get less and less stereotypical as time goes on.Further edit: I am now on Episode 20, and I retract what I said about the characters being stereotypical. They only seem that way at first. The character growth for the whole cast is phenomenal.Final edit (and change of 4 stars to 5): An emotional rollercoaster. I cried at the end (and I'm a guy) T_T I will never forget Taiga or Ryuji.",5
toradora,"I've watched a lot of anime on crunchyroll and this is my first time writing a review on one because I feel this anime deserves justice. It is everything I've wanted in an anime and not one character in the show whether they are the main character or side characters did I not like, everyone was lovable and unique.  I am a guy, and I can tell you this show evoked so many emotions and the latter half the show is when the show is really at its best. Every episode was enjoyable and not for one second was I bored. For those of you who are unsatisfied with the ending in the last episode wait till after the credits there's more to it. Overall this anime is in my top 5. I hope you'll enjoy it as much as I have.",5
toradora,"This was an absolutely excellent anime.  I laughed so hard through the earlier episodes.  My heart was tugged in the later episodes; some tears watered my face.  The character development was amazing and enchanting.  I usually don't watch things a second time because I tend to remember almost everything, but I may have to make an exception.  The ethical principles taught through the story-line (sacrificial love, honesty, true friendship, etc.) were beautiful as they were developed.  The characters really grow on you.  Good luck stopping once you start watching this!  This one is really easy to give 5 stars.  Enjoy!",5
toradora,okay. so the start had me a little bored... i stopped watching the anime multiple times just cause i got bored and was like... whats all the hype about... then couldnt get into it. but i got into it again for like the 5th time recently and finished it. AND HOLY FAIFHSISFNS THOSE LAST COUPLE EPISODES HAVE ME SHOOK!!!! IM WRITING THIS AFTER WATCHING IT AND MY MIND IS JUST BWAH! ITS SO FIAFBJDSF CUTE AND INNOCENT AND AAAAAAAAH!

toradora,"A beloved romantic comedy anime about two students that are labeled as delinquents by their fellow classmates and teachers, after a couple interactions together they find out they both have crushes on the other’s best friend. The odd duo work together to assist in their goals to gain the attention of their respective crushes. Toradora is as aforementioned a beloved anime by the community, I myself believe there are better romantic comedies out there, but this one still is very very good, make no mistake.",5
toradora,"Review in brief:  Toradora! is full of the usual highschool rom-com tropes and clichés, yet it not only succeeds but excels at nearly everything it works towards.  It doesn’t contain those tropes just because they’re standard; it knows how & why they were meant to be used in the first place and uses them to their fullest.  By tying them together with a strong central theme, Toradora! becomes an excellent journey crafted out of familiar story elements.Review in full:  The premise of Toradora! is simple; it’s a high school rom-com in which the main characters are trying to hook each other up with their best friends, as they each happen to have crushes on the other's friend.  It’s a premise that surprises nobody, and it doesn’t take much thought to correctly guess how things will end up.  If you don’t know who the main characters end up with by the end of episode 2 then you simply had to have missed something.  At this point Toradora! may sound like a waste of time, but that would be deciding that a cake tastes bad based only on its shape.  The “main romance” elements are basically given to the audience from the get-go because they are only a setup for the real goal of Toradora!, and that is to cultivate a character drama around the concept of self-honesty within the artificial world we know as “high-school”.It starts with the characters, both main & side. On the surface they are quite tropey and in many ways just what you’d expect out of this genre of anime. In this way they also tend to have exaggerated physical and emotional features, emphasizing their feelings and antics towards the other characters. However, in time it is shown that these “typical” behaviors are, much like the rest of high school society, a façade, within which vulnerable teenage self-identities hide in fear and feared personas are cast into by those less caring. These characters aren’t the standard templates they initially appear to be; they are actually defined by their thought processes and emotional reaction points. This refreshing form of characterization is the path that allows what at first is just a typical rom-com cast to grow into the central theme of self-honesty. It’s why the exaggerative covers are there in the first place; the slew of templated, cutout characters in anime’s ubiquitous high-school setting can easily give us viewers the depressing expectation that they’re almost all cover and no book.Toradora! also makes great use of its generic setting and story arcs therein.  It proudly features the anime-school staples: festivals, P.E. swimming, the beachside summer house, and a field trip so blatantly opposite to the norm that it’s a joke.  Unlike lesser school anime that merely use these to run their characters through the typical thematic jokes and leave it at that (“It’s high-school, surely you didn’t expect something different!”) Toradora! makes a point of using each situation to allow its characters to bond through necessitated teamwork, enter environments where they’re more willing to peel back their fronts a little, and create moments that snowball over the course of the show to become dramatic scenarios of their own later on.Because of this, no matter how predictable or generic the main story elements get, Toradora! is always able to deliver a dramatic experience, witty comedy, or even both at the same time via multi-layered character-driven interactions.  My only real complaint is that Kitamura's arc could have been handled better in regards to Kitamura's character and development feeling a little lacking up to that point, but it's nothing too serious and builds the setup for the rest of the show.Toradora! is also doubly entertaining, allowing it to appeal to a wide range of expectations.  Firstly, its pace is maintained via arcs of 2-3 episodes, long enough to make each arc matter without dragging any scenarios or plot elements out longer than necessary.  Secondly, it possesses a decidedly silly flavor of humor.  Most of Toradora!’s comedy doesn't derive from situations or misunderstandings between characters (as one would expect from the genre) but most often just the characters goofing around and having a good time, especially where the outwardly enthusiastic characters are involved.  Not that those other forms of comedy can’t be effective (otherwise one would think that they’d be far less common) but Toradora!’s comedy is innately refreshing.  By allowing the characters to simply act as they are within these silly moments instead of following a rigid joke scenario it fosters an air of genuineness that gives the whole show a special charm and occasionally even sees characters develop through comedy.Even the production values of Toradora! end up amounting to more than they initially appear.  With its clear and effective use of both color palettes and emotive animation to reflect each scene’s mood, the visual artistry does everything it needs to do  to make the end result shine.  Of particular note are the dramatic sequences with highly controlled frame-rates, emulating a live-action movie to great effect.  The sound (especially the voice acting) is just about a perfect match, with distinct and lively voice acting for nearly every character and catchy music that captures the mood from a high schooler’s mind noticeably well.Now it must be said that many people who dislike the show cite a disdain for Taiga's violent and reactive character.  If you don't like her it will likely detract from your enjoyment.  For me, having known people who were surprisingly similar was enough to accept her when she wasn’t likable and led to her growing on me over time, which seems to have been the author’s intention.  I can say with confidence that Taiga's character is exaggerated to the same degree as the other main characters and didn't come off as comically strange or unnatural to me like other violent tsun-type characters tend to.Verdict:  On the surface, Toradora! is a generic high-school rom-com with a standard premise and a cliché & predictable outcome.  Dig deeper and it discards those notions when it turns out to be an intricately developed character drama, complete with moments both tender and lighthearted.  It shows us that something doesn't have to be one-of-a-kind to be truly beautiful, special, or even unique.  At the end of the day the journey can mean as much as or even more than the destination it leads to.  That is Toradora! ~ a whimsical adventure in a familiar neighborhood.Side note:  This review, in part, was made to present the topics discussed in the MAL blog article “Toradora: Maturity and cliché” by Awesomecake with spoiler-free wording.  If you’ve already seen Toradora! and want to know more about its underlying themes I highly recommend giving her article a read.Link: https://myanimelist.net/blog.php?eid=769730",5
toradora,"Let me start out with the thing that will get me in the most trouble first, and trust me when I say, ""I can't believe I'm saying this"" but... I like the Dub for this show better...Still With me? Okay, lets move on to the actual review,I don't really like dishing out 5 stars, I feel like it's an improper statement for any show to say it is absolutely perfect. And Toradora, isn't perfect, just like any show; but unlike most shows, Toradora doesn't try to be perfect either. It goes out and flaunts its flaws just like the rest of the show in a way that makes it feel like reality. There's just enough cheese and embarrassment in this show to make you remember back to your crazy romances or crushes you had on girls/boys in high school or middle school. Each character throughout the series is given some pretty hard realistic scenarios in ways they deal with love, or how they approach complex social situations. and Each character feels alive in the ways they deal with those situations and each other. It leaves you unable to stop yourself from rooting for a pairing you having been pushing for all season. This show even manages to pull of the very minor Harem elements in the right ways, where each person feels like they have a shot, and though based off the opening and the shows cover image, the answer for who gets the title of ""Toradora best girl"" is pretty obvious for the get go, there are lots of moments where the show makes you doubt that will be the case, holding intrigue the whole way till the final episodes.The only things I'd comment on are very minor, and hardly worth mentioning, sometimes (though rarely) the comedy does feel a little slow, or certain situations forced, but this is rare and far in between, not really negatively impacting the show much at all.",5
toradora,"Toradora is the first Anime of the Romance genre I've watched, I was blown away. The characters are well developped and pleasant to the eye. The story gets to you, you feel a certain attachment to many of the characters, and everything that happen. There's no moment where everything feel unnatural, everything that happens feels so real.It is for me the best Romance Anime, and certainly one the the best overall.",5
toradora,"Toradora! Is a story about young love, the kind felt by those in highschool. While this might seem stereotypical, the story does more with the concept than I believe I have ever seen.In Toradora, the true focus is on the characterization. Our two main protagonists go from friends, eventually attempting to help one-another in their pursuits in love, and eventually end up more like family. All the while, the supporting cast makes itself heard. You see, unlike in most romantic shows of this nature, both main characters start the story in love with other characters (rather than with one-another). The way that they attempt to fulfill their love, and the struggles felt by those who know that their love should not be fulfilled, are all too bitter and sweet.You will laugh. You will cry. More importantly however, you will empathize with the characters on this show. You will see a story of bonds which are so strong that those affected are willing to give up on their own happiness and their own selfish loves, simply so that their loved ones might be happy with what is best for them. Don't go into this show looking to ""ship"" characters. That's not where this story excels, even though it is a romance at its heart. What is more important, in my view, is how our beloved characters grow and develop, coming to realize what is truly important to them and how to deal with their teenage emotions. In the end, this is a story about love, family, and about growing up. I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys romance, or to anyone who simply wants a fun story with interesting characters to light up their day.",5
toradora,"Toradora! is a far cry from the normal types of show I watch. This was actually my first romantic-comedy. I prefer fantasy or science fiction anime. Regardless, I was in a period where I didn't want to watch another of those categories. I decided to branch out and try another type of anime. That led me to this show. I heard good things about it so I gave it a shot. To put it simply, this show is a masterpiece. Toradora! is absolutely brilliant and amazing. The show creates a bond between the watcher and the reader. You find yourself rooting for about everyone that pops up on the screen. The characters are the strong point of the show and are incredibly well done. They are relatable and fun. No character is flat or stereotypical. As the show goes on, the characters noticeably mature and develop. I found myself enjoying everyones screen time.The interactions between the characters is amazing as well. The constant insults between Ryuji and Taiga or the way Ryuji and Taiga almost drool over their crushes are a blast to watch.  The plot was magnificent as well. Toradora! constantly sends you through all sorts of emotions. Some moments have you laughing and smiling while others have you crying. My only problem with the show was the ending. While I was satisfied with it, there are a couple of unanswered questions that will pop in you mind. This is a minor problem but worth mentioning all the same. It is by no means a bad ending, it just could have been better.  Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hide Still that kissing scene at the end was absolutely beautiful. I almost started crying. Overall, Toradora! is a well written show with amazing characters that make you actually care for them. It is a must see and has become one of my favorite anime of all time (Top 10). This was one of the most enjoyable anime I have ever watched. I recommend this show to anyone who has even the slightest interest in watching it.Overall Rating: 10/10",5
toradora,"Beautiful romance slice of life with comedic moments. My favorite of the genre to this day, just re-watched the whole thing in 2 days. The story starts with a guy living with his mom while he goes to high school, and his dads no longer in the picture so he kinda of takes care of his mom and cooks for her and what not, while she goes to work. Can't really say anything bad about the anime, just watch the first few episodes and before you know it ull be half way through the anime 10/10.",5
toradora,"Spoilers!!I love this anime, don't get me wrong. This is one of those animes that you watch when you wanna say ""awwwww"" and ""we all can see she loves him"" while eating popcorn. Just waiting for them to get together. I normally don't like animes that does'´t have any fantasy elements in it, but I do have some exceptions like this and some other dramas. So why four stars instead of five? I think some of the scenes would have been even more touching and strong if she would have not hit the boy. There could have been more times when Taiga  would have just took Ryuujis hand or stricken his hair instead of hitting air out of his lungs. Or held back. Besides after so many beatings he should already expect the punch... I kinda hopes for more growth in her way on dealing things. How at one point she would realize that she doesn't wanna hurt him. This is why I like the kissing scene. It is full on emotions. Fear of loosing watch other and hurting other people. Lust and love that they have for each other is innocent, but I don't know what they did after the cameras were of... It is quite common for these type of animes to show only one kiss but I am gonna say what everybody else is thinking... GIVE US MORE!!! Maby that is the romantic in me screaming, but still. The time when Ryuuji wanted to get away from home cause his mother collapsed of exhaustion and Taiga runs after him only caring about his needs showed how much Taiga loves him. She did not let go of his hand. At that time she supported him like he had supported her despite the violence and name calling. Am I happy that I have seen this anime? Yes.",5
toradora,"This is a series I have watched countless times, and on each rewatching I marvel at how well these characters are portrayed through the entire series. As a romance story, we all should know that the two titular characters Taiga (the TORA) and Ryuji (the DORA) end up falling in love. What fails in many romance anime series is when the love feels either rushed or left for the final 2 minutes of the series.Where this romance works is in the believable progression of the two. Going from partners to friends... eventually to lovers. It never felt forced nor did it feel like they were writing in ""conflicts"" to further push the dramatic envelope. I guess that's one of the pros when it comes to adapting Light Novels to anime rather than manga. In manga, they need to keep readers coming back each week... something that relies heavily on forcing at times useless conflict. That was never the case here.It felt organic, like it gave us the viewers ample time to come to terms with the overarching love story as well as gave the characters time to fall in love.In regards to the dub, I just finished watching the entire series dubbed... for the first time... and when it comes to my anime I am usually more inclined to go the subbed route over dub. The dubbed adaptation was surprisingly faithful to the original with a stellar cast that brought these characters to life just as wonderfully as the original Japanese. Cassandra Lee Morris was incredibly charming as Taiga and Erik Kimerer brought Ryuji to life better than I could have ever expected. The rest of the cast performed wonderfully with Johnny Young Bosche as Kitamura and Erika Harlacher as Ami; the one who really stole the dub for me was Christine Marie Cabanos as Kushieda! The character was super hyperactive with a personality that reflected in every word she said. While the amazing Yui Horie played Kushieda picture perfect in the original Japanese, Cabanos gave the character just as much character while maintaining everything that made Kushieda such a memorable part of the cast.Overall, this a picture perfect dub and as a whole... whether you want to watch it dubbed or subbed... this is an Anime that noone should ever miss.",5
toradora,"So personally, I used to dislike the Rom-Com genre. But Toradora helped change my mind. It gave me laughs and made me cry. The intro to this series was great and helped me get an understanding of each of the characters quite quickly. Even though I could guess the outcome of the show, I really appreciated the way details changed how I connected with it. Overall this anime helped change my view on Rom-Coms for the better, and I would suggest it to anyone who likes Romances, Comedies, or Slice of Life genres.",5
toradora,"I had been hearing about Toradora for years.  Really, who hadn’t?  However it had never quite made its way to my “To Watch” list.  Something to get around too one day…maybe, but nothing that had really been overly special that demanded that I see it soon.  So there it sat in the back of my mind from when I had first heard about it in 2009.  Fast forward to about a year ago and two reviewers, whose links I will post at the end of the review, posted their opinions.  They were Former D2 Brigade members, for any of the old fan base out there who remembers one of the more fun collectives of reviewers, Professor Otaku and Arkada.  I am subscribed to both on YouTube and donate to both or their Patreons throughout 2015.  I have, overall, trusted their opinions and will say rarely have they swayed me wrong.  Both have very different personalities, but have seemed to agree, for the most part, on whether or not a series was good, even if they didn’t personally like it themselves.  It came as an interesting shock then when I saw their respective reviews for Toradora and saw that their opinions be not be any more different.  Arkada praised Toradora, and said it had a nearly perfect ending, wonderful characters, and a great story.  Prof, however, saw things as very differently talking about the lack of originality, how many of the characters fell into tropes (or were completely unlikable), and stated that while better than many shows in the Slice of Life genre was still not good simply because just stuck to the overall formula not going at all of center.  Suddenly this series rose to the top of my list with the thought of which one of them I was going to find myself agreeing with.  In the end it was both.Toradora is a good show, however, like Prof, I do not understand the rankings of eights, nines, and tens that it receives.  If I were to rate it on a ten point scale would be a solid six point five or seven depending on the mood I’m in when I see it.  That is far from saying its bad however I do not see what the great hype is about.  Again I find myself agreeing with Prof that Tiga is a little, and I quote, “stink bug”, but at the same time I will agree with Arkada in saying that here character is a well done version of a Tsundere.  In fact a nearly perfectly done version of one.  Like Arkada I find myself thinking that the characters are very well done and will say that they are one of the better portrayals of the seventeen year olds.  From the pranks they play on each other at the beach house, to the way they argue, bicker, and try to change themselves, the shallowness of those final teenage years are captured perfectly.  It was so bizarre that after I watch the series through the first time I found myself noting how well the two of them captured my opinion of the show.  I agree with Prof that I it does not take too many chances and it suffers from that.  I agree with Arkada that the story that is told is well done and that the end game story is a nearly perfect ending.  In the end I find myself being the middle man of hatred and love for a show and saying this:  Toradora is overhyped.  The characters are archetypes and do not break the mold but do manage to do very subtle variations.  I love how Ryuji looks like a thug, but he really is just a nice guy neat freak.  I love how Tiga is supposed to be adorable, but is such a raging b.  Still they are archetypes that while there are those little differences they do not go that far off model.  They are cookie cutter characters thrown into off cookie cutter bodies.  Minori is probably the most interesting one of the batch and that maybe because of the fact that she is so off kilter like so many teenagers are.  The plot, once again does do nothing too unique.  The story arcs are fun and flow from one to the next with ease, and do so well, but it is a still cookie cutter.  Here we see all of the tropes of the Slice of Life Romantic Comedy.  Once again though I do find one thing that was very brave and that was while the plot and the outcome are quite easy to predict how they get there and the reactions of the characters is somewhat different.  These are not as Prof points out, what people think people act like from second hand, but instead what a group of teenage kids really are like.  So while the outcome and the stories might be predictable the journey there is not.  Instead of taking the interstate we get the back roads and see character times that we know entering all too well known events in a fun way of real people.  Is everything realistic?  HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!  Not on your life, but are they real enough to be relatable?  I’d say so.  Overall the story, the characters and the animation is really good, but not everything that it is hyped up to be.  Those reading this may notice I gave it four stars out of five.  I have a hard time with the five star scale so allow me to add it would be three out of four for my mindset.  I like the series and I wish to own it now, but it is not the Masterpiece that so many claim it to be.

toradora,"This anime will keep you laughing and having a good time through the first 20 or so episodes. The last ones will hit you right in the feels but they are good emotions, I swear. The first episode was interesting but nothing that would instantly pull you in. Ryuji seemed like a very classic, over-used and mundane character at first. You know, the boy with those ""killer-eyes"" that wasn't really popular in school. The writers steer him out of that light rather quickly and give him the recognition he truly deserved and you root for him all the way though ! I'm glad to have stuck through with the anime after hearing of it though. The progression in the anime is amazing and at just the right pace. I loved all the major characters; Ryuji, Taiga, Minori, Ami and Yusaku. The supporting characters, Ya-chan, Haruta, Noto and Inko-chan even were a real pleasure to have as well. I've never said that about an anime before and in fact, most shows leave me hating the majority of characters. If you're looking for a fun anime packed with laughter and feels, Toradora! will definitely not disappoint.",5
toradora,I think this is the best romance anime ever. It just shows us that love can come in any shape or form no matter how it starts off. I think this anime can give many people hope. It shows us that there is someone out there for everyone as long as they are treated the way they like to be treated. Just be patient and you can end up as happy as Ryujji Takasu and Taiga Aisaka! I really wish for a second season. I do not have the words to recommend this as much as possible so please watch it.,5
toradora,"Toradora! seems to capture the essence of how a teenager dreams about romance, without seeming too philosophical or wise beyond his/her years. Occasionally, Toradora! has some sober moments that hint at a deeper message into self-love and accepting yourself for your flaws while acknowledging that you should work on yourself; be happy. That being said, this is a more mature version of slap-stick comedy and it doesn't seem to take itself too seriously. The audience sees some #animelogic like how Yasuko doesn't seem to age over the twenty year flashbacks that the producers show. Toradora! has a good balance between the sober moments and more humorous and light side to being a teenager. I enjoyed the dynamic character development. TL;DR: Must watch anime because it's just really good. ∩(︶▽︶)∩",5
toradora,"This anime is awesome (in my opinion) it takes place at a school where Tiger and Dragon meet each other AKA , Taiga Aisaka and Ryūji Takasu meet . The story goes through their school life Taiga has a crush on a guy at the school so she gets Ryūji to help her get him , but eventually she realizes that she loves Ryūji and that Ryūji loves her and then it ends . its awesome and great for a family to watch (if you can get past the language and perverted things ) other than that its a series that will leave you with your heart in shambles and you wondering if there is more to the story than is shown .",5
toradora,"Romance is an extremely common genre in pretty much every medium; well, except for maybe MMA. With a market so flooded with cheaply made cash grabs that are made about as well as a Chinese motorcycle, it's nice to see something genuinely enjoyable for a change. My only real complaint is that the ending gets a little weird around the last five minutes of the episode, but thankfully everything works out and the show has a nice succinct finale.",5
toradora,"Toradora! is why you watch slice-of-life shows. It's relatable, its surprisingly funny, the art is beautiful, and it revolves around a wonderful blossoming relationship. 100% recommend to anyone looking for a light-hearted show with some bittersweet undertones. Characters - They are all very watchable, but not believable at times. Many of the characters seem very one-sided, but throughout the show they become more visibly complex and human. Plot - This is a pretty typical layout for the slice-of-life genre. You get a festival, a vacation scene, pool scene, as well as others. As predictable as it may seem, the comedy and subtle romantic progression keeps this show rolling steadily and makes it very watchable. Fighting - It's a slice-of-life so don't expect much but the fighting is actually pretty good. Each movement has meaning, impact, and flows well. Emotional Investment - This is about 80% why you watch the show. In the beginning, you know it's going to happen, but it's a beautiful process. Each of the characters has someone in mind and our protagonist not surprisingly (that's one thing I don't like) gets everyone to fall in love with him, but he makes his choice later on. Sooner or later you start to identify with the characters and their reasons for the choices they make, and it becomes nostalgic to watch because of the high school setting. This is the whole reason the slice of life genre exists, is to do what this show does. Comedy - ABSOLUTELY HILARIOUS. It's pretty rare but when it happens it's killer. Seriously laugh-out-loud-like-nobody-else-can-hear-you funny. The timing is spot on and many if not all of these have huge replay value. Clichedness - Like I said before the plot is cliched as anything but it doesn't take away from the substance of the show which is the character development and romance progression. The one-sidedness of the characters does certainly seem cliched but they open up to the camera later which makes them more relatable. Dub - 10/10 the first and only dub i've actually genuinely enjoyed. the voices perfectly fit the characters and it helped to get me invested in the show more.",5
toradora,"I went into this show with low expectations, just thinking it'd be another High School drama where the main character is crushing on a girl who's wayyyyy out of his league. I came out with mouth agape. This show totally blew my expectations out of the water and set the bar. The final episodes, after ### and ### kissed was just outright adorable, ""1 more."", ""Okay, 1 more."", ""1 more."" I started tearing up on the final episode, the twist got me hard. I'm so glad I watched till after the credits, I left happy. I definitely recommend this show to people who enjoy Romantic-Comedies.This show definitely needed an OVA, just imagine it, it shows the two lovers all grown up, with kids, sweet, adorable kids. It would leave the show with a sound ending, and not leave most people, like me, in the end with tear filled eyes.",5
toradora,"My First Review:Well, here it goes..! In this anime you can really see how real friends should be like, same time you're having an amazing experience and idea how really is the world out there and how people act in many central situations via difficulties of life. This anime carries a deep meaning to it, you shout never criticize someone from how he look or how powerful he's cause we're all humans and out hearts are frangible. You shout never play with someones emotions NEVER cause someday your turn will come to face this challenges...Am not a professional at writing reviews but that's what came out from my chest and what I really feel and understood from this anime",5
toradora,"Wow. Where to begin. Toradora is the best romantic anime I've ever seen. Not to mention one of my favorite anime of all time. The comedy never ends, and there are some moments that could make even the most cold-hearted person crack a giant smile. The relationship between Taiga and Ryuuji is adorable, and leads to some very funny and silly shenanigans. The development is great, and the ending kinda tricks you into watching after the credits *wink wink* *nudge nudge*. Just do yourself a favor, and watch this show, I'm certain you won't regret it.",5
toradora,"Well i knew the name and i knew the music but i had no idea what i was walking into when i started watching this ....YESTERDAY! and now its gone (╥_╥)﻿I was ready to throw Toradora to the wind and go back to watching some (mindless) male protagonist destroy hopelessly outmatched opposition (+/- a sword) but within the first 15 minutes i knew id be watching all of this though it pains me to admit it.It has some great comedy and the emotional roller coaster can reduce some to tears.....obviously that didn't happen to me (╥_╥)﻿ #PoolAccident I'll admit that its predictable in places but in many ways i felt that made me want to get to the end and see it all play outIts well worth a watch and has snuck onto my list of favorites ""lost my pieces"" from the OST brings it ALL backas the title suggest MORADORA NAOW PLEEZ",5
toradora,"I just had a few episodes left of Toradora to finish as I was recovering from a cold going around, and I have to say I am definitely surprised and strangely emotional after finishing it tonight. I want to state at the top of this review that this is not my genre of preference, and that I have mostly stayed clear of anime since 2007 until a recent and most welcome return. If you need a quick answer, yes, Toradora! is absolutely worth your time and investment. Below I provide some reasons why.One of the biggest reasons I have resisted anime that can be described as ""slice-of-life"" or ""high school romance"" (I just made up that phrase but you know what I mean) is the inevitable paperthin plot and dependent conflicts. I can't say I am an older viewer, exactly, but high school was never so dramatic or one-dimensional as the setting of Toradora!. I must admit that watching the series straight through, binging on the episodes by myself probably caused me more grief than necessary, because I tired of some of the conventions of the plot and the characters. It can wear on anybody, especially because these stories have been told before. What makes Toradora! special is ""how"" it tells its story.From a character perspective, although not entirely original, the cast is easy to fall in love with and think about when you are not watching Toradora!. It might be a deal-breaker for some of you to read reviews that say that the characters are fairly generic, and I wouldn't blame you. What separates Toradora! from its competitors are the voice acting and certain power episodes where the animation jumps into overdrive. The voice actress of Taiga does a great job in general, but at times delivers a performance that is...very, very effective? (lol, I mean moving...tear-jerking, seriously). In general, the actors/actresses have great chemistry in this series, that elevates these characters into a definitely exceptional romance anime. As a YouTube reviewer (Glass Reflection) carefully noted, the ending of Toradora! is much better than most that tell this kind of story, but personally I found myself looking at the endings of different narratives of the Toradora! universe, and found satisfaction and peace (such as the ending of the PSP game and visual novel). Much like how anime is produced and consumed today, the full story of Toradora! is not contained in just these 25 episodes but also the visual novels and the manga. Thumbs up, Toradora! will definitely linger in my memory!",4
toradora,"I am very critical of the shows that I watch and the books that I read.  I rarely write reviews.  Nonetheless, I felt that this was worth taking a few moments to share my two cents. First, I'm a guy.  Over twenty years military and a college degree.I loved the character development in this story.  The male and female leads where both very strong and neither one overshadowed the other.  I could have watched a few seasons of this and not found myself bored.  I had mixed feelings about the conclusion.  My first reaction was that I didn't like the way that it ended.  However, the more I thought about it from the perspective of the characters.  I feel that what they did was very much consistent with their respective characters.  It was by no means a bad ending at all.I will say this that despite anyones opinion of the shows conclusion this is one story that is worthy of your time even if you find yourself with mixed feelings regardings its ending.  I feel that it was time well spent.",5
squishy-black-clover,"Squishy! Black Clover is a comedic spinoff of Black Clover with a Cute Chibi-Style, similar to Petit Clover. Episodes are 9 minutes long. Story summary: The unknown Culprit starts turning Black Bull members into Mechas, who is the culprit?All 8 episodes were pretty hilarious, breaking 4th wall at times and switching art style. Opening is sick btw.Quote of Yuno letting the feelings out:a ""cool"" character isn't allowed to talk too much! They can only mutter now and then, and they have to say something cool when they do! I rarely get to put my intelligence to use or show off how smart I really am. Also, why the hell is my catchphrase ""You can't be serious""?! Can't I say something longer? Then I'd have more lines and be able to talk more often!

squishy-black-clover,"Funny take on the petit clover format fun to watch a bit eccentric nothing too serious, the style is of course downgraded compared to the principal anime, but it's normal for the format and type of anime, I enjoyed it. It's not for everyone taste but it has his own merit and those who compare because of ""animation quality"" definitely don't know this is a style of animation for those types of spin off comedic show.",5
squishy-black-clover,"-First of all, did they not get that the original Black Clover filler was  HORRIBLE in the first place? Everyone hated it. But guess what? THEY MADE AN ENTIRE SERIES ON IT! -The opening is basically just reused animations from the official anime. Unless you didn't realize that the characters are chibis, only 3 seconds of the OP has them as they are in the anime (3 seconds of chibi Asta and Yuno). The rest of it is just them actually looking decent-ish. As good as you may think the OP sounds like, if you don't watch it until the end or you've never watched Black Clover at all, it's the most deceiving thing that ever exists. That's all to my TedTalk",5
squishy-black-clover,"Who takes an anime notorious for obnoxious characters and little to no pliot and says, you know what this needs? To be MORE annoying . It feels like filler intended to waste users subscription charges. Astas was already about as loveable as nails down a chalkboard ass is, WITH HIS CONSTANT SHOUTING, then you decided we needed to be subjected to it more for even less purpose. 1 star cause it won't let me rate half",1
squishy-black-clover,"It's hard to really give it five stars. It does what it says it would, but the animation style really makes it difficult to watch. Most powerpoint animations have more dynamic movement than this seems to. The faces are static, and flash between two stages continuously, there's a lot of sliding animations, and in general, this looks like it could have been produced in a few days by a single bored intern. The writing is okay, but boils down each character into their tropes even more than the original series.That opening, however, really prevents me from being able to give it one star. It seriously trumps every OP that the original series had, which is an absolute shame, seeing as this side series really doesn't deserve such a high quality OP.",1
classroom-of-the-elite,"It as all of the clichés of your high school anime. You have a monotone main character, a tsundere girl, the popular girl, and the non-existence of parents. Also, it as a similar yet fantastic atmosphere to season 1 of My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU, another great show. There is a twist to the show though. The main character might talk awkwardly, but he is observant, thoughtful, highly apathetic/pessimistic, yet at the same time wants to make friends. The tsundere girl has an insecurity issue, which she makes up for by isolating herself from everyone else. Unlike a typical tsundere character who is usually just violent or a narcissist. The popular girl is a kind person who gets along with most of the class rather than being unkind to those below her. The lack of parents cliché is explained for once, as they are isolated in a government-run program that makes them live away from family. The unique twists of your slice of life make it enjoyable to watch.TL;DR - Unique twist on high school slice of life shows and fascinating atmosphere.",4.5
classroom-of-the-elite,"This show revolves around a advanced high school and the students are to stay within the school area. In the beginning each student is alloted 100,000 points which equates to 100,000 yen to spend on for the month inside the school. The MC is very analytical and observant; but also monotonous. Judging from the first episode he is going to be the epicenter of how to solve class 1-D's financial problem with the help of Hirikita-san *spoiler*(They were alloted 0points as a class due to showing no merit which case the teacher told them the first day of class resulting to their class being as she said, ""Garbage."".).",5

Broad Description:If you liked Fruit of Grisaia, I feel like you might like this too. The main characters so far have been fantastic! The dialogue is fantastic; art and animation are very solid.  Fan service isn't distasteful for the most part. There might be some that might make the sensitive ones to it uncomfortable, but it didn't bother me and actually contributed to some characters' development later, besides the usual ""character development"". I'll go into spoiler territory for that later.Specifics Description:The world-building is well done; plot progression stays consistent; Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideThe only main real problem is that this show introduces far too many characters that don't get fully fleshed out or exist solely as a trope with no deviations. I understand that this is actually beneficial to how the main characters are portrayed and how they stand out from the rest of the cast, but the bar that they set up for the cast is too low in my opinion. The main character seems a bit too overpowered, but it's not bothersome. I've seen far more overpowered MC. The reason why I feel like he's overpowered is that I never felt like he was close to being expelled. There has been the threat of expulsion on him, but I never felt like there wasn't a problem where he couldn't solve it. For the fan service part I mentioned earlier, There have been 4 parts that I can remember as being fan service. Two of them differ from the usual fan service. You'll know which ones they are, because few shows actually pull off similar parts like this show did, Fruit of Grisaia being one.",5

classroom-of-the-elite,"Fake enthusiasm!Classroom of The Elite is the most surprising of the season, not because of the twists (which there are), but because of how much I liked it. At first glance I thought it was going to be an almost interesting show that I was going to enjoy for the fact of filling time for not thinking of the emptiness that is life. But turns ou-Nvm idc just try out the first 3 episodes if you're hooked you're hooked. I like it a wee bit too much, you should also. :D(Also favorite new series not counting second seasons and the such, shout out to the homie BNHA.)",5

It's a classical high school slice of life, with the harem for the mc, the fan service, the school life, the tsundere girl, the big boobs.Should we call it overpowered mc? We could I guess. Even if the mystery around him remains.You can compare it to other shows that contain all this and say if it meets up or not or that it's stereotype and boring cause we've all seen it before.But I dont think comparisions count for anything when you're spellbound to just plow through the episodes (all but maybe ep 7 wich seemed to be mostly a fan-service filler) to find out how it's gonna end and what's actually going on.The plot and story is made to keep you guessing and being intrested and they've done it well.When I've watched all episodes and just want more, I'm not going to compare the show to all the others or start nitpicking at it. I'm going to admit it was a good one.",4

classroom-of-the-elite,"The premise behind this anime was fantastic, and I loved how the opening crawl of each episode (quoting people such as Nietzsche) helped to give a basis behind the theme of each episode.That being said, the show began to go on a downward spiral around episode 7, when it seemed to care more about fan-service then the plot itself. And I get it; showing off the occasional boob or butt shot is just something one has to accept when it comes to anime. But to dedicate an entire episode to it? In an anime series that is attempting to come across as serious? It just ruined the entire pacing of the show, and the second half of the season never really recovered.Is it worth a watch? Maybe. I havent read any of the light novel that this is based on, so I can't comment on whether a second season would be worth watching or not (nor do I know if there even is a second season coming). It has some interesting themes, and if you can get past the fan-service, then this might be worth your time",4
classroom-of-the-elite,"when i started Classroom of the Elite, i thought the premise was interesting. a few episodes in, and it was fun to discuss theories on the forums since we didnt know everything about the school and the system yet. but for me, as the season went on, i just found myself asking ""why do i even care?"" and answering ""i guess i really dont"". the story sets up classes basically trying to outsmart each other to gain points. but i was not entertained or impressed by how things turned out. the storytelling was too contrived.",5
classroom-of-the-elite,"This is not a typical school anime (of course non of them are..), it's a bit like Guilty Crown mixed with that ""bad grade bad habitat"" series that you have to fight for As to live a first class life, you get it, ""first class"" AHAhaha.. aww mmkay move on.  After you withnessed the worst explanation ever, lets jump into the rating pool!The characters were written good and their sides, characteristics and secrets were introduced to us in a right way at the right time and there is enough misteries left for a second season. The art is nothing special, a normal not eyecandy but still good.  The story is kind of irrelevant, you want to uncover it but nothing special that would blow your mind.  Story: 4/5  Art/animation: 4/5  Voice acting: 5/5And I gave it a 5/5, because it is a good show after all.",5
classroom-of-the-elite,"I wasn't expecting much, but this show ended up being excellent. There's a few things holding it back from 5 stars for me, mostly the fact certain aspects felt inconsistent to me, like its supposed to be a high school anime but there are 10th graders with character designs that make them look easily over 30. A lot of the characters have behavior that doesn't make sense for high school as well.However the setup is really intriguing and I want to see a second season.",4.5
classroom-of-the-elite,"Amazing anime one of the best ever aired in my opinion.  It is defiantly a action, romance, anime filled with lots of attention grabbers.  Season 2 has to be made. With all the excitement and adrenaline that this anime causes is awesome.  This anime knows how to get you on the edge of your seat.  I would really recommend it to anyone who enjoys anime in general.  It is amazing and as to bee seen by everyone. It is to bad that some feelings weren't really said but hopefully season will be aired and solves this mysterious cliff hanger about Ayanokoji. (main character)",4.5
classroom-of-the-elite,"The show begins right off the bat with high-tension and interesting characters. The beginning arcs are stellar with awesome development and scene building. You can feel the stakes rising with every episode but then you get an infamous anime pool episode where the stakes drop off entirely. Don't get me wrong, it's completely fine to have a laid back breather in a show, the problem lies in what happens after. Basically, the show never really picks back up for me. It wasn't a ""Masamune Kun's Revenge"" tier bad ending... but I'm still a bit disappointed at where it ended up. Fun watch, don't get too invested. 6.5/10",5
classroom-of-the-elite,"Classroom of the elite season one feels like a huge cliffhanger for season two.A distant main character, seemingly bored, but very full of himself isn't a new concept for a main character, see:death note, code geass, and one of my personal favorites (tho I only read the manga) : kamisama no iutoori /kamisama no iutoori ni Everyone who enjoyed the before mentioned titles should give ""Classroom of the elite"" a shot.",5
classroom-of-the-elite,"These characters are flawed, but that's the point.  They are also reflections of Japanese society - and that's also the point.""Deru kugi wa utareru"" - the nail that sticks out gets hammered.  Everyone in this series is flawed in some way and this takes its time to explain those flaws, but does it in a way that is believable despite the idea of such an apparently rich and powerful school.  The ideas portrayed (payment for value, focus on talent, learning how others work, etc.) are all requirements for functioning in Japanese adult life.  Is one better than the other?If you're paying attention, this is a primer on how children should grow into responsible adults - while showing off all the potential pitfalls (in the form of other characters) that can come your way...Good on multiple levels, with characters you can relate to and care for.",5
classroom-of-the-elite,"This anime offers a slice of existentialism rather than life. From Jean-Paul Sartre to La Rochefoucauld, I love how philosophy is used in this modern-age show that depicts reality; inequality, the plight of people to transcend how others describe and rank you, to the impermanence of life and titles in general. The duality of character, the faces you wear and how you are perceived by others as a determining of your character are all relevant and present here. It offers a unique plot line, and an intriguing twist that distinguishes itself from your run-of-the mill anime. I like it a lot.",5
classroom-of-the-elite,"Hoping for a season 2! This anime breaks from the typical lame MC who's there to please everyone, he is extremely intelligent and does what needs to be done to protect himself. The whole aspect of the show revolves around being cunning and outsmarting your opponents. The Mystery of the MC is what makes this show so great, and makes you want to know more about him, and his past. I'm really hoping for a season 2, the ending definitely gave me chills, and has me seriously curious how the MC develops, or changes as he interacts with more of his classmates.",5

classroom-of-the-elite,I started watching this series with just a little bit of interest in the was it was described. I didn't think I would watch this series to completion. Boy am I glad I gave Classroom of the Elite a chance. I know I will finish this season and hope for another. There is just the right amount of intrigue to make you want the next episode to come around quickly.The character development is deep and the interactions are realistic. At least as realistic as anime can be. The story development makes you wonder how things will go next week and the next. I highly recommend this anime.,3
classroom-of-the-elite,"> solid premise> main character is actually a wooden block> main girl is also a wooden block> dialogue is clunky at best and cringy at worst> opening theme song and OP are just not appealing to me> art is nice, but there's nothing spectacular> character designs are also nice, if not somewhat generic> pacing is quite poortldr; This show tries to be more intellectual than it actually is; which is a boring and somewhat generic high school show. It makes you think it has something to say about humanity when it actually doesn't",5
classroom-of-the-elite,This anime is extremely interesting watch for me purely based on the fact that this would be a great experiment to see happen in real life with how money and having access to everything a person could possibly want would affect how they treat their real life responsibilities. Plus the characters look like they have quite a few layers to them which will be fun to watch assuming they expand into their personalities.,4
classroom-of-the-elite,"I saw the announcement, read what is about, saw the promos(including the one on anime expo) and finally saw the first episode and safe to say, this is what a really good light novel adaptation is all about. the animation graphics is smooth and beautiful, the soundtrack and background music fits well, the voice casts are good, and last but not least, storyline is great. i cant wait for next week or the next episode. and it makes me want to buy the light novel. my rate is a whopping 5 out of 5.",5
classroom-of-the-elite,"Kiyotaka Ayanokoji Talks slowly with disinterest, but according to his continuous self-dialog, he cares but cannot express it.  He, unfortunately, is sitting next to the most paranoid and schizoid girl, Horikito, in his class. The different personalities of their classmates are distinct, if not a parody, of Japanese dysfunction. They have the rich narcissistic boy; the pandering girl that wants to be liked by everyone; a number of superficial, self-involved teenagers; the angry guy that sleeps in class; most of whom abuse the system in various ways.  They are guests of an elite, government supported, academy that pays them a stipend according to their worth as people.  Which over the first month =0. ""You are garbage"", said the teacher.  And, thus the tale begins. The plot is good, as is the somewhat trite character development. The animation, apparently done by a Viet Namese company, is also quite good.  Despite its naivete', the anime enjoyable to watch,  I find myself rooting for the protagonist.  I episode #3, the characters have become much more than their stereotypes, ending my only objection to the series.  It's now showing good character development in ways that you wouldn't expect. It's turned into an excellent series!",4.5
classroom-of-the-elite,"So many shows are about overpowered protagonists always winning through the sheer power of plot contrivances. Classroom of the Elite, on the other hand, starts with a bunch of good-for-nothing kids who screw themselves over early on and suddenly find themselves staring down expulsion and having their lives ruined forever. What's clever is how they work together (or not) to pick up the pieces and actually start to do well, perhaps even overtake the top class! A nice change of pace, intellectually, and even motivational, to prove that just because you messed up once, you aren't doomed to eternal failure.",4.5
classroom-of-the-elite,"Every time I feel like I have a grasp on what the show is about, the new character insights throw me off and I'm here like ""oh shi*t."" But for a 12 episode piece, it does its job by keeping you hooked the whole time. At first, I was a bit annoyed that so many episodes were dedicated to  underwear, but it was genius at the end. I would've liked if they developed the ending scene and set it up to be longer- it would have more of a shock effect then. But otherwise, I have been persuaded to start the manga.",3
classroom-of-the-elite,"From what you've seen you might've thought its one of those cheap animes that just follow the stream of new shows that gets puched back, but in reality yeah it is.The best thing about this anime is the drama. i personally think that it is very well made, also the way where they seperated the ""ELITE"" students into many clases and not just your typical class with all these charecters that you get to see everyday. Full of mysteries would give it a 8/10. untill i keep up with the manga i might change or update my review.",5
classroom-of-the-elite,"Classroom of the Elite is one of those anime's you watch and just get mesmerized after watching the first 2 episodes. The anime was beautifully constructed from just 3 out of the growling list of light novels being produced. What is also a big thing to see comparing to other anime's is the amount of VA's they put into this. In guessing, I believe there is over 20 voice actors in this anime just in the Japanese alone. With the dubbed, there is around over 40! With it also being held with No Game No Life, I believe this was one of the greatest anime's in the 2017 year. This anime was one of the best with bringing in a Typical Slice of Life School anime's. But let's be real, nothing of this school is anything from Ordinary. Hoping for Season 2!",5
classroom-of-the-elite,"I guess I can understand why most people like this, but it's frankly boring to me. I disliked most if not all of the main cast and shows like this live and die on the viewer liking the characters. To be fair I never got to far into the show, but I didn't like what I saw from spoilers either. Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hide also the ending is a WTF a bit. So Mc has no attachment to anyone and is going to betray them and use them?",4
classroom-of-the-elite,"I truly enjoyed watching this anime and believe that it needs a SEASON 2 soon because of the many mysteries still left and the story arc seeming to have just truly begun. The plot of this anime is very intriguing and it keeps the viewer in constant interest and intrigue as to what will happen next. This is still much of the story left and I think that this anime can really go far and make it places. It has a little bit of everything without overdoing it. I really hope that another season is made and more if possible, I believe at least 3 seasons can be made one for each year of their journey. The anime has so much potential right now I would hate for it to go unproduced or for it to not be attained to it's full potential.  SEASON 2 is a necessity for this anime.",5
classroom-of-the-elite,"Love the characters, especially the unreliable narrative we get from our main character. Wish it ended more conclusively, since theres a lot of loose ends to tie up, but I guess season 2 will do that. I know about the light novels but some parts don't line up entirely with the anime's storyline so I don't want to go to that for all my questions. So I guess it's the waiting game until season 2...[spoilers ahead-]I really like the slow shift of your stereotypical ""she's got more than she'll letting on, thinks ten steps ahead"" character, to her becoming arguably one of the more normal characters, a lonely girl who just wants her brother to accept her and some friends. Meanwhile, your typical ""ditzy, friends with everyone"" girl has far more behind her back that we don't know about yet. I really hope we get more of her story next season, and of course more of our MC. I especially love the slow shift of our perspective through his narration, starting with him just being an awkward kid who could barely introduce himself to becoming so much more.",5

He is a quiet and unassuming guy who isnt good at making friends and would rather keep his distances. He is also a students of D class. which is a lower class.. there is a bunch more detail but i dont know how to put it in words.I dont know what to say but this is an ]AMAZING SHOW YOU HAVE TO WATCH....... ok. if you are reading this... im just telling you i am really bad at putting things in words.. so the show is way better then it sounds",5
classroom-of-the-elite,"The only thing I can say is that this show is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! I love the art, the attitude, and the suspense of waiting for the next episode to just hurry up and start already. The are characters I hate, and there are characters I love - Ayanokouji Kiyotaka -, but the important thing is to just enjoy what the producers have to offer. I REALLY HOPE there is a season 2 coming out. This show touched my emotions in every way. THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",5
classroom-of-the-elite,"This Anime was actually one of the last on my list.  But out of boredom I checked it out a bit early.  I wasn't disappointed and wished I had seen it sooner.  Such a variety of characters.  Nothing of what I expected (BETTER).  The series has a slow flow but it leaves you wanting more... I mean literally, the last episode ends so epic you know they HAVE to either make a second season or a 2 hour movie.  They can't do that to us!!!!",5
classroom-of-the-elite,"I didn't get into ""Classroom of the Elite"" until the second time I tried watching it, but I'm glad I went back and continued to watch.  This is definitely a show that deserves a second season. All the characters are interesting, making me invested and wanting to see them developed more.  The mystery element of the story adds to the depths of the characters as well.  ""Classroom of the Elite"" deserves more recognition than it does and I have nothing but praise for it.",4.5
classroom-of-the-elite,"I actually watched the Anime first and really liked it. I read the Manga and was very disappointed. They changed so many scenes. Ichinose from class B played such an important role in helping D Class with the security camera scene early in the show. Sudo and his troop of friends got so much action time, I did not even see the Pool scene as well as the volleyball scene in the manga. Lastly Horikita got so much more time then a lot of the other girls Airi Sakura, Ichinose, Kei karuzawa, Kushida. The Creator of the Light Novel as well as manga writer are very disappointed/angry in how the anime went. A lot of Japanese fans are angry. Will unlikely be a 2nd season for this show, they may as well redo it since it does not have Japanese support.",4.5
classroom-of-the-elite,"Hm... Without giving too much away, one thing that I really liked about the story is character interaction. I think this show has a lot of interesting characters. Not to say the characters I'm referring to are all likeable (I mean, they are to me), but I think there are many characters in this story that have some depth to them and are well thought-out. One of the recurring themes in the show is that most people have something they are trying hide, and this truth is exposed multiple times throughout the season. It makes me more interested because I want to see even more characters who weren't shown much in the this first season come to light. And of course, I want to see what happens to the main characters.",5
classroom-of-the-elite,This anime is a gem as far as I am concerned the main male and female are a great duo the characters are likable less so than some other anime I have seen but enough to keep me engaged my biggest problem with this series is that I want more to me this feels like a show that had a great first season good characters a good hook and twist on high school life  with a main character that we could follow and watch grow but were missing the seconds season the first season did a great job letting us know what the school was like what was expected of the students and what our main goal was to reach class A that is great now let see a season two more focused on the class D student lets see our main male open up let see them learn that he is there key but he is of no use to them if he only sees them as tools lets watch as they play mid games with each other and the other classes to reach the top and lets see any emotional pay off to a damaged character that could be changed in to some one we all love and root for not because he is winning all the time and we know he is the smartest person in the room but because we followed him through his hardships and came out the other end knowing that he has changed and though he may be defected he is not a tool molded by others,2
classroom-of-the-elite,"It's a very good anime if you like intrigues and mind-games. Who tricks who? One of the best anime I've seen for quite some time.Reason for this, is the characters and plot. The plot is quite simple in surviving the ""Elite School"", however, the way it is done is very well made. The characters are strong and well written, especially the main character, even though that much isn't revealed about him. I do hope we get a 2nd season. Also, I wish more anime had this type of plots and protagonists.",5
classroom-of-the-elite,"Classroom of the Elite is a psychological drama, set in a state-of-the-art prestigious high school where nearly 100% of the students after graduation go on to university or find employment. Our story focuses on the students of classroom D, one thing to note is that at this school, students are given a virtual currency that they can do anything with and are given a certain amount each month based on the class's overall performance at all times. The classes are rated from A to D based on this system. Ergo class D is in trouble.This show is basically a huge piece on equality in society and stuff like that. It's good, but not my cup of tea though, if you liked SNAFU, and want something somewhat like that with raised ""stakes,"" you'll most likely get something Classroom of the Elite.",5
classroom-of-the-elite,"This is probably one of the best 12 episode anime's I've seen in a long time. For anyone who's a fan of anime's such as Code Geass, Death Note, FMAB or any other anime's with a genius level protagonist who's always 2 steps ahead I highly recommend watching this anime. This anime has a consistent plot, interesting characters and a very unique concept all being explained by the MC. You might feel as though the anime is kind of slow in the beginning but like with all great anime's it picks up the pace 3-4 episodes in. Would have gave it a 5 if it only weren't so short. You should also pick up the light novels once you've finished watching the anime if you want to know what happens after the anime.",5
classroom-of-the-elite,"Honestly can't wait for more seasons of this show. I remember finding it on here one day and thought that maybe it wouldn't be that good so I'll just watch a couple episodes. I was wrong on so many levels. The show grasped my attention and had me begging for more each week. I really do hope another season comes out soon. If one does, I look forward to see what happens next and to learning more about the different charachters.",5
classroom-of-the-elite,"This show was amazing. It was not your normal high school anime that we are all so used to. Instead, the two main characters make the show a surprise to watch. Not only do they have their own secrets of the past, but they also make the show hard to predict. Almost every episode this season was finding out some secret that the other members of each class have hidden away.It was an exciting anime to watch and I hope that they make another season.",5
classroom-of-the-elite,"This show has many characters that we get to see many sides of. Even though this anime is based off a light novel and some people probably think that the protagonist is just a ""Light Novel Protagonist"", that's not true at all. We get to see many sides of the main character, Kiyotaka Ayanokoji. This anime contains a variety of characters, a reclusive quiet girl, a guy who loves basketball, a girl that can get along with anyone, a smart 'leader of the class' kind of guy, a shy girl who loves her privacy and many more. To sum it up, everyone should watch Classroom of the Elites, it's that great of a show.",5
classroom-of-the-elite,"I love the main character because he is different from the usual teenager in high school animes. I'm so interested in his background and origin from the snippets we get in the anime. I tried to find the manga, but the characters are really different from the show. I like the anime better because he is so cool, nonchalant, clever, tough, and interesting. All the other characters are so unique which adds so much more to the show. I honestly desperately wish there was a season 2!",4
classroom-of-the-elite,The Premis of the show is very Interesting and I imagine another season is on the way BUT let me state why this didnt get a 4 or 5 star rating from me im typically very critical about Drama anime and shows because I feel as though its easy to make drama but not easy to envision how personalities ( characters ) go about overcoming the drama and other obsicles this show did a great job at having the ALREADY GENIUS characters overcome setbacks BUT the didnt develope from it the closest thing to character development in this show was from a side character changeing his ways and becoming a better student later down the road from the support of the lead cast but the majority lead cast never changes on top of that we have all these characters that are presented as very important yet are never touched on im just hoping the series can flesh out these characters in the next season,5

Club chose to move on to the next series on list rather than watch the second episode.,4.5
classroom-of-the-elite,"I seen this was on Spotlight or the email, and thought why not based on the premise. A group of geniuses fighting to reach the top by doing what whatever trick, manipulating nature by undermining the rules with exploiting loop holes. Almost everyone is doing it in this show. That one of the reasons I loved watching this show. The other reasons is the  fast pace drama that goes on in the show, the fitting music choice to amp each scene, the  colorful cast of  Class D highlights this very well, and the setting its self made for a engaging watch. It had so many  great twists, and turns along with hints throwed at you to keep you coming back!",4.5
classroom-of-the-elite,"I have to say this was compelling, this show has really makes you think something will happen and then it does a 180. Its very cleaver and i feel like a lot of anime fans who really enjoy things like death note will love this. The context of the show is there is a school filled with the elite children who are ranged in 4 classes from A-D. They are given money at the start of their time there and many spent poorly, as children would. They soon find out that that money is all they will get for free and that they will have to compete with the other classes to get more money. Its actually very on the nose how they show class divisions in a classroom environment. We seem to go down a path with the MC were we think about Class and the order of class and whether it is or could ever be fair. Some might say its pretty Communist level thinking, id say it starts of more socialist. But, by the end we see the game for what it really is you should differently watch!",5
classroom-of-the-elite,"TLDR: This is one of the best anime's from 2017, so go and watch it. You won't regret it. After averaging up the categories I'm giving it a 9.4/10 or 4.7/5 StarsStory: The first Episode gives you a complete false sense of security and then rips it away right at the end.Without spoilers lets just say the school is not as it seems. The characters tackle interesting situations in a plethora of unique ways. I don't want to even go into detail since going into this show blind was such a treat. My only gripe is that some of the problems that the main character deals with feel like they're far below his god tier intelligence. His interesting past is being foreshadowed and I can't wait to see it in S2. 8/10Art: The animation in this Anime is really clean and detailed. The lighting is very refined and crisp. The use of high-lights and mid-tones is superb. The faces characters make are believable.The detail in the backgrounds is great too. It really pisses me off this anime didn't get nominated for best animation of the year. 10/10Sound: The voice acting is great, the music fits the situations and sounds good. The sound effects are slightly above average. 9/10Characters: The characters in this show are interesting. The main character is so great when something happens I can't help but wonder what he'll do next. My only gripe with him is that he's so much smarter than everyone else but lowers his grades and always holds back in general, as well as when he solves a problem he never want's the credit, so he lies and gives it to someone else. The side characters are also really good too, no bullshit tropes every one is their own person. Would go into more detail but don't want to spoil. 10/10Enjoyment: I binged the whole show in a day...What more must be said...? 10/10Verdict: 9.4/10 or 4.7/5 Stars",4
classroom-of-the-elite,"To the average viewer the show appears to be cliche. There's the average genius protagonist to your right and the tsundere with insecurities to your left,,, but unlike many other shows-- there's a reason for everything. There's a reason why the main protagonist is monotone, there's a reason why the tsundere has insecurities, there's a reason why it occurs at a school secluded by the rest of the world, there's a reason why there was half an episode about missing panties. It wasn't just for comedic relief or a filler-- there was a reason. idk abt you guys but it's one of the most logical shows i've come across.  I can 100% guarantee you, whoever you may be reading this, that as long as you're logical and watch this anime with an open mindset you will not regret watching this",5
classroom-of-the-elite,"I really loved this anime, it does have a lot of build up, but its worth watching, you can find out who the main character really is in episode 2 if you pay attention. But it doesn't take full root until the end of twelve. I hope they do another few seasons soon it has great potential. Its more of a thriller mystery. You don't know the characters very well, and its about finding them out. But it is a very fudged up world, very like the real one. Life is like a carton of eggs, the trick is to not have them all broken before you can go get new ones. And some of us are born with a carton that's already got broken eggs in it. And that's all we can ever buy. Anyways its a must watch.",5
classroom-of-the-elite,"Imagine a world you can do whatever you want and live in a lap of luxury. This is what the illusion is about, all the students get to live in an area where you got what you wanted and there was no stipulations, unless you forgot to read the fine print.The students were only focused on the main prize till a wrench got put in some of their plans. It goes through a little bit of each person's life at random times, some were worth it. I definitely want to see more of the main character in action or things that would trigger a full blown attack since he seems to day dream about the past.Other characters seemsd to want to help but had to hide themselves from harm and danger by the other 3 classesAll the characters in the school have a wide range of personalities. Of course, it would not be complete without the clicks within the classrooms, who's being singled out, etc. While this show did steer out of path at times, it stay pretty consistent throughout.",5
classroom-of-the-elite,"Mostly Spoiler Free, Spoilers MarkedAn interesting anime all in all, this is how I will break down my review:Art: This show had no intense battle scenes, or overly complicated characters and mechas, so right from the get go, it would be pretty hard to screw this category up. The characters look more or less like you would expect high-schoolers to look like, so no crazy hair, or insane eyes or what not. For the most part, at least. As most of the characters look so ordinary, the ones that don't stick out like a sore thumb. Unlike most high school shows where this leads to a short game of spot the main character, here the odd-ones-out are antagonists and side characters. A giant, bald, buff, black high schooler in japan? Possible, but not in line with the rest of the characters.4/5Voice acting: Again, nothing special or out of the ordinary here. No attack names to shout out, or overly dramatic scream and cry moments. The voices are suited to the characters, and the MC does sound apathetic enough, which suits him. One quip I have is the customary engrish. You'd think that with the amount of native english speaking weebs out there by this point, there would be a handful of fluent VAs specializing in english speaking characters, but maybe the industry hasn't caught up yet. This aggravates me enough to knock down an entire point.4/5Premise: A nifty take on high school, the premise itself is interesting, IMHO. There are a few unexplained plot holes that irk me, but nothing major enough to destroy the suspension of disbelief. For me a problem with a lot of the ""closed off school"" premises, is that they quickly veer into illegal and dangerous territory, yet still take place in the middle of Tokyo. here at least nothing extreme happens. Even the worst students have their basic needs taken care of for free. The only thing that bothers me is that they all have cellphones, yet contact with the outer world is forbidden. How is this enforced? I thought it might be an inner network, where they can only contact each other, but Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideone of the characters apparently posts selfies to instagram? If anyone actually does have an explanation (either plausible headcanon or Visual novel info), then please tell me.4/5Plot: Although the plot is interesting, it moves very veeeeeeeeryyyyy slowly. The plot is driven by character motivations rather than exterior occurrences, so that does make sense. In addition, even though the overarching plot moves very slowly, the episodes go by rather quickly, and I don't remember being bored with any episode thinking it was obsolete or three times to long. This includes the filler pool episode, which was even enjoyable. The character motivations aren't too odd or unbelievable, especially when you take into account that from the get go most of the characters are inherently flawed to a point at which they had to go to this specific school in the first place.4/5Unique elements: Every episode is titled after a philosophical quote, that supposedly has something to do with the contents of the episode. Most of the time this is a stretch. A lot of people found this to be pretentious and therefor annoying, but I disagree. While it is pretentious, I would hardly say it was annoying. In fact, I want to argue that this is in fact beneficial to the viewers. Even if the quote has little to do with the actual episode, they are all interesting quotes, and some of them even caused me to research the person who said them and read further. That's more than you can say for most episode titles (that can sometimes even spoil entire episodes *ahem* One Piece *ahem*).4/5",5
parasyte-the-maxim-,"Parasyte was one of the first horror manga I read.  I didn't think I'd like it at first since horror wasn't really my 'thing,' but it grew on me and became one of my top-rated series.  So I was ready to be disappointed by a mediocre anime adaptation.  But guess what - so far it's been fantastic!  While the character designs have been changed a bit, and the technology updated (the manga's 25 years old now, so there have to be some changes to make it modern), the story, horrors, thrills, comedy, and pacing are spot on.  Migi is their same rational, calculating (yet slightly endearing) self.  The animation looks great, and if this keeps up, I can expect interesting existential discussions and awesome action later on.Word of caution: If you don't like gore, and humans morphing into toothy monsters, stay away!  This is grisly!",5
parasyte-the-maxim-,"This series is nearly flawless. By far one of the best of the late 2014 simulcats, and masterfully blends intense action and suspense with a deep character base. The MC feels very relatable in his circumstances, and the series will consistently keep you pleading for more. Great music, better animation and art style, and devoid of many of the typical character tropes that plague many of today's anime series. Click play. You won't regret it.",5
parasyte-the-maxim-,"Back in 1997 the manga for this anime was released to North American readers in a magazine, similar to shonen jump, called Mixxzine by a company that would be later called Tokyo Pop. Other manga titles in that were far more popular/well known published in the same magazine were Sailor Moon and Magic Knights Rayearth. For 16 years I've been waiting to see parasyte released as an anime series and the wait has been totally worth it. There is some changes in order to modernize this series that was released back in 1988 but they don't seem to affect the telling of the story. This is a must watch!",5
parasyte-the-maxim-,"Finally after almost giving up hope on 2014, this one managed to shine.Plot , character and concept are engaging and compelling , each episode gives a edge of the seat experience.This isn't for the light hearted , it certainly has a more mature theme which probably explains it's lack of popularity as it isn't like the younger more colorful anime based for the childish audience. There is some light humor and wit mainly expressed by the spock like personality of Migi who speaks only with logic and do away with all human emotions, tied to the main character who is practically the opposition.Without giving any plot away as you can simply read it on wiki, this is certainly one of those titles you may not have heard of a hidden gem and a must watch.",5
parasyte-the-maxim-,"A heartwarming tale of ruthless murder, senseless violence, and the timeless love shared between a man and his right hand. There's an odd charm about watching a bumbling teenage protagonist suddenly sprout eyeballs on random locations over his body, or seeing a man's head suddenly morph into a dozen razor-sharp knives. Jokes aside, this show offers some poignant insights into the human condition and what it means to be alive. It's certainly entertaining all around, and a real roller-coaster of emotion.Oh, Parasyte, I can't quit you!",5
parasyte-the-maxim-,"Actually, I was hooked after the opening 10 seconds of the show. GULP. This show is badass and is currently my favorite of the season. And thank god it's not censored to hell and back like Terraformars. So thanks for not treating us like children with this anime, Crunchyroll!This show is great with the laughs, too. The bathroom scene killed me. Literally killed me. Then I was reborn like a phoenix from ashes to sing the praises of Parasyte!",5
parasyte-the-maxim-,"I came to this anime without any expectations- all I knew is that I wanted to see something action packed and filled with gore. Ever since season 1 of Tokyo Ghoul was over, I was hungry for more bloody body ripping action, so here I am. At first, it seemed like a very weird opening but a couple of episodes in I'm already begging for more. The true fun doesn't reach until the middle of the season, so don't give up until then. -Excellent animation-Good music-One of the best character development ever-Exciting like no other.5 Stars!",5
parasyte-the-maxim-,"An anime as well planned out and brilliantly written such as this one is a rare thing to come across. I'm happy to say that the mere existence of this anime restores much of the dying hope I have for the industry. I won't say much in this review, but I will give a specific example in the show that proves the story for this anime was written by someone who actually knows how to write a good story. *Spoiler for episode 4 & 5 ahead*Before episode 5, I questioned the director's choice to put such a blatantly obvious spoiler into the anime's opening. Specifically, the 2 seconds where Shinichi's mum is shown having red lines run across her face (symbolic of how most parasites morph their heads). Then in episode 4, a lot of focus was put onto Shinichi's new found tension with his mother. Back story and character development was given, and the bond Shinichi has with his parents (mostly his mother) was portrayed to be quite strong.Now I knew it was to set up the emotional distress that is to come once Shinchi's mother becomes a parasite (as suggested by the opening). I thought that being given this heads up would dampen the emotional impact of this incident should it occur. I was wrong. The director put that spoiler into the opening because he/she doesn't care if people figure it out. Because he/she knows that the scene was written out so well that even people who know what will happen will still be shocked by  how it happens. Shinichi's emotional reaction, the emphasis on the mother's scar, the fact that the father survives (this is confirmed by the next episode's preview). All very heavy hitting, even for those who knew something along this line would happen.That's how good this show is. Even if you get spoiled for a huge plot twist, it will still shock you when you see it for yourself.10/10",5

parasyte-the-maxim-,"This first episode is the kind that will get you hooked right away. I would say give it a try. As you can see from other reviews there has to be some truth to this. The only downside people seem to have with it is the small differences from the manga. I on the other-hand think Madhouse did a great job there. The manga character designs were a bit bland and didn't stand out in the manga and some scenes were completely changed, I think for the better. For example, there is a scene where someone gropes a young woman but in the manga it is much more vulgar, very classy Madhouse It's the kind of action horror show that will keep you wondering what will happen next and keep you glued to the screen the whole time.",5
parasyte-the-maxim-,"This is about as honest a review as you're going to see. If you haven't seen this show yet, open the first episode right now and prepare for a roller-coaster. I wish I had watched this sooner as it has zero fan service, zero filler, minor amounts of monologue, intelligent and creative writing, compelling characters with good development balanced out with very well animated intense action sequences. Honestly what else do you want? Its 24 episodes that are going to leave you wishing there was more at the end but happy you made the journey. Binge this in 2-3 days (or one if you have that kind of time, you filthy animal) because you sure as hell aren't going to watch it slowly (cliff-hanger warning). The only warning I have is for those that are not fans of animated blood, as this show has its fair share. Its not overtly gross at any point, but could cause some discomfort if that's really not your thing. That being said, I think this is a great anime for people who have never watched anime, or have been life long fans of the art form.I'll definitely be coming back a year or two from now when I've forgotten most of the minute plot details it to re-experience this thrilling story.",5
parasyte-the-maxim-,"It's very hard to give this series justice with a short review and without spoiling anything crucial, but I'll simply state that it is one of the best I've ever seen, very intriguing, greatly paced and emotionally engaging without cheap tricks and overly done cliches.It mixes sci-fi, horror and some emotional drama pretty much perfectly, making what could otherwise be a simple excuse for some action and gore into a moving story, that keeps you at the edge of you seat much of the time and makes you care deeply about the characters. It also never overstays it's welcome, leading the intrigue in a very consistent pace and ending on a very strong note. Even the brutality always seems to serve a purpose, enhancing the grim tone and suspense of the story, rather then being there as an end in itself. While I could get into more details, there's not point in doing so IMO. You should simply watch this series yourself, it's hard for me to imagine a type of viewer who would be disappointed with it.",5
parasyte-the-maxim-,".I am going to keep this review short and tight.Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hide Just like your sister ^_^LOL, don't read spoilers. The villains are very interesting ""people"" and the main characters all behave rationally, never forcing you to suspend your disbelief in order to follow the plotline (which is a problem that is endemic in anime, I've noticed). This endeared me to the show very quickly. Furthermore, the love interest of the series actually has a long history with our protagonist, and isn't some random ditzy girl with magic powers... another departure from the typical anime cliche's that helped to win me over.The fight scenes are really good, with one or two exceptions, the drama is well delivered and not too predictable, and there are no cheesy tropes to distract you from the genuinely interesting story. All in all, I would say that this is the best show I've seen on Crunchyroll, yet. Fair Warning, to those who care: There is a fair bit of gore to it, even though I never felt that it was excessive, and the show isn't shy around adult-oriented sexual themes; TLDR: it's not for kids.",5
parasyte-the-maxim-,"Imagine an anime adaptation of ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" with a bit John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" for good measure, and you get Parasyte, one of the most heart pounding and suspenseful series I have ever seen! Studio MADHOUSE brings Hitoshi Iwaaki's classic seinen manga from the late 80s and adapts it to a modern setting to tell a grisly horror tale about parasitic and cannabalistic aliens who burrow into and take control of a living being's brain, where they learn to adapt and survive in their new environment while preying upon innocent people. One of these Parasytes accidentally takes over the right hand of high school student Shinichi (voiced by newcomer Nobunaga Shimazaki), forcing him and his new ""friend"" Migi (voiced by Haruhi Suzumiya's Aya Hirano) to work together to fight against these cannibalistic creatures, all while desperately trying to keep Shinichi's new power a secret. With superb voice acting from talent including Kana Hanazawa, Miyuki Sawashiro, and Atsuko Tanaka, highly engaging and fleshed out characters, grisly animated fight scenes courtesy of MADHOUSE, suspenseful twists and turns that leave you at the edge of your seat in every episode, and a deep and meaningful story about life and the struggle for living things to survive on Earth, Parasyte is one hell of a ride from start to finsish and should definitely not be missed! WATCH IT!",5
parasyte-the-maxim-,"Parasyte is a good sci-fi action drama with some borderline horror and gore elements.  The story concerns a boy, Shinichi, who's body is nearly taken over by a sentient parasyte.  In order to survive Shinichi forms an alliance with the creature to protect both their lives from the other invaders.  .From a story perspective Parasyte is fascinating.  The titular parasyte is named Migi, and is as alien in persona as it is physically.  The story covers the two characters' adventures and struggles and their growth.  BOTH Shinichi and Migi have character arcs over the course of the show, though owing to their limited knowledge it's unclear how much of their growth is from the side effects of their relationship, but clearly most of it is character growth.  .The story focus is very narrow so the plot takes on a bit of a monster of the week slash mystery adventure formula.  There are other parasytes that are antagonists, and other characters that are allies and still more that are somewhere in the middle.  There are mentions of bigger picture events going on elsewhere in the world but Parasyte keeps the focus on the two main characters.  .Production wise Parasyte is a treat.  Fluid animation, interesting and dynamic character designs, exciting fight choreography, and immersive music and Foley led me to marathon the show in two nights.  My only complaint is Shinichi's VA tended to deliver his lines in the same tone and cadence a lot, which got annoying and distracting.  It's true that at that point in the story Shinichi is subdued and feeling down a lot, but I don't think that's enough to account for the VA's droning performance.  .This leads me to my only real complaints about the show, which primarily is that Shinichi tends to over think problems and situations a lot, and it gets worse closer to the end of the show.  He spends a lot of time examining philosophical problems that are superficially deep but could easily have been answered with a google search.   He will come to a conclusion in one scene, and in the very next scene take the contradictory action.  It felt unnecessary, and a lot of the time the subject matter was trying to resolve moral equivalencies with the parasytes and the other animals and plants on Earth in relation to humanity, moral equivalencies that have no basis in logic or reason.  My other complaint is the show is a bit on the predictable side.  There were some scenes and characters that were just so obviously there to check a box and wring some emotion out of the viewer.  .All in all Parasyte is a great engrossing watch.  I wanted to ding it a star for my complaints but it's really good otherwise and it has a good ending so I changed my mind.  Give it a shot!",5
parasyte-the-maxim-,"Packed with super gory action, from start to finish.  Even though it is mostly action, there are some touching moments that pull on the heartstrings. It was a very realistic and reasonable reaction to what would happen if aliens came to earth. Also handles topics such as ""what makes a human, human? "", ""What is love, and how does it affect the way that we and act?"", "" humans are destroying the earth by themselves, would it really be better off if these aliens wiped the entire population out?"" "" humans exhibit altruistic behavior, even though it is entirely irrational. Why is that?"" Overall, spectacular show, and definitely one of my top ten.",5
parasyte-the-maxim-,"I'm so glad I stumbled and gave this anime a chance. It's honestly one of the best I personally ever seen. The plot is very detailed and deep, often making the viewer question humanity's decisions and their impact towards the environment. Meanwhile, it's spearheaded by a very relatable and likeable protagonist. Every experience he goes through and his reactions of them is grounded and believable, which achieves sympathy from the viewer towards him. Although not as gory or bloody as the manga, the actions scenes are well done and deliver constant high-stakes moments. I did not find a dull moment in this anime, from the dialogue, fights and highly emotional moments, it keeps one's attention from start to finish.",5
parasyte-the-maxim-,"I normally don’t go for serious genres or “horror” and decided to try this out, I was very pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this. It was a bit of a slow start with some characters I didn’t like at first, but it got real good and remained that way up until the very end. This was the most fun I’ve had watching anime in quite some time!Very fun alien spooky anime drama. Had good drama and mystery and actual good characters that I enjoyed seeing progress and mess up.Shinchi and Migi are best bros, this made me think of the 2018 Venom movie, this was almost like a buddy-cop at times which only added to the fun for me.Almost(definitely) cried over a right hand, would watch again.",5
parasyte-the-maxim-,"See kids, THIS is how you take a series of silent, static images and translate them into a TV show. It's not perfect, but it faithfully nails the mood and story of the original while translating it into a new medium, which is remarkably rare to see.I'm not going to gush over it, or explain in detail how every scene manages to avoid a lot of cross-media-translational traps and cliches, but I will recommend it highly.Oh, and yes, for those of you who have heard, the Dubsteppy Wub-Wub soundtrack actually fits very well: It's energetic and dire, just as the show frequently calls for. Stop trying so hard to convince everyone you're a music critic just because you listened to a classical radio station once and you might have some fun sometime!",5
parasyte-the-maxim-,"Nothing has made me quite as stunned as Parasyte. The series left me at a complete loss of words to describe its quality, and though I feel many more series will do this over the years, Parasyte will always be the first one that did.Whether due to my over-fascination with the blood, gore, and body horror this show introduced, or because of the amazing story telling that made me want to finish it, I felt the overwhelming urge to do so. To stay up until unholy hours of the night to finish the series, to continue after cliffhangers, to allow myself to intake all of this show's glory at once.While I must admit nothing is truly perfect, in my honest opinion, Parasyte comes extremely close to being so. Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideThe love subplots with Kana chasing after Shinichi and what appears to be a fragile relationship between Satomi and Shinichi never really felt forced. The blood and body horror fell in my comfort zone, and didn't disturb me in the least. Migi quickly grabbed my attention the moment he appeared, Spoiler Alert!

Many a character dies during Parasyte, though most of their deaths added nicely to the story and didn't seem placed simply for shock value.

parasyte-the-maxim-,"Let me start by saying that I'm not a fan of any one genera of anime in particular, watching anything from shonen, josei, mech, romance, action, comedy, you name it.This anime is extremely well written, animated and developed. The animation is top notch, with great attention to detail and movement. The character development of the main characters and side characters leave you wanting more, and loving and understanding them on a personal level. The core values brought to play through this series are astoundingly well portrayed. The plot is sound, with many twists to keep you wanting more.I binge watched this anime, start to finish in one afternoon and night lol and now I wish I had made it last! Must watch, instant top 10 list right here.",5
parasyte-the-maxim-,"I think the series is extremly good, because in contrast to murderers/monsters/basicially anything which kills your own kind (from your own race, nation or whatever) often portrayed as mindless barbarians, this anime portrayes these monsters/parasytes as highly intelligent and rational.The anime also discusses different viepoints and asks phylosophic questions (for example what makes humans humans and what makes themselves different from animals and even parasites).11/10 why does this not have 500 episodes?",5
parasyte-the-maxim-,"This anime was just recommended to me in passing by a friend, but I decided to watch it mostly out of a lack of other things to do. Boy was I surprised when I stumbled across such an amazing one! Lovable and funny characters, interesting philosophy, and some really, REALLY cool action scenes. The main characters go through very interesting and ever-changing development, all of the characters' drives are understandable and...well, relatable might be a bit of a stretch considering the nature of many of the characters, but regardless a very well-done anime!",5
parasyte-the-maxim-,"The art, the story, the music, in it's totality is BEAUTIFUL!!! All mixed together with the daunting question of, what would happen if something did to humans what we did to animals.

Hooked from the start to the end.",5
parasyte-the-maxim-,"The way everything develops, the story's so fast and yet, it goes exactly in the timeline that the characters are experiencing. Everything relates on the smallest level. Even the way the character's interact is unique! Some talk metaphorically, others simply, and sometimes its a jumbled mess you don't understand! Watching Parasyte is like watching a live action. It makes you want to stay in bed and hide and go out and kick some butt! The ignorance of some characters; how every single one had relatable flaws. Every single line makes you want to scream in agony, cry in defeat, it makes you want to re-evaluate being a human as a whole! Watching Parasyte, listening, the amount of emotion throughout everything is stunning! The development of everyone, the music. Everything! Watching Parasyte is like watching an old friend grow old, through their good and bad. Even when it's over, even when they're dead. You rethink everything.",5
parasyte-the-maxim-,"Parasyte... Where do I begin. It's so unbelievably wonderful and so inimitable in the perfection of it's composition....Parasyte has it all:Romance: 10/10; the romance in this show is certainly prominent and relevant to the story, and develops nicely over the course of the series, yet it doesn't control the show nor the characters, and serves it's role perfectly.Action: 10/10; this show has INSANE action sequences that keep you on your seat, because every single one is both life-threatening and crucial. The fights are always lighting quick and precise, and the animators did a superb job getting it all together. This show is a good 1/5 action, and it is in perfect doses.Horror: 10/10; if I hadn't already given out several 10's earlier, this section would be the only ten. Parasyte excels at creating dread and horror. Particularly in the earlier parts, when much is still unknown, it really hits you hard. AN ACTUAL PLOT: 10/10; this show is a slow burner in the best sense. The episodes are fast paced and convey a lot of information without being expository, but it also takes it's time weaving together the threads of the world. If you want to be glued to your screen every step of the way, this is the show for you. Animation and Sound: 10/10; the animation is always crisp, and I never came across a single frame out of place or lazily done. Through and through, the animation is top-notch. The fights are made all the better by such excellent animation. Sound and music are the highlights of this show because the sound is so well mixed and applied that it amplifies all the emotions you're seeing without ever forcing the feelings upon you. It's the kind of music that makes you feel emotional when you listen to it after the show. The voice actors are all top quality as well, and convey all the perfect amounts (or lack, thereof) of emotion needed to set the tones of the scenes.I cannot recommend this show enough. PLEASE WATCH IT.",5
parasyte-the-maxim-,"The plot of this anime revolves around Shinichi Izumi, a 17 years old boy who right hand was taken over by a parasyte which is later called ""Migi"". the parasyte tried to take control of the Shinichi's brain while he was sleeping and eventually matured in this right hand and the story continues with them coexisting and fighting other man-eating parasytes that took over a human host's brain. My thoughts and opinions: Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideWhen I first started watching this anime, I thought is was disgusting because not to the point where I wasn't interested in the anime anymore because it great cliffhangers that always made me want to see what happens next. When Shinichi Izumi began to change and evolve that when I started to really like this anime. When his mum died and the wanted to protect his father while trying to self discover and make sense of parasyte and human, I was caught. After watching it for a  while, I started to realised there are a lot of biological and psychological theories mixed into this anime, Like when Reiko Tamura protects the baby even she says she has no emotions towards the child and only gave birth to run test on her human child. Even her kinds is more logical and centered in their own lives  nevertheless she die trying to save her child. And a long time ago while I was studying biology I heard the developing theory that human may not be considered at mammals but as parasytes because we are the only organisms on Earth that destroys our surroundings as we moved other than parasites. Because as we discover new land, we tend to destroy it for civilization and we humans are the most evolved and intelligent species that will forever remain on the top of the food chain. I really broke my heart watching the part when Yamagishi and his squad tried to kill the parasyte but killed innocent humans just to achieve the goal. We called parasytes, monsters because they were killing humans for food source because Yamagishi and his squad killed innocent individuals to destroy parasytes for self-protection. How can we call them monster for killing our kind when we are also killing them and our own kind. This anime has somewhat made me to started questions humanity and whether we are parasites in disguise and what is means to be human. Or maybe humans and parasytes are one family and one species.",5
parasyte-the-maxim-,"By far my favourite anime. It's just dark enough, the music is phenomenal, perfectly complementing the rest of the sound design. I can't say I understand spoken Japanese (no matter how much I wish I did), but the cast is good enough that I don't really need to. And that can be hard. The animation in this anime is incredible, designs are just as creepy and dark yet thought provoking simulataneously. I guess that's what you get when you convert a manga. Parasyte is actually an older manga, and -the maxim- modernises just the right places. The first time I watched this anime was when it was being simulcast. Man, the week-long wait was painful. The cliffhangars are in the perfect spot, and the main theme captures the feelings you have so well. There's only repeating in the intro when it's required, which is really nice because I hate hearing the same thing as it ended on every single episode (which many shows do!). I can't really describe it, but when I watched it the first time, I was almost in a depressed state, terrified of the final destination of the anime. Would it end okay? Going through it a second time, and seeing everything I missed the first time, whilst I had been focused on the main content, honestly, it makes me sincerely happy. If you haven't seen this anime yet, I highly, highly recommend it. This second time probably won't be the last time I come back to it.",5
parasyte-the-maxim-,"I'm not a big anime watcher at all. I don't like a lot of the popular anime's. however this anime is different, there is an underline message that is objective so anyone can relate to it. The anime art style is very good i like the way it looks. There are no overly complex characters so its easy to follow them as they grow and develop. There is always an element of mystery with the parasytes even after watching the entire series there is still much to learn about them. Something as simple as there origin is unknown. With a story line that focuses on character development, understand and compromise it teaches you about the balance between human interest and the consequences of them.  Humans fear what they dont understand and parasytes feel humans are weak. however the parasytes learn that's not the case so they learn to compromise. Wish i could say more but the longer i write the harder it gets to not spoil so check it out for yourself.",5
parasyte-the-maxim-,"I came into this series quite skeptical, but within the first few episodes I was attached. Given the name, it's obvious this show is about a parasite of mysterious origin, the hosts being human. It's inevitable given that outline that the boundaries and relationships between these two sentient beings will be explored, as they are with Shinichi, the protagonist, and his parasite, Migi. Parasyte is littered with brutality, psychological trauma, loss, and the aftermath of grief. It's a good insight into the adaptability and will of humans. You'd think the lines between butchers of the human race and their prey would be black and white, but this series will prove you otherwise.",5
parasyte-the-maxim-,"SPOILERS!at the beginning of this show i was really excited to see how they would show the progression of humanity in migi as he developed as a character, but in fact, the total opposite happened.  as the show progressed it was thrilling to see the main character fall further and further away from humanity.  the only thing i want out of this anime is more.  but unfortunately that's not gonna happen",5
parasyte-the-maxim-,This is a really Awesome animes i loved it because of how intense it makes it. This animes gives me a mix of bursting feelings and they are both negative and good for exaple when someone dies in the animes and when someone lives or helps someone else i enjoyed watching it. I would love to see a season 2!! This animes is really good i suggest watching it its easy to finish it wont take that long but even if it does who cares its worth it Good luck if you do watch it.,5
parasyte-the-maxim-,"The premise is clever, the show rotates around a solid theme, and the animation is good. But, I really feel like the pacing of the show jerked and lurched through its 24 episodes. Sometimes a character would evolve suddenly, unexplainably adapting to their new reality with little discussion.  Sometimes they would resist basic knowledge in ways that seemed implausible. Small details get explained in great detail, while sweeping and important events occur between lines of exposition. It's fun, the fight scenes are cool, and the show's point about humanity's arrogant and self-important view of itself at the top of nature is important, but I think a few more episodes and some better scriptwriting would've made this work really sing.",5

parasyte-the-maxim-,"I'm truly sad that this is only one season long. I truly am. But I cannot complain. This anime opened my eyes to horror and sci-fi anime. I watched every episode of this as soon as they were released. Could not get enough of it! Just enough gore, romance, and suspense. It's really a masterpiece. And the word of the live-action movie based on it has made me even more excited. A really wonderful concept, executed beautifully. Good-job to whoever made this anime possible.",5
parasyte-the-maxim-,"Easily one of my favorites since Attack on Titian.  The only way I could see it improving is if it were more horror rather than action.  Parasites make an excellent monster when you normally get rehashes of Zombies, Vampires, or Werewolves parasites are original intimidating and you can make them anything.  Unfortunately through out the series I was never scared which means to me it fails at horror.  But succeeds in every other area.",5

parasyte-the-maxim-,"This anime called Parasyte the maxim, is in my opinion an amazing production because of the action the drama the horror and even a love story are in a next level. Migi is a parasite that didn't succeed at going to the head of his victim. Migi and Izimi have to face many other parasites not so friendly that devour people to survive.This Anime is a must watch to people that loves from everything a little.This anime got me and i enjoyed watching it One Love _ Jose Moreno",4
parasyte-the-maxim-,"I might like this more than Death Note... which says a lot because Death Note was my favorite anime. So far it's going great (hasn't ended yet | new episodes still airing) and every new episode has been unique and unpredictable. This is a very logical and thought proving anime that delves a little into philosophy.The whole parasyte concept is really interesting because they're so mysterious, you aren't given much information on how the parasites came to be (so far). The parasites need to kill in order to remain alive so you can't really blame them and dismiss them as evil because their killing isn't frivolous but sometimes it is, like any human there are good and bad people or in this case parasites. Just watch the first episode and you'll be hooked.",5
parasyte-the-maxim-,"I've only been watching anime for 2 years.But if I had to say which one was my favorite....well, I think you can guess (the reason I'm writing this review :D). This show just appealed to me. The setting, the humor, the characters, the bad>ss parasytes, the gore, the feels...seriously not even AToT was this good (brace the fandom). Really though, watch this. If visceral, brutal action, shape-shifting aliens, and romance  aren't your cup of tea, then...I dunno, watch it anyway. Parasyte: the maxim is that awesome.",5
parasyte-the-maxim-,"I thought the character development was a bit slow in the beginning but ohhhh mannnn it got so intense!!! The episodes now feel like 2 min long, Its over and it feels like I just started it! I watch A LOT OF ANIME, I have a problem in a good way Im recommending this because it stands out and is obviously among the best. I even wrote a review on it. I don't usually write review... another thing, it has a great opening and ending song and amazing soundtrack.",5
parasyte-the-maxim-,"This anime is seriously stunning! Amazing visuals, gorgeous animations, exquisite gore and a super captivativing storyline! This is definitely a MUST watch! If you have a light stomach or have slight problems with gore then this anime is a little bit off the chart. But don't let that stop you! Aside from gore this anime has a beautifully writen storyline and has alot of epic moments that will leave you shocked!",5
parasyte-the-maxim-,"Those five stars don't come easy.  We see the protagonist develop from a bookworm wimp into a beast of a fighting machine, all the while the challenges he faces continue proving ever more difficult to win against.  There are game-changing revelations that completely change the power dynamics and battle tactics, for better or worse.  Expect weekly cliff hangers in this show, leaving eager anticipation for next weeks' episode.  There is never a dull episode in this series.",5

Well balanced and not desperate for your attention. This show will keep your interests with each passing episode.",5
parasyte-the-maxim-,"When i saw the start of this anime i was admittedly a bit skeptical. As the first two episodes progressed However it became a bit more interesting.  Episode one to me was filled with a much softer lighter touch with it's comedic bits. As the first episode finished I admit I wasn't overly convinced so I started to watch the second episode. The second episode started to delve more into character development and a bit of plot development than just character introduction like the first seemed to be which i was pleased to see. It was also nice to see that we got to see some plot development forming in this episode. After that buckle up, because the emotional roller coaster is starting up and it looks like it's going to keep going as long as the series does! As the cover art shows you have your action, and of course like in the first episode you have bits of comedy in there that will make you laugh. It also has that lovely air of mystery as things progress leading the viewer wondering just what's going to happen next (ahh properly done cliffhangers). As a girl I loved the romance that develops in it (don't worry everyone you see the makings of it in the first couple episodes). And OMG the sad parts!!! yes.. there are sad parts.. there are plenty of moments that will tug at your heart strings, and some that will make you want to reach into your screen or tv and bash a person in the face. (like i said emotional roller coaster). Overall I must say I am thoroughly hooked and looking forward to sticking along for the ride. This girls not going anywhere.",5
parasyte-the-maxim-,"I hadn't heard of Parasyte before stumbling across it on Crunchyroll, but I'm glad I found it, because it's hands down one of the best shows on the site, and probably one of the top 3 animes of 2014/2015.The animation and art style are well done, and the main characters are fleshed out and developed. The shows are paced very well and most of the episodes have few, if any lulls or dull spots. That's not to say it's overly action heavy, but that even the milder or tame conversation areas seem interesting and draw you into the show more.I'd try to compare it to a similar show to say 'If you liked X you'll like Parasyte', but there really isn't another series like it. There are aspects that are similar to Guyver, Xam'd or other alien animes, but they're just genre similarities and Parasyte stands on it's own. Definitely in the quality range of a Cowboy Bebop, Macross Plus, Code Geass or similar shows.",4
parasyte-the-maxim-,"Unlike most other anime series the last couple of seasons, this one is actually enjoyable to watch. It has it's own style and belongs to a smaller and more interesting genre, not like the other cliché mecha/harem bullshit ripoffs that Japan has been barfing out lately. Parasyte also manages to pull of the gore without making it feel like a desperate attempt to cover a dull story. I was about to give up on anime for a while but Parasyte brought me back in.",5
parasyte-the-maxim-,"When I picked up the show at 2 episodes released I was a little skeptical about it, but it drew me in quickly, and is now the anime i most look forward to releasing each week. The horror/action/thriller theme isn't usually what I go for, but it works out really well. The main character develops quickly out of the whiny phase (thank god), unlike most other similar shows, and the character development in general is frankly amazing all around. The show starts to make you question what being human means, and how we deal with atrocities that happen. For the sake of his survival, the main character has to lose some of what makes him human, while others seem to gain it throughout the series. Frankly this is one of my top 5 by far, and it's not over yet. There's only one downside: This show is amazingly good at cliffhangers. Literally every episode. Prepare yourself!",5
death-march-to-the-parallel-world-rhapsody,"I've been reading the manga, so I have a bit of insight on this. I read a lot of Isekai, and this ranks higher on the list than most. I'll try and avoid any spoilers.MC is a very relatable character and his decisions make sense. He's not a depraved pervert, but he's not naive either. He attracts some younger companions, but as he says in the first episodes, is not a lolicon. He's more of a father figure and prefers taking advantage of brothels and tavern wenches to touching his companions. He's also intelligent and curious about magic.The world isn't such a nice place. Racial discrimination and human trafficking, which can provide a greater sense of realism. Magic is powerful but not so commonplace that everyone can use it. There is plenty of exploration in the story. The MC is not so weak that he has to grind or stick around any one place. This is a good series if you like adventure. Author is good a paying attention to the detailsLooking at the anime specifically, I personally like the pacing so far. Design is a bit different from the manga, but the animation quality is top notch. I'm looking forward to future episodes.",4
death-march-to-the-parallel-world-rhapsody,"I feel like I spent most of this anime waiting for something to happen. I am one of the fools who love Isekai. It is one of my favorite genres. This one just bores me. Feels like each time something exciting is going to happen and the plot is going to start, they go shopping and eat all of the wonderful meats. Yea meat! I love meat as much as the next guy, but I need more than watching children eating meat in my anime. Then they top it off with discussing a play or telling a character's backstory and I am stuck thinking, ""I wish I was watching that anime."" At this point, I am more ""hate-watching"" the anime. The animation is fine, I think the world has interesting potential. Just wish the main character was more interesting or something, anything, for the love of God anything, was happening.",5
death-march-to-the-parallel-world-rhapsody,"the biggest problem in this anime, same as it is in the manga, is that the main character is the least interesting character in the story. I get the concept, but it's an over saturated market in which all this has to offer is a slightly different kind of harm.The big problem is that because the MC can master any skill as it shows up, any dramatic event that happens is going to be moot. He is a demi-god, were little to nobody can actually challenge him, yet the story acts like your normal fantasy.The strong points of this story is going to be the supporting cast, as we will get to see them grow as characters, in which the MC acts like a mentor. the setting as well is a good aspect of the story, mainly relaxed with short spurts of action, all around fun.Overall this is a power fantasy anime, and one where you can find it done better elsewhere.",2
death-march-to-the-parallel-world-rhapsody,"Despite basically bringing nothing new to the table, this anime is likely to do well because it does a loved concept in a way that doesn't scare anyone off. You probably won't find a moving story, characters with depth, or any sort of realism, but strangely that seems to be a strength of the show. There is so little going on that you can kinda turn your brain off and just watch things happen. The constant acquisition of titles, items, and skills is strangely relaxing and enjoyable. The writer pays attention to detail, so you actually get to experience how the skills and items he acquires affect the experience. While I appreciate the casual atmosphere this creates, I'm still not going to call this show anything better than average though. This show would be made better by either focusing on being casual and relaxing or wish-fulfilling, rather than trying to be both. These paper-thin plots get in the way of just watching someone gathering skills and friends. For example, did anyone at all care about the demon lord? It was more entertaining to watch the protagonist level up his NPC companions. For example, does the protagonist's obsession with not being found at as OP conducive to wish fulfillment. These elements get in the way of each other because this anime is unfocused, which prevents me from giving 4 stars. So, final verdict, it doesn't do anything extremely wrong, but you will definitely feel like you've seen this one before. I recommend not taking it too seriously as active thought will probably ruin the fun. 3 stars.",3
death-march-to-the-parallel-world-rhapsody,"I genuinely liked the slow pacing of this anime for the most part. No overarching plot, no desperate mission to save the world, no grand mission. He's just a normal person, not a hero but still with the basic morals of our world. The rather aimless nature of each episode actually drew me into the world even more. I must admit the harem-but-not-a-harem is a bit weird at first but the show really stresses how he feels protective of them and doesn't want to lay a finger on them. All in all, a relaxing anime centred around taking things slow and as they come.",3
death-march-to-the-parallel-world-rhapsody,"I expected an over the top wish-fulfillment anime going into it and that's what I got.It had enjoyable elements and promising plot points but as its gone on its devolved, for me, into a-harem-that's-not-a-harem-but-totally-is far too quickly.I feel they introduced too many characters who seem to be there just to check a box on the harem list instead of being actually meaningful in anyway. There are too many characters to divided development on and its detrimental to every character and the plot at once.Also the animation and art quality fluctuates and has dropped more and more as the series goes on.I had to drop it.",4
death-march-to-the-parallel-world-rhapsody,"In the age of anime we live in where everything has to have some deep philosophy behind it or be some kind of new revolutionary idea for the medium I think people are getting a little too tight ass about shows lately. I avoided this specifically for all the hate it had but I doubt any of them sat past the first 2 episodes. I'm glad I just got bored today and decided to binge this. I'm not saying this show is something amazing I just think it's not as bad and a ""disgrace to the industry"" some of these Anime youtubers say it is. That being said if you get your information and taste of anime from these people who quite frankly have sticks up their ass and don't watch enough stuff in general to be experts on anything than you have some other issues to work out. I simply enjoyed the watch and would honestly not mind a season 2. People compare this character to kirito but there are some fairly drastic differences in personalities. Also while people consider this a harem it's really not considering the main character see's them as an extended family and treats them as such. He literally mentions it multiple times he is their guardian and does not make advances. Not to mention the girls aren't really in love with him ( except one obviously lmao ) they are all young and pretty much look to him like a father figure. In fact, the MC literally goes out to get laid multiple times in the show at brothels lmao and is not even remotely ashamed about it. I think it was a refreshing take on the genre ( although he MMO aspects were weak ) and wouldn't mind more. From what I hear anyway the source material is actually quite good the anime was just fast-paced and shaved off a lot of detail. That's not really their fault it's just how seasonal shows work now.",2
death-march-to-the-parallel-world-rhapsody,"After finishing the season, I have to modify my stance a bit. While I've found most of the series enjoyable, especially the opening episodes, the later down the line it became much more stale and fanservice'y, going only slightly above In Another World With my Smartphone. In general:+ The RPG setting and gamey touches were consistently fun and creative.+ The adventure/exploration stuff was humorous and fun to watch throughout the season.But...- The slave harem was becoming progressively more creepy (and simply too big - no place for character development in such a crowd).- The protagonist's heroics killed his neutral stance from the beginning of the series and pretty much ripped any interesting grow potential out of him.- The ending was very much a sequel-bait and didn't even start developing the main intrigue/challenge.In general, I think the show devolved into being very generic after a fine start, but was still something I very much enjoyed watching. If you're looking for something borderline dumb, but well-produced and relaxing, you can count on this series to deliver - just don't expect action.------------------------------------So, this show gets a lot of extreme reactions, so I will offer my stance on it, mostly referring to things people dislike about it and why I disagree with their assessments. Before that I will just say that I don't think this is a super high-quality show, but I will argue that it's an immensely enjoyable power fantasy that makes great use of its (very literal) RPG setting - it's an adventure within a video game and a very relaxing/fun one at that. So, to the people's complains:1. The protagonist is absurdly OP: Yes, he's basically a cheater within a game. A demi-god of sorts. However, he's not someone who wants to be a hero or a villain - having escaped his previous, miserable life, he looks for adventure, opportunity to explore and enjoy the new world that opened to him. It's a casual, ""boring"" motivation, but one that I personally really enjoy.2. The protagonist have slaves and don't free them, and the show paints him as the good guy: Yes, the protagonist has a ""slave harem"" of sorts and don't even consider freeing any of them at this point. Is it wrong? Probably. Does it go against how the protagonist is portrayed here? Not really. He, in the end, acts for selfish reasons. He has nearly unlimited power and will help people when he has an opportunity (as it costs him nothing), but if having slaves benefits him, he'll keep them. If he thinks they're better off with him then on their own, he won't give another thought about the moral implications of it all. After all, he's not a hero. He's a guy that wants to build a life for himself in a foreign world and will take full advantage of the opportunities that lie before him.3. Action is poor/there's not much action: Yes, but that's not the point of the show. This show is about exploring a new world and adventure. That part, in my opinion, is very enjoyable. But if you're looking for action-packed fantasy series, it's simply not for you.4. It was done so many times, is there even a point to it?: That's a valid point. This series got a lot of heat for being iterative and it's hard to really argue with that - its only advantages over utter trash such as In Another World with my Smartphone are better writing and very extensive, consistent references to game mechanics and the artificial nature of its world (I think it's done better here than any other isekai show I've seen so far). But it's enough for me. In the end, it's a pretty subjective thing. But I definitely believe the harshest criticisms this show gets are misguided. For me, it's an absolute blast, even if I'm very well-aware of its questionable elements and shortcomings.",4
death-march-to-the-parallel-world-rhapsody,"I thouroughly enjoyed the beginning up until the dragon-thing appeared that was attacking the city. When that happened I was like ""oh boy, something interesting is about to happen!"", but nothing did happen. I really wanted to see the protagonist use his O.P. skills to overcome a great evil or struggle... or at least fight some more monsters.... Instead he uses them to make a harem of slave girls .  I liked the opening so much that I gave it a chance, but it was just so boring! I felt like I was always waiting for something to happen, and for the paper-thin plot to thicken. However, rather than that happening, the anime got worse. Instead it attempts to fuse three genres in a terribly unsuccessful way laying waste to the plot. If you like harem anime or slice of life, this  is mediocre at best. If you like action and plot, don't bother watching past episode one or two.",4
death-march-to-the-parallel-world-rhapsody,"If you are looking for an anime with lots of in depth plot, this is NOT it. If you don't like harems same deal, steer clear.Personally, I would almost call this a fantasy slice of life, with a few episodes of action mixed in. Overall the anime is forgettable but enjoyable. watching this weekly, it was not an anime I was waiting to the minute for; instead, this was an anime I would just relax and turn off the ol'thinker to watch. That's not saying you have to or you should, but you can.Without giving spoilers, this is an anime that sees the standard in many anime and just meets it without going over or under. watching it some times gave me a chuckle, some times gave me a ""oh that's neat"" or ""that's cool I guess"" but it was never broke course or the mould (not necessarily a bad thing)Should you watch and Finish it?If you like a relaxed anime, watch it and see how you feel. no need to finish it if you don't want.",1
death-march-to-the-parallel-world-rhapsody,"Boring, poorly-executed cookie-cutter isekai harem show with bland characters and no plot to speak of. The protagonist is 29, but gets shoved into the body of a teenager so that it's somehow okay when he talks about how big a 13 year old girl's breasts are (don't worry, folks, there's an entire scene in the first episode dedicated to how much he's totally not a lolicon). He literally buys some of the harem girls as slaves, and doesn't set them free, because apparently Satou thinks slavery is just fine as long as it's happening to children who will later try to seduce him.The art is bad and low-budget. The character designs are boring, with Satou looking completely identical to every other protagonist in the entire genre. The music is bad, when there's music at all. The plot has absolutely no stakes or tension, because Satou is so unbelievably overpowered that no possible situation can cause him any problems that he won't resolve in seconds with his godly skills. The game mechanics in the setting make absolutely no sense. The OP is a badly-sung song over a cheaply-made animation. It's a harem show where five of out the seven or eight girls are actual, literal children. The setting is visually ugly, conceptually boring, filled with overdone cliches, and revealed almost entirely through dull exposition. None of the characters have any personalities, instead just wandering around smiling blankly and going shopping while insinuating that they all have crushes on the equally boring protagonist.I genuinely can't think of a single positive to put in here, even in the interest of fairness. This is the worst show of the season, please don't waste your time with it.",4
death-march-to-the-parallel-world-rhapsody,"I really wanted to like this show... but it ended up being just another utterly boring harem anime. While I love the isekai genre, this show does nothing to move the genre forward. Instead it follows the same formulaic system: start off OP, doesn't do much with it, collect girls, wander around aimlessly. Yawn. The MC is as dull as a stack of concrete blocks. For someone who starts off extremely OP and with the mind of a 29-year old, would it be so incredulous to believe that he'd just start off slaying some serious mobs and getting stuff done, like freeing slave girls? I don't. And god, it's sooooo boring!! This show is so boring! Slice of life shows have better plots and more excitement than this crap.",4
death-march-to-the-parallel-world-rhapsody,"I loved the show. The pacing was nice. Its and rpg setting. So it's more about exploration then action which I fully enjoyed. the harem didnt bother me because it's not really a harem, not that I havnt watched or harem or have a problem with them. He has all these women  but to him they are family like sisters or daughters which I really like because it kinda changes it up a little bit. The Mc is overpowered but he isn't focused on anything but exploration, he dont care about making a name for himself. Also the Mc is relatable he helps because he wants to, but will take advantage of what he can within his moral reasoning. I really hope they make another season soon. I have watched this show twice over and still love it. Hopefully they next season will be longer. Also to those who dont like the show, that's totally cool if it's not your thing, but please dont ruin and slander something that we all like. The point on anime is to escape from the norm and enjoy something new. So please dont make bad reviews",4
death-march-to-the-parallel-world-rhapsody,"I'm really not a fan of the magic and swords type anime. Even though I did enjoy SAO and some of the offshoots. This gets 5 stars for being unique. I can't tell you how often I find myself yelling at the TV ""NO YOU IDIOT, DON'T DO IT"" and then later, frustrated when the characters are surprised by whatever outcome became of the foolish action.That said, there was none of that in this show!!! The MC was very likable. He's slightly older which is a nice stab at the ""life ends after high school"" mindset of most animes. And with his age he expressed an enduring level of self control and wisdom in his actions. Instead of being hormone driven and constantly bewildered by circumstances, he goes through a logical process of thought while selflessly considering his companions. Extremely refreshing, very enjoyable, thoroughly entertaining and great artwork and plot. I'll probably end up watching it again. (which I rarely do)I'd like to see more MC like this one.",1
death-march-to-the-parallel-world-rhapsody,"like the title says, i feels like one giant prologue to a show that is trying to get off the ground, but didnt get enough episodes to fully tell the story it wants to tell. not to say it doesn't deserve it, because i really believe this show is unique from a lot of other anime i've seen. the protagonist feels like a genuine character (with actual morals) and the characters that follow him around feel less like a harem and more like an evergrowing family (to me anyway)i really don't understand why this show has a harem tag because this really doesn't feel like a harem anime at all, which feels like a dis-service to label this show so, when it's actual so much more than that.in short i hope this show gets a second season because i would really like to see what the story is capable of doing after it's first 10 episodes of setup.",3
death-march-to-the-parallel-world-rhapsody,"Just one star seems a bit low, but two is more than I would like to give it, let say I give it 1.5 stars.Concept seemed at least enjoyable at the start, the first episode having some funny moments, but the slow pacing crept up real fast and drag the show down to its knees.Now we see the protagonist doing sweet nothing, while he meets new lolis/waifus every other episode or so and then recruits them in his own personal loli crew. There is so many different loli/waifu types, it's like he's trying to become the pokémon master of lolis/waifus. He got some furry lolis, a slave loli, an elf loli, a sexual deviant loli and a zombie waifu, not counting the warrior waifu which will inevitably join him at one point or another. They waste so much time on the lolis, they finally just got the cart they have on the promo picture on episode nine.And a ""Death March"" my ass. They have been standing in the same city since the second episode. A better title would be ""Death Layover"".Also the creator of this has absolutely no idea how to design a game. There's way to many different skills, he probably has a skill to master before he can wipe his ass properly.I don't even know why I am still watching at this point. I sincerely hate this show. I just don't know how much worse it can get, but this is the only thing the show deserves every time, at least.",5
death-march-to-the-parallel-world-rhapsody,Please Note This first three episode only cover the prologue and up the introduction of the Seiyruu City arc as well as the introduction of the labyrinth exploration in Seiyruu city in the first Light Novel ( PACING PICKS UP IN EPISODE THREE A LOT COMPARED TO SOURCE MATERIAL) Having read the first three Light Novels I didn't know what to expect with the first episode going into this and I was really surprised.Everything in terms of the animation was excellent to the opening/ending which seem to suit the show really well for those looking for something a bit different in the isekai genre this really is not a normal copy paste isekai. The first two episodes have done an excellent job taking the source material ( the light novels/web novels ) and adapting them into the show though they did cut out the Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hidebath scene for those into fan service. the next couple episodes will be leading into the introduction of the slaves that were briefly shown in the market each of which have an adorable personality whilst depending on how much is adapted the girl who had the exiled princess title may be making her appearance as well later.,1
death-march-to-the-parallel-world-rhapsody,"This anime had so much potential but they throw it out the window and make it a harem anime. This story is stupid. This was made to appeal to lonely losers who can't get a girlfriend. They could of made this into anime like log horizon. Anytime something awesome and exciting is about to happen, they writer was like ""Nope! Meaningful story or actions are overrated. We need more harem, where the main character can't make up his mind of what girl he want to be with"". Any meaningful plot or event in this anime that actually happen, it is only there to introduce a new love interest and it feels very lazy. They created an awesome world but don't know what to put into it. Just give me the writer's job and I can write a story thirty times better than this mess.",5

death-march-to-the-parallel-world-rhapsody,"Nothing at all new or groundbreaking here, but in the case of Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody, that doesn't end up being an enormous negative. Everything about this series, from the art to the character design, is very well done. There isn't a ton of action, so that might turn some people off, but I found each episode to be very nice and relaxing. DMttPWR doesn't try to be anything more than a pleasant escape to a fantasy world, and in that regard, it serves admirably.",5
death-march-to-the-parallel-world-rhapsody,"This was kind of a bummer for me. I was excited to see this was getting an anime originally but the obvious lack of money/quality and excessive lightening of the story made this pretty rough to watch. The light novel was already extremely light because of how crazy op the mc was and, unfortunately, they still went ahead and turned this mc into some boring af saint here. In the LN/WN he was insanely OP but still admitted he wan't able to save everyone, even to the point of being apathetic at times (didn't want to spend his ever waking moment saving people so he actually allow quite a bit of death to happen around him). He was also generally pessimistic and a frequent patron of brothels. Honestly, I don't think they could have made this story or these characters any more bland than they did in this anime. - 2.2/5",2
death-march-to-the-parallel-world-rhapsody,"To get it out of the way, yes this is yet another transported to another world where the hero is overpowered show.  That being said, I really enjoyed this one. In particular, the heroes interaction with the world through the menu.  It connected the character to the game world in a way that a lot of shows miss.  It also served as a creative plot device throughout the series.  The action is pretty minimal and rather anticlimactic, but that seems to be its intent.  It is closer to a slice of life anime with isekai overtones.I hope they continue the anime, but it doesn't look like there is a lot of hope.",4
death-march-to-the-parallel-world-rhapsody,"As a reader of the the web novel this adaption falls far short in comparison. It's like they changed it so that nothing bad could possibly happen so that Satou would be more perfect as if he wasn't completely willing to go to certain establishments in the web novel but seemed to feel guilty about it in the show. I understand that this was adapted from the manga that was adapted from the light novel, which itself was adapted from the web novel and that is bound to change how the story plays out to some degree. Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideBut it removes all death from the early parts rejecting the concept that satou can't possibly NOT save everyone. On top of all that, much of the slower parts seemed to be excessively dragged out while many of the fight scenes or other important parts seemed to be glossed or made to be so short as to be completely anticlimactic. I understand that as a level 310 being his fights should be over with quickly,  but it seemed short none the less. Finally, I understand that it's a cooking anime, but the enjoyable parts of cooking shows are never people eating the food (except maybe food wars if you're into that kind of thing), but rather making it something that was again changed from the web novel. the show seems to spend an inordinate amount of time on how he thinks unimportant dishes are made.  In short as a huge fan of the story I was hugely disappointed by the anime adaption that I probably wouldn't have finished if it weren't for the fact that I was a fan. That said I'm hopeful for a season 2 as the best arcs in the story are still yet to come.",2
death-march-to-the-parallel-world-rhapsody,"Taken on its own, this is a standard enough isekai OP MC. If you liked smartphone, this is a lot like that.As someone who's read the (translated) web novel, though, it feels like a step down? In the WN, the protag is generally clever, and efficient, and wins in a lot of cases through taking the initiative and making a decisive early move from the shadows. Here it seems like he spends a bunch of time dealing with the actions of shitty people, not the other way around. In general, it seems like his character in anime got eviscerated, prob to show off how strong he is because he can just brute force problems (and yeah ok that demonstrates how powerful you are, but it isn't exactly interesting) or to emphasize how ridiculous his harem is (true in WN too but with text you can just skip the parts that get boring to read).Dunno, feels less compelling following an MC who isn't smart in addition to powerful. If anime MC was real I'm not sure he deserves his power, in the WN he does (...mostly).",4
death-march-to-the-parallel-world-rhapsody,"The first episode gave me the impression that this would be a show where the MC goes on great adventures. Instead, he ends up with an ever-growing underage harem, and for some reason still manages to get into trouble and fight some monsters.They at least tried to give some of the cast a bit of character and backstory. I guess if you're into Moe you'll have a good time watching this. For me this was a bit too much and it started to annoy me.If you want to watch a show without ever worrying for the main character (except maybe how he's going to feed and clothe so many growing girls), this fits the bill.",4
death-march-to-the-parallel-world-rhapsody,"Our main character Ichirou Suzuki, a 29 year old programmer, is on a death march to make the release date on War World”a rpg game. After working nonstop for awhile, he  then falls asleep at his desk and finds himself in the world of the game, alone in a wasteland under attack by an army of typical video game lizard men. He then realizes he is a very high level and takes them out no problem at all. He decides its best to hide his level from players and attempt to live peacefully. Unfortunately things do not turn out the way he planed, as the games overall story catches up to him. This anime gives me feeling of nostalgia for sword art online, I love the character dynamics reminds me of the best of that series with its own spin on the platform it draws from being a fantasy world. Do give this a try if you are into fantasy anime you might be pleasantly surprised how refreshing this show is compared to those who came before it. It really comes down to this simple fact you ether like it or don't, I loved the first episode and what it set up for us for future episodes. Look forward to a full in depth review once the series comes to a full close, but for now this did entertain me. Episode 1: 8/10",5
death-march-to-the-parallel-world-rhapsody,"I had been sitting on this one as it didn't seem all that interesting after watching the first episode. Harem anime are not my thing, and, when this premiered, I was a little tired of the Isekai genre. Now, almost 2 years since it premiered, I took the time to watch it and found it quite enjoyable.Less of a harem and more of a gaggle of girls collected over time. Each adds a little bit to the group and make it very homey feeling (Even if a couple of them really want to 'get down' with the MC, who stops them at each opportunity).Story is interesting for the most part, has a few slowdowns.Definitely needs a second season. While this first season was a nice taste into the world and the characters, a second season could flush out characters more and continue/complete the story, making this a more rounded out anime, instead of an unfinished piece of work.Would give this a 3.5/5 if CR did half stars.",1
death-march-to-the-parallel-world-rhapsody,"I some knowledge of the series as I have read the manga and most of the WN and the only thing I can think of that would have made this show better is if they extended it to a two cour show.In most cases, people say that this show lack action and also it feels as if it was leading to something and just ends and they aren’t wrong. This show feels as if it was cut off since the show ends with the protagonist, Satou, finally starting his new journey and really not accomplishing much. In term of the whole story, this section of the story really only is the intro to the show. If I was to use the anime naruto as an analogy, the show ends on the journey to the land of wavers and this is before they run into the two ninjas that think they killed Kakashi and before naruto make the vow to never turn back and hesitate. Where the two cours would help the show is the fact that, just like the naruto analogy, the story really starts with the next arc. The story up to then was just the intro and from then on the actions and the story really picks up. It’s the fact that the story is still in the introduction of the story that makes it an average rated show.At least these are my thoughts of what would have made this show so much better.Even so, this is still one of the shows that I find my self watching multiple times as it is short and enjoyable.This is an isekai where protagonists is OP when compared to the average adventurer (even demon lords). The world he is put into is a familiar one as it is the world of games he has worked on except there are changes as he finds out that the world he is now in isn’t as fictional as the games he makes. Satou also finds himself building a harem of young girls( even though he isn’t a loli) and trying to find way to enjoy his time in the new world he is in.",5
death-march-to-the-parallel-world-rhapsody,"So, i am going to star with saying that i am a fan of the isekai genre and i pretty much watched every isekai anime that is out there. This anime is very good, it has good animations and an interesting concept as such as the companions, but the MC is straight up  trash, he is too soft and his voice in my opinion ticks me off. If the MC was a little bit tougher and if he had another voice actor then this anime would've been 10/10",4
death-march-to-the-parallel-world-rhapsody,"Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody was a surprisingly entertaining show which had me binge watching it due to its likable characters and relaxing tone.  While not genre redefining in any way, this show is a casual fantasy trip/wish fulfillment adventure with a main character who is self aware and funny enough to not be insufferable.  The surrounding harem is full of sweet and easy to root for individuals that covers the spectrum of archetypes.  Most of these harem members are actually treated with a lot more respect and platonic love than I was expecting from a show in this genre, and I would say that overall the harem at hand is a lot more wholesome.  Most of the dynamics in the group are rooted in admiration, adoration, and appreciation, rather than raunchy sex appeal.  There isn't eye popping levels of action or animation in this show, but I don't think that was this series's intention from the get go.  In my opinion, DMttPWR set out to be an easy to watch, low stress, give-you-a-fuzzy-feeling style retread of a common setting with lovable characters and a relatable MC who uses his powers to please his underprivileged harem members, rather than be an OP edge lord.  As someone who consumes a lot of shows in this sub-genre of anime, I'm glad that I got around to watching this show, and I can see myself returning to this series in the future when I'm in need of something to decompress with in between more intense and emotionally/mentally draining titles.",5
death-march-to-the-parallel-world-rhapsody,"I was not going to review this anime, but as I found myself at the end I could'nt help but want to full-heartedly recommend this anime. Its plot is familiar within the whole magically transported into a game genre yet it pleasantly separates itself from becoming a cliche on the genre. The characters are easily loveable and the protagonist, while seemingly like so many Hero-esque anime characters, also gives a different offering on his persona and demeanor. If you like Magic, Medieval and RPG type animes youll enjoy this one.",3
death-march-to-the-parallel-world-rhapsody,"It's a cute series with cute characters but ultimately I feel like it's kinda just a meh take on Isekai. There are some good things, but ultimately it's just an okay one so far, at least for me. Still I hope there will be a season 2 with more things happening, although I didn't mind that much it's peaceful and slower pace. Overall I'd give it a 7/10 or a 3.5/5. Cute but a bit bland. Also at least it's not Isekai Cheat Magician, so that's a plus.",2
death-march-to-the-parallel-world-rhapsody,It's an Isekai so you should know the premise already and this is also a harem anime as our hero saves many girls from slavery and befriends others. I really enjoyed this and it was fun to watch can only hope theirs more to come. It does have a bit of teaser fan service the English dub is real good and has interesting characters and magic powers. I'm giving a low 5 on here an a 8 on a 10 scale. I'd recommend it.,5
death-march-to-the-parallel-world-rhapsody,"It's pretty standard when it comes to isekai, but the plotlines are relatively believable, the characters make reasonable decisions, the animation isn't too bad, and while the action sequences tend to lack emotion, it's the interactions between the characters that really make this anime what it is. The entire point of this anime is to have something to go ""Awwwww"" to every time you pull it up. It's just cute for cuteness' sake and a good show to unwind to.",3
death-march-to-the-parallel-world-rhapsody,"Honestly, really awful. Not that I was looking for something with a particularly 'deep' philosophical meaning, just something that made sense. Half of the story lines are randomly introduced and not fully satisfied. There's extremely little development for anything going on. The 'romance' is lukewarm and seems like a throw in, which I honestly could have done without entirely. Also, the MC is supposedly overpowered but does VERY little to live up to that. I know he's trying to keep it under wraps and doesn't want to stand out, but for the level he is at compared to those he faces, seems like he has way too difficult of a time.",2
death-march-to-the-parallel-world-rhapsody,Anime has tons of Potential and i really am looking forward to a season 2! If they try making a season 2 they will blow up harder then sao. I love how he was so kind but the only downside is there wasn't too much action. Also even tho his meteor strike power is strong he only used it once which was at the start of the show which i got pretty upset about. Also another flaw was in the last episode when Satou said go find the guys who put those wood sticks in front of the driver so all the potions would spill. Later on when they meet back they completely skipped that part,4
death-march-to-the-parallel-world-rhapsody,"The only thing that subtracted from this anime was the main character. This mc was a living non playable character. No personality, no interesting quirks, no mischievous side, no overwhelming sense of JUSTICE, and no personal struggles other than being over-worked as a game developer when he was in the real world. But with that last tie to anything allowing us to invest in this guy gone we just have the equivalent of a very powerful sea urchin who is surrounded by women he will never get in any ""trouble"" with.He's a paper bag with the only layers to him being yet another paper bag. Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideHe even sleeps with a prostitute with no volition on his part. Like he wasn't busy so he didn't mind sleeping with her. He bought everyone's food and drink  in the bar to stop a quarrel and impressed, the woman took him by the arm and lead him upstairs like she was carrying up groceries and he doesn't say a word. Honestly, that prostitute was more of a player character than this mc. And seriously, he hadn't even touched his love interest in that way or any of his slaves which served to dampen or kill any tension that was meant build up because of these master-slave relationships.It was almost like watching an NPC navigate his way in a world full of real people - people that seem a whole lot more lively than him.Good points - everything and everyone else. Very lively medieval dungeon crawler mmorpg setting. A diverse array of slaves each with their own personalities, back stories, and circumstances that led them to work for the mc. Love interest who fights demons with the local army and with a couple of the mc's slaves build up and carry the tension on the mc's behalf. And lastly, a series of threats orchestrated by a demonic groups apposed to the Kingdom in which the mc is currently staying.There was still a story, progression, and many funny moments throughout. I also enjoyed how light this anime was.",4
death-march-to-the-parallel-world-rhapsody,Some of the haters obviously didn’t get that this show is quite beautiful. The protagonist is a humble yet strong MC that shows respect and sincerity through his actions and interactions throughout the anime and manga. Satou is industrious and pragmatic. His overpowering stats are used more for protection and safety and he keeps them well hidden towards most everyone.This show is really about enjoying life and helping those in need. This is not a typical harem and there is minimal fan service. In truth the manga which is still ongoing is much better but the anime is worth multiple seasons.,3
death-march-to-the-parallel-world-rhapsody,"This show has almost no internal character development, he plot is generic, and it is a harem of fan service. If you want some family love interactions then maybe you can enjoy this anime. Overall it is pretty abysmal. It is basically a lazier version than Sword Art Online. If you have an overpowered protagonist, you have to create a plot that shows growth and/or change in them. This show fails to do that.",3
death-march-to-the-parallel-world-rhapsody,"This story is a simple power-trip in a fantasy world. An overall light-hearted mood, and a MC who doesn't struggle much with anything. Some fights here and there, a few puzzles to solve at other times. It falls just short of being boring actually. A few things here and there keep raising the interest just - barely - over total boredom.Also, the pseudo-harem tends to drag things down. It brings nothing to the story, particularly when the character can instantly learn nearly any skill that catches his interest. This is not quite, but nearly as bad the ""smartphone"" guy from that other anime.",5
death-march-to-the-parallel-world-rhapsody,"The plot of this anime is a guy gets transported into a game, he kills a bunch of stuff and gets upped to a really insanely high level. Then he is perfect and goes around without a care in the world collecting women like it was the original pokemon. When I say ""flawless"" I mean he is perfect, at no point did I feel any tension for the main character because he was perfect. Since he is such a high level he gets unlimited skill points, and whenever he does ANYTHING he gets to level up that thing he just did so he's perfect at it. So if he say... Talks to someone, he is now perfect at talking to someone. If he deceives someone he is perfect at deceiving. If he runs he is now perfect at running. See where the problem is? He can instantly get perfect at anything, therefore whenever he or another character gets in trouble, my reaction always is ""Oh he'll get out of this"" instead of ""  I WONDER how he's going to get out of this."" Because he never fails, he never gets a single scratch. Since he is perfect I don't even bother wondering how he's going to get out of it. So you have a character that is perfect at fighting, at talking, at everything. And there are no threats to any of the characters. It's basically a kid's tv show with more fanservice. Actually, kids shows tend to have a problem they need to solve, and you're wondering how they're going to solve it... So this show is worse than the plot of most kids shows.",4
death-march-to-the-parallel-world-rhapsody,"Sometimes long reviews are unnecessary I've sometimes found and a bore to read. I've always taken the liking to watching a show to make my own determination and I'm glad I did that for this series.Thoroughly enjoyable and I can't wait for a season two to be announced. Great mixture of themes and genres rolled into one show, but not overbearing in any sense which is what makes it so fantastic. It's simple, yet intricate.5/5 stars to the creator and animation team.",4
death-march-to-the-parallel-world-rhapsody,"If you are able to enjoy a slower ""Tour of Europe"" or ""Medieval Eats"" approach to a fantasy anime, then you can enjoy this one. If you are looking for action and drama at every corner, then you'd better skip it. I really enjoy animes like this that take the time to show the beautiful scenery, and to describe life in detail. I enjoy watching animes like this as a real relaxing break. They had to cut out some of the original written story and sometimes things feels unexplained, rushed, or even pointless. In the web novel and LN, there is a progression and reason behind many things. I hear that they are not going to release a second season due to poor reception of the first season. I blame that more on poor execution than an actually bad story. I recommend you look up either the web novel (I believe this is free) or read the LN if you want to continue the story.",5
death-march-to-the-parallel-world-rhapsody,a beautiful concept the animation is so artistic. I just loved it. The opening was just remarkable. loved every episode. loved it! loved it! loved it! loved it! loved it! loved it! loved it !loved it!loved it! loved it! loved it !loved it!loved it! loved it! loved it !loved it!loved it! loved it! loved it !loved it!loved it! loved it! loved it !loved it!loved it! loved it! loved it !loved it!loved it! loved it! loved it !loved it!loved it! loved it! loved it! loved it! loved it! loved it! loved it !loved it!loved it! loved it! loved it !loved it!,2
death-march-to-the-parallel-world-rhapsody,"The review for the first episode says it all. A dude, our main character, works himself to death, literally, & ends up in an alternate world. So the story is simple & well executed. Our main guy goes to another world, its game like, he levels up a bunch, because basically he got lucky, & gave himself 3 mega spells or something. So he ends up killing a god right from the start of the game, & a ton of experience points & money, ironically it doesn't give him the title of ""Hero""That's one thing that sits this anime a little apart from other's, titles in it matter for some reason. Like they are the passcodes to success. Anyways, glad it exist, glad I watched it!",3
death-march-to-the-parallel-world-rhapsody,"The cover art turned me away from this anime at first because I thought this was just going to be a typical Parallel World Harem anime but, to my surprise it wasn't. I was the demeanor and the pacing of the story that really hooked me. The MC is very wholesome but, isn't an over reactive kid who just saw his first naked girl. He has morals but, he's an adult that isn't some pervert or an abstinent priest, despite his looks in the cover art (it'll make sense episode 1). There's your fair share of fan service but, it isn't constant or overbearing and, I also appreciate the details to the game functions and learning that required. Pacing was the other thing that got me hooked. It felt much slower than most animes as there wasn't always a fight after every other episode. It really reminded of Spice and Wolf in that sense. Also, although the plot is not very deep right now it feels as though the MC is really getting to exploring a new world. There are things happening but, it's not demanding like an imminent super villain attack/timebombesk situations that mark the end of the story. It really feels more real and akin a real life adventure where the MC can breathe, relax, learn and explore for more than 1 episode and enjoy his journey. If that's not for you I understand but for me it was a really nice change of pace.",4
death-march-to-the-parallel-world-rhapsody,"First,the characters over all don't have too much depth but aren't boring either.I don't mind how the main character acts, but the fact is his ""harem"" is built of women he saved from slavery. One girl is the main love interest and she has her own motives to as why she likes him other than that he saved her in battle.  The way he handles things is smart and not over baring.  Animation is no different than most, but defiantly takes the easy road which is fine.Story is simple, but the underlining stories are harder to see if you are just watching and not paying attention. These small details are what made it interesting.",5
death-march-to-the-parallel-world-rhapsody,"Do you like harem animes? Do you like to see a lead character not constantly acting like an incompetent or unconfident perv? Do you dislike fan service? Okay, maybe this is a niche anime given that it's basically a harem anime mostly without the fan service elements, but I love it. Finished watching it in two days and can't wait for a second season. The main character finds ways to manipulate the alternate world based on his experiences as a software engineer of MMOs and from the MMOs he's played in the past. He doesn't get needlessly confused in situations and seems to grasp what people are trying to communicate even when they're bad at communication. Acting like a proper 29 year old (at least in his head), he does play dumb for the sake of appearances since he knows he looks 15 and shouldn't reveal all his cards at once. The story gets a little deeper when he starts finding hard evidence that what he's been doing has not been a dream in his head all along.",4
death-march-to-the-parallel-world-rhapsody,"This is a great show to do a quick binge on! I know I have binged it several times and I am eagerly awaiting a sequel. The show stays true to the genre pretty thoroughly and adds some fun things too. Only thing that I could see that throws people off is the whole moral aspect, which is non-issue if someone thinks about the world the MC finds himself in anyway. For more depth I put a quick description of the layout of this in a spoiler tag below.Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hide We meet 5 of the characters as slaves in this fictional world whom, by various means, are rescued and attached to the MC. In return, MC accepts them and carries on with the plotline. In a couple different episodes he mentions that he wishes he could free them, but that the girls in question get upset if he tries to do so and so he just keeps them as slaves in name. He treats them well and they all enjoy a series of adventures. Some real life people have gotten very verbally upset at the show ""for promoting child slavery"" which has led to questions about whether there should be a second season. The thing is that if the show called them servants instead of slaves then there would be no correlation; thus I find it to be a non-issue.",4
death-march-to-the-parallel-world-rhapsody,"it's within my opinion that this anime is actually well done shark though seemingly playing is not as far as I'd say well-executed but done far better than some as well as the progression storyline even what would be qualified as the fluff episode it's not my favorite but it's neither the worst I've ever seen nor is it exceptionally good I would say it has a sufficient for both plot and the evolution of internal characterization did I would legitimately want to see hopefully done correctly which is why I'm giving it a good review the back fact I can be hooked in such a way where I would wish to continue,  instead of tolerating it or leaving it as is for me is a compelling reason. Especially considering, nowadays the plethora of choices one is given with varying forms of anime in general.",5
death-march-to-the-parallel-world-rhapsody,"Truly great story. Even though the manga and light novel are better, and this leaves out a lot of details from the manga, and the manga changes a lot from the light novel, the anime is still great.  The implementation of him being overpowered may be generic, but not many escape with a good story a long with it, and the fact that he is really nonchalant is nice, even though I myself would like it if he showed off a little more, I feel like he's unappreciated, and that't not that bad, but I kind of feel bad for him. Anyways, I recommend that if you enjoyed this, that you check out the manga, and definitely the light novel.",4
death-march-to-the-parallel-world-rhapsody,"I watched this through VRV and I really enjoyed it. .  Not so much for the action, as commenters in other places have mentioned, Satou is really quite OP.  However, this is really enjoyable in view of a slice of life anime/harem. Satou's interactions with the other girls are adorable sometimes, and the ways that he solves issues are quite creative. I really enjoyed this, and hope they make a second season.  As for some people commenting about the child slavery,  It is something that happened in the past.  you cant change history, but you can darn well forget it.  I'm glad that they made reference to it, but didn't abuse it.  the girls are quite happy serving him, and even if they were free, the way he treats them earned loyalty.  As to the sometimes singe focused ...ahem... appetites of some of the girls...  its just what you gen in an ecchi anime. if its not what you like, dont watch.  But if it does appeal to your tastes in anime, its a great show, and well worth the time to watch.",3
death-march-to-the-parallel-world-rhapsody,I used to watch anime all the time but then the shows I was watching ended or went in a direction I didn't enjoy. For about two years I have occasionally been looking for new anime shows to get into. Finally with this show it has made want to watch more. I can't wait for a second season of this show. I love all the characters and humor and the plot is intriguing. This show is a masterpiece of light-hearted fantasy.,5
death-march-to-the-parallel-world-rhapsody,"I believe that the complaints of the majority of people are base in a partial apreciation of the story; as any adaptation of any light novel it cannot show all the interesting tidbits that it could, but even so you can feel the main and funny essence. Some peoples say that you need to be already a fan to like it, I disagree, in my case I first watch the anime, read the anime and latter the light and web novel, and still consider the anime awesome a little short but awesome. It is true that the ideal would have been 24 or episode from the get go, because in essence one complaint had support in reality, it feel just like the ""prologue"", and in a way they are right,  but in this beginning your already have action, comedy, a lot of story, and world development, that make it feel like a beginning to something even better.I found that some people just focus in the same critics that with any isekai anime or story,  instead to find HOW are they diferent? completely recommended you will have fun that it is at the end the true objective of this media.",3
death-march-to-the-parallel-world-rhapsody,"* I do not read the Light Novels.  I am a fan of the formula; MC travels to a different or parallel world and gains godlike powers/abilities. Afterward, the MC starts attracting women through different circumstances and scenarios. And boom you have a harem. The problem lies with the main character who is not interesting and much of the problem is because of some of the skills he has and uses. There is no sense of excitement in his actions or voice. I understand he is a programmer and programs video games for a living but come on you got transported to a fantasy world. The rest of the crew is likable but not enough to pull the weight of the show. The art is decent most of the time but dips hard at some points. There are some great musical set pieces which I enjoyed. I would not recommend you to watch and sit through the 12 episodes because by the end you only want it to be over.",4
death-march-to-the-parallel-world-rhapsody,"When the first few episodes started airing on Crunchyroll, I was SO EXCITED.Each week, I would eagerly wait for the next episode to come out.However, this excitement soon diminished after around episode 5.That's because I felt like the plot was not going anywhere. It started getting boring. The main character kept learning useless skills and going on what seemed to be boring side quests.On the plus side, the opening and ending are SO GOOD. Seriously, even if you aren't going to watch the anime, just listen to the OP and END.",5
death-march-to-the-parallel-world-rhapsody,"Normal dude from our world gets transported to another world where the magical reason of the day decides he's suddenly OP in this world and can go around being awesome and picking up all the ladies. We've definitely seen this before, but I enjoy the characters here and the world they've created is pretty fun to explore. The main character is also someone who explicitly has a job in the real world that they were good at and doesn't just say ""yes! My boring life is over! Time to be amazing"" the second he gets a chance; he evaluates his options and actually decides to just go with the flow to at least see what this world has to offer to expand his horizons. That's an admittedly-minor detail that I really appreciate after the slew of useless nerds from other shows suddenly become the most intelligent and charismatic people on the face of the magical planet. I've seen people complain that a number of the characters are slaves who used to be owned by an abuser and the protagonist did not technically free them when they joined his party, but I feel they handled the matter respectfully enough despite the understandable knee-jerk reaction most people have upon hearing the word ""slave."" Anyway, take what I'm about to say as the *massive* nitpick it sounds like, but I refuse to let this one slide. I am so annoyed that whoever subtitled this anime insists on calling the main character Satou. Satou was his name in the real world, yes, but the show makes it abundantly clear that this world is having him use his lazy gaming alias of Satuu. The magical background check stone calls him that, he introduces himself as that, and everyone calls him Satuu if you actually listen to them before writing the subtitles. I probably would have let it slide with a minimal amount of grumbling to myself if it hadn't literally become a plot point that one of the girls calls him Satou before they know each other which leads him to believe that she's Japanese and ask some followup questions! Good luck picking up on that one if you aren't familiar with Japanese names and are just watching this because it's a random anime you happened to stumble across. I'll stop myself there and just say that this is kind of a pet peeve of mine.",4
death-march-to-the-parallel-world-rhapsody,"This show has it's moments. And at times these moments are entertaining but those moments are few and far between. I cannot help but feel the tropes that plague most of these isekai shows are on a checklist and the creators of this show just ran down said list and said yes to every single one.Overpowered protagonist who has the ability to become god-tier and everything? Check.Harem of lolis that follow him around and even call him master? check.No foe to equal him in strength, skill, or even cunning? guh..check... It is one thing where the protagonist has some advantage over everyone else, it's another when the protagonist is already godlike in his power and the show is in on it. But to have the protagonist go ""I don't know how to do X, better chunk some skill points into it.."" and end up a master who knows all there is to know about X is really weak writing. It's depressing because there is no sense of danger for this character, nothing to bring any urgency unless Harem gurl 1 gets her panties in a twist and needs rescuing. I kept watching this show with the hopes that something would get better as time went on, but it just didn't. What is worse is how the show just abruptly ends, there's no real closure just this ""Hey we did this thing and now we're off again!""If you're one who really enjoys Isekai shows, and wishes for more this show should fit the bill. Just don't expect great things.",1
death-march-to-the-parallel-world-rhapsody,"The first burning question I have is: why is bland anime protagonist #3 now a game programmer? He does almost zero coding over the course of the entire Isekai adventure. Sure during the last arc he looks into how magic works and makes some sort of comparison, but none of it makes sense, and he only does it twice. Compare this to Knight's & Magic, where everything the main character does and how the plot unfolds is a result of his background from our world. Even worse is the main character here immediately upon waking up comments that it looks like the game he's currently working on, and then HAS NO IDEA how any of the mechanics work. He even has to ask about how magic works. When he should know even more than anyone else. Heck, he even forgets to turn on obviously useful skills when there doesn't seem to be a limit on how many he can have on (side note, why would that even be a thing in a game?).Speaking of skills, why does he keep getting them for literally everything he does? Or that some bull happens and he's suddenly super high level with enough skill points that he can max out almost all of them immediately? All of the tension is immediately robbed from the story and I see no reason to worry or get invested. And then he goes off and hides his amazing prowess for no discernible reason that I can see.Also, why make him a 30 year old dude and then age him down to 15 once he gets to the ""parallel world""? So its less creepy when he gets a loli harem? Despite the fact that you had him state explicitly in our world that he isn't into lolis? Not only that, but he expressed a contentment with working and not having romantic interests, so how is it wish fulfilment that he suddenly has a harem?The show would have made so much more sense if before waking up he had previously been a lonely chef in some run down restaurant who never played games before, before he woke up and came to the parallel world. It would explain his lack of gaming competence, his panic, why we should view all the girls as a good thing, his obsession with food, his desire to be a merchant instead of anything else. Nothing lines up in this show's narrative and it totally wastes the main selling point of most of the trailers, that he is a GAMES PROGRAMMER that wakes up in a game world, his game world specifically.I haven't even touched on the pacing issues, the absolute lack of tension.It feels like everything the show does is to simply tick off check boxes. I really hope someone picks this up to abridge it.All that being said, despite the waste of potential it doesn't do anything particularly offensively bad, so that's why it got two stars instead of one.",5
death-march-to-the-parallel-world-rhapsody,"I'll start off by saying yes, it is another OP MC who ends up in a new crazy (video-game) world. But no, it's not stupidly generic like some of the other shows out there.I loved the OT and ED, the music was awesome! The character's were all cute and the setting was cool, too. Okay, I'll admit this shouldn't get 5 stars if we base our reviews on animation quality alone. But, it was more than bearable for me and the story is amazing. It's nothing overly unique but, the show is so easy-going that I couldn't get enough of it. Thinking of getting these LNs when I have the time.",4
monster-strike,"Now, if you're reading reviews, chances are you've read the anime summary. If, like me, the only thing in the summary that intrigued you was protagonist's memory loss, then this ISN'T the anime for you. In 50 short (under 10 minutes) episodes, the contents of the lost memories - the recovery of which becomes the protagonists' main motivating factor in the series - is NEVER REVEALED TO THE AUDIENCE. All you get are hints. You don't even find out why Ren Homura's hair changes to red and he can remember some of the memories he's lost while in the midst of battle. The two  biggest  questions you have from the first episode and they're never answered.I only watched the end to find out what was so special about the memories only do be denied - I honestly feel I've wasted hours of my life. That's why I decided to write this review, so nobody else has to do the same.(Looking around, it seems as though the answers MIGHT be revealed in the movie - if they are, I wish I'd known sooner and would've just watched that instead of this miserable series.)Outside of the unfulfilled lost-memory-premise the only thing this anime has is the monster battles which imo really aren't that great - the protagonists themselves don't do much - the battle system consists of the player touching their smart phone's screen, pulling their finger back to create a slingshot of energy, then flinging their monsters into battle. In first few episodes it seems as though there's a strategy of getting certain angles and finding weakspots, but that mostly disappears after a couple episodes. The monsters, some of which DO have their own personalities, pretty much take it from there. People who play the game the anime is based off of might get more out of this - assuming the monsters are based off real ones in the game, you'll get to see them battle it out with each other. Other than that, I personally wouldn't recommend it anyone.",2.5
monster-strike,"For those who don't know what Monster Strike (MS) is, it's a mobile game that combines pinball and slingshot aspects to fight monsters (same way how it is in the anime, but with AR). Other than that, the gameplay is quite similar to Puzzle & Dragons. The anime caught my interest so well within the first couple of episodes with their comedic parts and 4th wall breaks that were pretty amusing. People seem to get the wrong idea for why each episode is 8-10 minutes. These are ONAs, which means it's a web series and not a full length television anime. I was really into it but lost a lot of interest when season 2 came out. Don't get me wrong by the star rating, season 1 and the movie was worth the watch, but I regretted watching season 2 and onwards.Season 1: The story follows Ren Homura, a guy who has no memory of his past. He meets a group of people(Oragon, Aoi, Akira and Minami) who apparently also have amnesia but are somewhat familiar with each other only vaguely. They meet through MS of course. The anime introduced a secret underground, team-based MS competition with battling CG monsters that I had hoped it had more of. I had a lot of Dragon Drive vibes from it at first and I was interested in that. Instead, it focused more on the outside world where people are just picking fights. The goal of Ren and his team was to regain their memories and uncover secrets hidden in the past as people tell him to do or not to do so rather than just telling him and making things easier, because plot. It ended up becoming a ""fight in the name of friendship"" cliche and left us with a lot of plot holes like what happened in the past or why Ren's hair changes red in some cases. In my opinion, I enjoyed this season till the near end. 8/10The Movie: Best watched after season 1. By far, the best of the best for MS. This fills a lot of season 1's plot holes, since it's set four years before the present time. It explains their memory loss, their familiarity of the game, and their relationships with each other. It again follows Ren and his crew, replacing Akira with Haruma, as he searches for remnants of his father, who disappeared three years prior, and keeps a certain dragon away from baddies. A lot of emotional aspects were implemented throughout the movie, which I found effective and the plot was more straightforward compared to season 1. It still kinda throws you off since it didn't mix with season 1's finale so well. 8.5/10Season 2: Everything was animated in CGI (not that I hate it or anything but since it started as 2D, it would've been better if it stayed consistent). Monsters are now roaming free in the real world. The Ren I knew has died and I hate the new one, personality-wise. A new character, Mana, was introduced and I didn't like how it centered around her so much. I very much did not like how easy it was for her to take Aoi's spot as Ren's love interest. K's seriousness was immediately replaced to goofball. We hardly ever got to see the side characters introduced in season 1 (and when we did, they were 2D and not CG as if the main characters were monsters if you get what I mean). It became a monster hunt and nothing about that underground battle plaza... I wanted a tournament or something along the line in this season! 3/10The Fading Cosmos: We're back to 2D MCs for some reason. Ren's personality regains some season 1 aspects, but still got tainted from the last season. Mana has practically become the center of gravity in this one. The world is about to end and the fate of it lies on her. Ren has completely forgotten about Aoi at this state as she becomes a supporting character along with Akira, Minami and Oragon, and he gets even closer to Mana (poor Aoi, she even had a chance in one of the episodes of season 2; I blame the director change for that one). Basically, everything here got ruined because of the previous season. We are left with a cliffhanger and I fear of what comes next. I'm sure some people would like the ending of this, but in my opinion, I don't. 4/10Overall, I would just say, definitely watch season 1 and the movie, but be wary of what comes afterwards, cuz it's a whole different thing beyond that.",1
monster-strike,"I took an interest to the show because it held similarities to digimon/puzzles and dragons x ect ect ect. The added bonus of the missing memories which introduced an epic storyline showed great promise as well.Season 1 : Each episode is only 8 minutes long which makes it hard to get invested in the show. Ren's memorie are never recovered (you discover them in the movie at least). You never find out why his hair changes color when he activates the game which seemed super important since when his hair turned red he seemed to recall his past better. The moment they get new monsters, either the original ones are never to be seen again or the newly acquired ones are never to be seen again after being acquired. Other then using your phone to launch your monster at other monsters, only the first few episodes really focused on the angles of shots for extra damage.Season 2 : We are now suddenly in 3D and K is over the top nutty professor barely ever mentioning his son Haruma or his wife who was the while point in season 1. The whole focus of teams of 4 is thrown out the window ehen a 5th player is brought into the group. Oragon is also demoted to sidekick comical relief who never battles. Second half of the season is 2D and past characters of season 1 show up out of no where to help at the end.Monster strike the movie : omg one of the only things i actually enjoyed most of. Seeing the game in development and the crew as kids being testers was great. Akira going back in time and seeing Oragon in his true form the entire time also great. The fact the parents werent out searching for their kids once they escaped the research lab, wtf? Otherwise good movie.Spin off MSSonic: seems at this point monsters are fully assimilated in Japan and it focused entirely on different monsters trying to become idols. Lucie is the only character that is recurring but somehow she's no longer with Haruma and not explained why. Not bad for a stand alone spin off for music lovers. Hated the 3D performances.I do wish they would explain Ren's red hair when he uses the game and also cover what happened to his father.",3
monster-strike,"As far back as I can remember, I've enjoyed animated shows where something arbitrary is used to save the world. Yu-Gi-Oh ZeXal (subbed) and Bakugan (dubbed) come to mind. Naturally, when this animation came onto the scene, I was stoked to watch it.It had everything: interesting mysteries, quirky characters, and a decent setup for a plot (in this case, the missing memories... and the mystery of Ren's color-changing hair XD). As MS went on, it kept getting better. More questions, vague answers and an interesting conflict, since the protagonist's goal is being hindered by the team member he replaced.Nothing could go wrong, right?Wrong.Starting from the second story arc (where the main cast go on a quest to find Haruma, an old teammate), I felt something was wrong. The plot felt wackier- more... padded and slow.Since I heard about the 3DS game (sadly, no localization ;_;) having a similar story to the animation, I watched a Japanese Youtuber play through it and I enjoyed the story- or what I could infer from it.Oh my gosh, that ending! That was perfect! Cheesy, but perfect! The villain was threatening, as was the final arc for the story! This was a great game!Back to the ONA, though. The short episodes made me come back for more. Since there was nothing major happening, it felt like I was being led on- lead to become hyped for a major twist near the end.This is where the show just throws itself off a cliff.The War Gods sounded interesting, and I was expecting the show to invoke the Eldritch Abomination trope. Sadly, they just turned out to be humanoid gods with flashy CGI powers. Their battles were kinda lowering my standards for the show, too- often relying on comedy to keep you watching.And then there's the final arc of the story- where the hero and his partner must stand against all odds to defeat the great evil they defeated in the past. Being a fan of how the 3DS game's climax went, I was pumped after such stagnant episodes. It was at this moment, that I grew to despise the animated series.Among many of the problems with the final arc, there was the fact that Oragon's true form was never revealed (he's just a massive flaming dragon, woo-hoo...), the contents of the characters' memories never being revealed (literally, it's the same shot of them playing together as kids over and over) and the final showdown not being as climactic as I had hoped (the hero literally gets shot with energy bullets... and just sits there while the runtime for the episode dwindles.... only to come back out of nowhere and win). Also, Ren's hair changing color was never explained.I know that the ""movie"" is the climax to the series itself. And, sure, it explains a lot of plot holes in the series itself. But I would've liked this closure in the series proper!!""But Manga!"" you say. ""This is intended for people who play the game! Not you!""Shut your yap. If it's a Japanese cartoon, I'm watching. Nuff said.Also, I would have liked for Oblivion (final boss of the 3DS game) to have been the big bad of the animated series. As a one-eyed bio-mechanical monster of doom and destruction, he looked threatening- more threatening than a white-haired, red-eyed shirtless dude with standard magic powers and creepy rocks.Overall, Monster Strike is an animated series that some people may like. But personally- and a LOT of people agree with me on this- I think it's a worthless pile of garbage.This show deserves at least 2 stars for a good concept, but its flaws (mainly in my opinion) that nullify that second star.Don't watch unless you want to be irritated.",1
monster-strike,This anime is... is... truth be told i am not entirely sure how to explain it. It has its cringy moments but it also has its shining jewels that have me laughing like an idiot.This show is entirely aware of the fact that it is basically a commercial for the game and rolls with it. That very fact both makes and breaks the show at the same time. It gets lazy in some places but in others you can see where the creators had their fun and rolled with it. However that being said its positives greatly out weigh the negatives and i at least recommend this at least a try.,1
monster-strike,"Bout 10 episodes in and you have one stroy line. Next episode it switches to some other random story with no explanation as to what the sam hell is going on. I was trying to put up with the animation style of this and was hoping for a good story regardless. I was left confused, annoyed and bewildered as to where the main story even went. I don't know if it continues again later on. But i'm not wasting my time on something that was directed quite horribly.",3
monster-strike,"I've noticed one thing in particular about this show, you either love it or hate it.  Me, i loved it, I think the whole premise and plot are something new and different.     The first season focuses on Ren Homura and his missing memories and a game called Monster Strike, which is an actual smartphone game, not available in English anymore after a short year of being out.  The episodes are pretty short in the first season, about 6-8 minutes but that is why it's called a short anime.  This anime makes constant references and parodies of other anime, video games and the likes and it's really fun!   The second season picks up where the first leaves off but watch the movie first before watching the second season otherwise, you will be out of order chronologically.  The 2nd season starts to use CG animation that some viewers either hated or liked, I liked it because it gave the animators the ability to accomplish some really awesome looking scenes and monsters.  The episodes start to get longer now in the second season more like 13 minutes an episode.    The third season  just began and there is even a side-story series of 5 episodes called MSonic that follows a cat-girl wanting to be an idol with various MS characters making appearances.     Monster Strike is a really fun anime to watch, it's not the deepest of stories but it is very intriguing and pulls you in.  Don't listen to all the haters, make your own decision about the show after watching a couple of the short episodes.     P.S. These reviews are mostly negative but the episode ratings are all 4-5 stars, that doesn't add up right, the show is much better than some reviewers give it credit for.",2
monster-strike,"First season was meh. It began with Ren's lack of memories being a major driving force in the plot, then completely abandoned that in the subsequent 51 episodes, where it turned into some innocent show about friendship and conquering adversities together. Each episode only being 8 minutes long also prevented any major plot developments from happening, and every episode felt slightly rushed. Good moments here and there but overall very boring. Then came season 2 which uses the crappy CGI animation that we're seeing in so many low-budget shows. They introduced a new chick who is just completely annoying, depicting her as some ditzy american transfer student. She's always doing stupid stuff and then saying ""My friend told me this is how you do it in Japan!"", I mean seriously after episode 3 it's already become an overused joke and she's still doing it. Her and Ren are the embodiment of ""power through friendship"" and it's very cheesy watching them interact. They keep introducing new characters, mainly monsters, but none of them are interesting at all. One of them has a f*cking rice cooker as a head, I'm not even joking. Slow plot development, cliched motives, and bad animation make this season even worse than the first. Then out of nowhere we get a movie. And this movie has proper 2D animation with beautiful rendering, a structured and developed story, and focused on Ren's past and even gives flashbacks to his dad and how he met everyone in the series. Is this a joke? Why is the movie so well made when the show is crap?? There's such a stark contrast between the movie and the show that I have no idea what the producers want Monster Strike to be. Is it supposed to be a laid back action comedy, or a serious battle anime?The 1 star rating is for the show, not the movie. I can't accept them as being part of the same story.EDIT: So now we have season 3, which is about a cat-girl wanting to be a pop idol?? It supposedly takes place within the same universe as the other seasons, but makes no reference to the MonsterStrike phone game which is what defines the whole series. Seriously, what is this show trying to be?? This season looks completely disjointed from the other two, it really should just be separated from Monster Strike as a standalone. Part of me even believes that it IS supposed to be a separate show, and that CR put it here as a mistake. As confused as Monster Strike already was, it didn't need this 3rd season making it even worse. If I were you, I'd just watch the movie and avoid everything else. The movie is the only thing that resembles a solid story.",1
monster-strike,So the animation in the first season was good but that is the only positive thing about this show. Story had potential to be really good but fell flat the longer the show went on and one of the reasons for it is due to run time. Something like this does not work with each episode being 8 to 9 minutes long. Plot was sacrificed for long battle scenes and ending credits. Season 2 changes to full blown cg which was a huge waste of money and just fugly to look at. This anime made me sad.,1
monster-strike,"One of the things I hate most about anime is the multitudes of truly idiotic characters. I only watched about four minutes of the first episode of this anime, but the mc came across as incredibly stupid. The whole premise of the beginning of this anime is a mc who is returning to where he grew up after losing his memory. On his way to school, he has a flashback of seeing a dark haired girl crying by a tree. While he is introducing himself in the classroom, his eyes are drawn to a dark haired girl. After school she comes up to him and asks if they have ever met before because he looks familiar. His reply? ""I don't think we have ever met before."" What!!!! How could you possibly know that???? Your memory is gone!!!!! The pure idiocy of that statement totally turned me off. If you can stomach stupid characters or smart characters that say incredibly stupid things from time to time (as I said at the beginning, I didn't watch long enough to know which one this mc is), give this a try. If you're like me, you probably want to steer clear of this...",4
monster-strike,"it could have been good if they didn't rush the story line, or have main characters annoying self monologue. they also pretty much ripped off DEVIL SURVIVOR, with out adding any of what made DEVIL SURVIVOR watchable. All in all this is a total fail, the story line gets a 0, the animation is spotty in some areas will give it a 1, originality gets a 0 (which should get a -2). if it was done properly this could have been a funny and entertaining, but sadly they missed the mark.",1
isekai-cheat-magician,"Originally, seeing the title, I thought ""Cheat"" meant that the main characters somehow knew how to cheat magic somehow and I thought that would be an interesting concept to explore... Nope... It's just two very overpowered protagonists like in every other Isekai. The unique thing these anime bring to the table is how incredibly standard this is. I've never seen an anime bring so little to the table. I love Isekais, but this one is nothing new at all. It's not awful though. It's still enjoyable, but it doesn't present anything new or exciting. Every Isekai at least has something unique... *How Not to Summon a Demon Lord: Presents a VERY VERY Overly sexy appeal. *Overlord: The main protagonist is actually an antagonist *That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime: Loveable characters, incredible humor, the main character is a slime instead of some generic OP magician. *The Rising of the Shield Hero: The main character expects a fun and exciting adventure, but is treated with the harsh realities of hatred, false rape accusations (and every other accusation is put on him), dealing with slavery, etc. *Re:ZERO: Protagonist has no fighting abilities whatsoever and has a unique personality. The only power he has is being revived after death, and returning to his ""save point"". Begins to suffer through trauma as he fails to rescue his friends from being brutally murdered and must overcome that trauma to prevent death from happening after he revives again.*Konosuba: Nothing much but an incredibly unique and hilarious cast of characters which makes up for the whole anime. *Wise Man's Grandchild: Very quickly shift between cute and wholesome themes with unexpectedly dark and twisted themes. Also not a Harem. The main character actually starts to date someone, which is finally a nice twist on the typical ""harem but the main character doesn't actually date anybody""*Saga of Tanya the Evil: A little girl who in a previous life was a strict middle-aged businessman. Revived as a baby girl in a parallel universe with ""wizards"" that's going through their version of World War II. The main character*Isekai Quartet: Literally just Overlord, Konosuba, Re:ZERO, and Saga of Tanya the Evil taken to a generic school life. What more can you ask for?*In Another World With My Smartphone: A harem anime that makes you question Polygamy, lol.Every Isekai that I've seen has brought something new, fun, or unique to the table. Sometimes, it's just so funny that it's unique in that way. But if you try to imagine a plot of a typical Isekai, then you've already perfectly guessed the Isekai Cheat Magician storyline... At least the first two episodes. I'm hoping that this anime develops into something more unique, but I doubt it. It's a good show to watch when you're doing pretty much nothing, but don't expect a lot out of it. You know it's a little bit sad when this anime is unique due to how it standard and generic it is.UPDATE: I wrote this review during the release of the first two episodes, and I'm currently writing this after finishing episode 6. My worst fear was that this anime wouldn't bring anything new to the table. Yet, it's somehow worse than that. I thought that the anime would at least have decent characters, decent pacing, etc., but it's only getting worse every episode. Currently, the plot is WAY too predictable. They give such obvious hints to plot twists. This anime doesn't engulf the viewer at all either. In one episode, Taichi & Rin are fighting in two different battle right next to each other, but when they showcase one battle, there are absolutely no signs that the other battle even exists. There's giant beasts being summoned, huge explosions. Yet, in each fight, nobody notices anything going on with the other fight. It feels like they're in completely separate locations when they're actually right next to each other. The character development is pretty awful too.  POST-EPISODE 5 SPOILERS:  Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideAn assassin - Anastasia - is spared by the Taichi after she tries to assassinate her. She's kept in a prison to... reflect on her actions...? A few days later, she's now this beautiful green-haired woman with gigantic breasts (how was she a ""ninja-dressed"" assassin before??) who is suddenly a 100% good character...? Why?? The anime could have at least given some backstory as to why she decided to switch sides so suddenly. Switching sides for the simple reason of ""the protagonist spared me"" never happens in a good show. . POST-EPISODE 6 SPOILERS:  Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideSimilarly to the Anastasia situation, there are these two twin children who are evil and summon hundreds of red goblins. The second that they realize that they can't control them, they suddenly just switch sides to the protagonist's side. This is even more ridiculous than the Anastasia situation. Anastasia at least had time to reflect a little bit for a few days (despite not telling us any backstory about it). For the twins, they switch sides because... they lost control of the goblins that they summoned...? What happened to ANY of the affiliations with the villains that they were with? On top of this, Taichi doesn't suspect them at all and goes along with this show's terrible pacing and is like ""lol well they're good guys now. Let's just let them wander around the city.""  The pacing is only getting worse. This is technically an Episode 6 spoiler, but they build something up so much for Rin, and it's completely underwhelming when she actually does it. I'll mark this as a spoiler regardless, but reading this will only spare you from being disappointed.  Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideBefore the war with the monsters, Rin comes up with this huge plan combining science and magic. Everyone is all like ""wow this is super fascinating, we'll trust you!"" (She also explains the plan during the meeting. What SHOULD OF went down is that the storyboard team should have hinted to us that she had a plan, and then while she executes the plan, multiple flashbacks should have gone back to explain what the plan was while she's casting it. Telling us the plan from the very start destroys a lot of that suspense) The plan that Rin executes comes in 3 parts: First, a giant earth attack. Second, a giant water attack, and third, a giant fire attack. The fire attack, in the end, brings the whole plan together and is supposed to kill a huge majority of the enemies in the war. But what the animators made it look like (unintentionally) is when she casted the huge earth attack, it made it look like that she already obliterated most of the army with that one attack. The other steps are casted anyways, and the number of enemies barely change. Yet, everyone around her is like ""WOW THAT GENIUS 3-SPELL PLAN WORKED!"" To make it worse, they then animate all of the adventurers running off to attack the remaining army. The remaining army looks like they were never even hit by anything. The continuity in this whole show is god awful. Post-Episode 6 Conclusion: I began watching this anime and I kept watching it in hopes that it would derive from the standard Isekai formula and be unpredictable it certain times. Now, I'm still watching this every week to see how much worse this show gets so I can enjoy cringing at it. The characters, plot, pacing, and so much more is just laughably awful, and is only getting worse by each episode. This is the PERFECT anime for you if you want to learn how to not direct and write an anime.",2
isekai-cheat-magician,"The fact that when i wrote this review this show is sitting at 2.9 is misleading. This show without a shadow of a doubt is the most garbage tier anime ive seen in my whole life. I love my isekais dont get me wrong. But when u literally put zero effort into making an anime interesting you give the whole genre a bad rep. Ive seen a lot of anime, and this is hands down one of the worst ive seen. I came from the app onto the main website and logged in just to write a bad review on this and i never write reviews.",2
isekai-cheat-magician,"If you're experiencing deja vu combined with nausea when watching this anime, you're having the right reaction. You've both seen this before---a lot of times---and done much,.much better. Step One: Xerox a copy of a decent isekai.Step Two: Remove interesting characters or plot points and insert stereotypes you've seen at least a million times before. Step Three: Remove any dialogue that makes sense and insert lines stolen from an emo teenagers' secret diary. Go for extra nonsensical angst.Step Four: Review the result and  further prune away anything remotely interesting until you have a blended mish-mash of cardboard puree that lacks any taste whatsoever.I honestly think that this is what happens when you let the teenagers who write fan-fiction have a budget.",1
isekai-cheat-magician,"This anime's plot and characters are basically copy and pasted from the isekai genre and you can tell there was little thought put into creating the characters. The plot is so basic that you can summarize it with only the title ""Isekai Cheat Magician"", it is about a high school boy and girl that go to another world and are the most powerful magicians from the start. there is barley any in depth plot except what is needed to even have a plot.",1
isekai-cheat-magician,"Are you tired of yet another Isekai anime? No? Well give this one a shot because you will never want to watch another one again.If you took all the clichés of this genre and anime in general, could you find another way to show it to the audience that was new?Well, they succeeded.  No one ever made one that was this flat, this unemotional, and this pointless. Everything is compatibly done:  The drawing, the action, and the music. But the story and characters are just bad.  You will be board watching it and tomorrow you will wonder what the anime was about because you can't really remember anything from it.  This is the most honest waste of your time that has ever occured in anime.  There is no bad to remember, but there is no good either.  The 22 minutes of your life you spend watching this will just be a black hole in your memory.",1
isekai-cheat-magician,"I have literally no idea why the title of the anime is what it is because despite him being wanked by literally everyone he can't do anything. Basically if you told your 12 year old cousin what an isekai anime is, this is what he'd come up with. Every character is so flat and boring I honestly cannot remember their names despite watching every episode. I suppose its SOMETHING to watch but that's about the highest compliment I can offer for this show.",2
isekai-cheat-magician,"For an Isekai show its very... average.  The plot and character development are not very well written, the pace is ever so slightly off all the time, and it's hard to drum up enough of a reaction to care about what happens next.I had a lot of hope for this show after episode one, but after five episodes I'm so completely underwhelmed by the whole thing I find myself hard pressed to watch episode six.Overall its just, well.. a little boring.  Hopefully it will get better as the show continues, but I must admit I don't hold out much hope.",2
isekai-cheat-magician,This anime is just another Isekai anime. It follows a very basic iskai plot line. Of course the main characters or OP so the fights aren't going to be that good for a little bit. For me in the first ep it felt that they rushed into the story a bit too fast. I don't feel like this will be a major anime (far from it) but you can watch it and enjoy it if you like isekai animes. Just don't expect anything game changing in this anime.,1
isekai-cheat-magician,"I love Isekais but this show is complete garbage. The characters are boring, the dialogue is just poor, the plot just lacks any consistency.In one episode the hero is told his childhood friend will be raped, does he power up and beat the opponent? Nope he gets his as kicked, then relies on a spirits power to finally win.Later on we find out why they were summoned. Was it to save the world from Demons or Monsters? Nope it was to fight in some King's Civil war. Ok that could work, the Hero decides to tell the King to take a hike? Nope they just agree to get involved in a political dispute. Why side with the King and not his brother? If anything the brother didn't abduct you from your own world.In a good Isekai, the Hero outsmarts the villains in some way, but here he plays right into their hands. This show is just so terrible. I watched the entire thing so I could give it a fair review, but wow that was painful to keep watching.I need to rewatch Overlord now so I can clear this trash from my mind.",1
isekai-cheat-magician,"I have a bad habit of seeing through any anime I start watching. And I've followed through with a lot of bad anime. This anime right here has been the first one to ever break my cycle and made me have to quit off about a third of the way through. Positives: Ecchi, good animation qualityNegatives: Oh my god is there so many  I am not going to make a list. First and foremost -- it is cheesy as hell. Maybe watch EP4 fight to understand what I mean? So many plot holes, and it seems like a kid's show. Honestly this anime caused me to look at isekai genre in another light. I will tread lightly on this overused trail from now on because this anime just proved to take everything from this genre and make it terrible. Want a good isekai? Take any of them from the isekai quartet. Shield hero. Even Arifureta is great this season (albeit terrible CGI, still a great story and characters). The only way I could seriously recommend this anime is as a way to understand what makes a  bad  anime.",1
isekai-cheat-magician,"This has to be the most generic isekai I've ever seen. Nothing really stands out about this show other then it's genericness. But as the review title states, it could be worse. It doesn't do anything wrong. The animation isn't terrible. I just felt like I could have spent my time a lot better. I honestly wish it were worse so at least I could laugh at bad it is. If you really just want to watch an isekai, this does the job fine, just don't expect anything to blow away",2

What I'm trying to say is, you'll get no reaction out of this show. You'll acknowledge that it existed and move on. Being simple isn't so bad. However, there is nothing here to chew on. No comedy, no good romance, no character development, no good action at all, a very basic Isekai setting, and a story that has no excitement or urgency to it. Everything in this anime is so generic. The show doesn't even have a ""so bad that it's good"" vibe going on here. I'm going to stop here because I don't need to be wasting your time reviewing every flaw of this show.

isekai-cheat-magician,"Ultra generic, its like if they took SAO, pulled out everything that was redeeming from it, and plopped this garbage out. I normally will go through the whole series, no matter how bad it is just so that I can give a review of it, but the boring premise wasn't able to hold my attention to the end so I'm dropping it at episode 4. If it gets better, please let me know and I'll do a full review, but otherwise I don't see this being worth my time.Story 0/5: Insert generic main male protagonist and generic main female female protagonist who happens to be his childhood friend. They get sucked into a generic isekai fantasy world with magic and sword fighting and blah blah blah where they both get crazy strong, world altering powers and they need to become adventurers to survive in this world and get back home. Character 0/5: Main character literally looks like what what you get if you googled ""anime male protagonist"". Do it, do it right now. Do it. Do it. Do it. Seriously, do it right now. The main characters have the generic motivations of anyone in an isekai world which is to go back home. Insert obligatory childhood friend, older senpai, elf, fairy and boom you get the characters in this anime. It's like they had a big bag of anime tropes and just picked them randomly. And also obviously there are no other male characters of any importance because that would get in the way of hot anime waifus. Character development consists of ""I need to get stronger so I can protect whats her face and we can go back home"". Obviously the main character has this stupid OP power that he can't really control yet so you bet that whenever he has a remotely difficult fight, some random voice is gonna pop out of nowhere and suddenly he wins.Art/Animation 1/5: Standard animation quality but minus points for any lack of originality. Sound 0/5: Intro and ending songs are very skippable. Fight music is equally bad. I'm using $700 headphones going through $250 dollar tube amplifier and a 100 dollar digital analog converter and even this ridiculous audio set up can't make this pile of garbage sound good. Enjoyment 1/5: If you haven't seen any isekai anime in the last 10 years, maybe watch this cause this will introduce you to everything you need to know about them in the most boring way so anything you watch after this will seem like its the most amazing isekai anime in the world. Overall 1/5: Generic, Boring. It was interesting for the first few episodes. I was expecting it to be like Mondaiji which was also garbage but at least entertaining garbage with bunny girls. The thing that stopped me was episode 4 which drained all of my expectations of it being good. If this turns around after episode 4, please someone let me know and I'll watch it. As of now, it's getting dropped from my queue.",2
isekai-cheat-magician,"bruh, most generic trash I've seen in a while. Everyone is a moron and a stereotype at the same time. No interesting characters, no twist on the isekai formula. A generic isekai and a bad one at that. Episode 4 has a beast that can only be attacked by magic, so obviously the guy with no magic splits from his group of mages and fights it alone. It's actually incredible how horribly written this is. 0/10 why is this an anime",3
isekai-cheat-magician,"It seems you can't cast a random spell in any direction these days without hitting another Isekai anime. To be fair, some of my favorites fall under this genre. But what sets this one apart?Sadly, nothing. The drawing and animation, while not bad, are mediocre. The plot thus far offers absolutely nothing new to see, to the point that some of the tropes have actually been made fun of in other isekai anime. The dialogue and plot are sophomoric at best. It's not terrible, and if you're a big fan of the genre there's no specific reason not to watch it. But there's nothing special about it either.",3
isekai-cheat-magician,"I never write reviews, i've watched a lot of anime and i can honestly say that this one is by far the worst. Don't waste your time. Imagine you're in a classroom, and there's one guy presenting. Then the guy starts getting really nervous. You can see what's coming, you see his regretable outcome. Then the unimaginable happens, it's actually worse than what you thought. He turns pale, then vomits all of his insides and then faints. This show is something like that. 100%. Guaranteed.",1

You say to yourself, ""Gee, this chicken wrap should be pretty healthy, so to celebrate my sense of self-control, I'm going to find an anime to watch while I eat!""You start watching Isekai Cheat Magician. Taking a big bite of your chicken wrap, you notice something: there's a big glob of... something among the salad dressing, and you realize, with relative certainty, that someone spat in your chicken wrap.Disgusted, you realize you're also hungry, so you continue to eat the wrap, feeling mildly nauseous the whole time. You only get half-way through the chicken wrap before you give up, throwing it in the garbage. Incidentally, you also turn off Isekai Cheat Magician, and after associating the show with your spat-on wrap, you never pick it back up again.This whole review was a metaphor. Think about it.",1
isekai-cheat-magician,"Who ever write and directed this needs to just pack up and find a new job. Great name to the start of a good series, only to flop. Can i please get the 7 episodes worth of time back. I feel crunchyroll has lost its touch and started airing bad series. It used to always have 3-4 great series airing at all times, but as of the last 6+ months only 1-2 series i follow. Not worth a subscription at this point. Only thing i watch is black clover and it airs on hulu, i might as well start watching it on there and save myself some money.",1
isekai-cheat-magician,This is depressing. Garbage plot and very average production quality. The music is also bad. I guess I can binge this thing and make everything else a work of virtuosity. More details:1) Copy another isekai anime that is actually decent;2) Remove any unique quality from characters and instead plug in all the cliché tropes imaginable;3) Remove any dialogue that gives any appall to the story;4) Give everybody aids.,1
isekai-cheat-magician,"Summation/TL;DR at the bottom    The premise for the show was about as basic as it could be but I was fine with that, as it is in the Isekai genre, which have the same general presence. Usually, what defines a show or movie of this category is how interesting of a twist or premise they can put on the whole ""transported to another world and we're super strong for some reason"" bit as well as great characters and memorable animation. This show misses all of these marks.   The main characters have barely any personality to them, with the main guy having a simple ""I'm gonna protect and save everyone attitude,"" Rin and Muller (who looks like BotW Zelda's cousin) have practically the same personality with a hint of resolve on Muller's half but bland for the rest of it, and then there's Lemia, who is actually the best out of all of them, but even then, that's not saying much, boasting the usual ""I'm a caring hardass and am very strong"" archetype. The idea that there was evil in the royal family and some overlord wasn't an interesting or new idea, but that's not the issue. The problem is that it was done in such a basic way, with little innovation being done besides ""I planned for everything to happen in the way I expected to happen.""        Now regarding the animation, it's passable, but not worth writing home about. There are some egregious errors and signs of laziness that occur throughout the series, like cutting the camera away so some major action happens off-screen or not animating different frames and just moving the body. The biggest example I can think of is when protagonist boy is fighting the dragon and the dragon's body isn't even animated when talking, just simply moved up and down, including the wings (no flapping), as well as the design of the dragon's claws being gross and kind of disproportionate to look at. My biggest offender for this episode in particular is when Ana got shot with a ball of fire/plasma that cam from the dragon's mouth and when the camera cuts back to the explosion, SHE LOOKS LIKE SHE WAS STABBED IN THE ABDOMEN. NO BURNT CLOTHES, NO BURNT SKIN, NO NOTHING! Just some blood. And when protag gives Ana to Rin, somehow, all the blood on her is just magically gone. Another issue that irked me about this episode was the fact that when the big generals of the enemy army appeared in smoke and stuff, you could see the sky/background shaking so much that the top portion of the screen was black, meaning they shook the background past the limits of the image rather than make more blue sky, placing smoke over it thinking ""ah, it's fine, it's not lazy at all.""   One thing I do respect the show for is making the villains as well as the heroes realize the priority of the situation they're in, like how they stop fighting when they get overwhelmed by enemies targeting them both, showing a sign of mutual respect and logical understanding.To summarize: the Characters are weak and uninspired, the story's a snooze fest, the animation's kind of lazy and inconsistent, and please watch ""That Time I Got Reincarnated As A Slime,"" as it is much, MUCH better than this barrel of trash",3
isekai-cheat-magician,"Let me just start with this isn't even worth one star, that's how bad it is.This show is full of cliches, and not the good ones either. You'd think getting a female protagonist would be good, but Rin really just exists to give the real 'star' of the show a reason to not blow up the world.Every fight they get in is taken seriously by the characters, but only in their heads. We get too much exposition, and too little actual 'fight'. The casual banter makes me want to compare this to a Marvel movie, and that's not saying it's actually good. I swear I almost fell asleep at the final fight.The poster would make you think you'll see a lot of action here, but nope. I'd say about 70% of this show is talking and exposition. Don't get me wrong, SOL is my favorite genre, but this is definitely not that.The fact this got a dub just makes me want to question if whomever made it got forced to do it or they thought the ratings from the people watching it to find out if it would ever improve were actually people enjoying this show.In short, don't watch this, or the dub. I feel bad for everyone who had to work on this (bar the writers).",1
isekai-cheat-magician,"The first episode was eh. But this is the most generic, badly written isekai I have had the misfortune to have assaulted my eyeballs. bland, generic MC's, generic world with zero backstory, awful pacing, not even good fan service. I mean how do you screw up fan service. This is without a doubt a steaming hot, pile of dog dookie, served to you with cold fries. It is like that train crash scene in COD, where it is going on for way too long. I was so upset I paid the premium to leave a bad review on this and one other show.",1
isekai-cheat-magician,"All the one-star reviews of this series are right on. This series is utter garbage, completely uninspired in every way. Started watching it with my husband as each episode was released. For the first week or two I was merely unimpressed. Then I began feeling progressively unsettled that I was wasting my time, eventually to the point of actual anger, heh. My husband liked the show a bit more than I did, but by week 6 we had both had enough, and dropped it.",1
isekai-cheat-magician,"First episode or so were fine, but when this show finally got to some fight scenes, it because very apparent that this was going to be a rough one to get behind. Frankly the only reason I finished it was to do a check list on cliches in the episodes and mark down how many times they decide to reference the show title.The only decent episodes besides maybe the first two was likely when the general showed up, but even they were pushed off to the side quickly.Animation wise, this show is severely lacking in any sort of flow or impact. Despite fighting with his fist (I still don't know why a Summoner uses their damn fist to go DBZ in fights) whenever he hit or got hit, they stood still as if they were a solid pillar, even if they were floating in the air. Then there was also all the times where a large hulking beast slams a fist down on him and he brofist to stop them.Every single time, there was no debris, no clothing fluttering, no great sound effects to add to the impacts, and a slew of other things lacking. This show is made to only fill a time slot with zero effort put into the anime itself, nor building up its own world.",2
isekai-cheat-magician,"Cheat lives up to its name I'll give it that much.  It hopes to deliver an entertaining and profitable product with out doing any of the work necessary by just watering down and copying better efforts.  .It's rare to find a show that manages to not stand out in any way, even bad shows have their good aspects, but Cheat just doesn't.  Everything from the animation, to the characters, to the story, to the pacing, etc etc everything is just bland, average, or worse.  Cheat might have been a three star show, but it just manages to suck all the fun out of the genre, so I took one away.  You can skip this one.",2
isekai-cheat-magician,"Hmm.. How did I come across this particular series... I wonder.. Isekai.. My favorite catagory..Isekai Cheat Magician. It's like.. so bland..? I tried to give this series a chance. I've watched ten episodes so far and I just can't get into it. Why I watched that many, I don't know. Maybe i'm too nice and like to give everything an even chance.But this series.. this series is probably the one and only one where the review section is 100% accurate. Normally when I see a great many negative reviews flooding the review section, I ignore it and watch the series anyway. But it seems I did not heed the warnings of the many who came before me. So to any who read this review, it would behoove you to stay away. I lost five hours. Five. Hours. When i'm on my freaking deathbed filled with regrets slowly fading away wishing I had just a little more time to spend with my family, i'll remember that I could've had five more hours to live if I hadn't watched this series.2/10 (2 because its anime and I obviously enjoy anime. -∞/10 for the series itself)",1
isekai-cheat-magician,"So many overused ideas and tropes in anime. It's not well animated and it has so many plot holes that cannot be overshadowed with anything that resembles a good show. I'm no true anime critic and I tend to just turn off my brain and watch some shows and enjoy what the shows are trying to bring me through but still... I can't bear to watch this show. Even half paying attention and using this show for background noise actually fails due to the annoying desire for it to actually be something worthwhile but knowing that it just fails at that too. One of the worst anime I've seen come out recently and for an isekai anime it is far more disappointing than anything. Such a cheap cash grab at a popular genre and it is utterly disappointing even in that factor. If you're trying to watch a bad show and watch because it can be so bad that it can be laughed at and be one of the rare ""so bad that it is good"", go watch arifueta or ""In another world with my smartphone"". This show is just down right bad.",1
isekai-cheat-magician,"Nice to zone out to and fill time between better animes, but story-wise, bad pacing and entirely predictable. Had high hopes, but each episode just reminds me that ""Hey, these guys are really powerful and can beat anything."" Oh no, new challenge! They seem to be in trouble! Oh they win. Oh no, new challenge! They seem to be in trouble! Oh they win again. Lather, rinse, and repeat. The art and animation is good and voice acting is decent, but there's just so little substance it's hard to be really invested. Kind of like In Another World With My Smartphone. MC(s) are powerful and have awesome knowledge from old world they use to further boost their already ridiculous powers but have no personality other than *insert protagonist behavior here*.",3
isekai-cheat-magician,"This show is pretty awful. If you've watched literally any Isekai before, imagine the blandest, most boring parts of what you've seen before. This show is that.The Characters: Are all bland uninteresting tropes. I know that this is true because six episodes in, I can't remember any of their names, except for one character who is apparently (and hilariously) named ""Hole"". Our main two characters are the girl who has always had the hots for the main dude, and the main dude who is the blandest of the bland. He's your standard lawful good anime protagonist who is always going to bend over backwards trying to be inoffensive. All of the reasons that he does things are your standard altruistic hero reasons. Again, think of any main character from a bad isekai and this guy is that. I think that they may have talked about wanting to get back in the first episode, but since then seem to have forgotten that that was a thing they were doing.The World: I don't know what's going on, but it feels like the answer is a resounding 'nothing'. At this point we don't really know why our two main characters were pulled into the magical fantasy world. They gave us a breakdown of how magic works, and it's all standard, except of course our two heroes have way too much magic *flailing arms over-dramatically*. Even though they are supposed to be stupidly over-powered, no one seems to notice or comment on it after the initial conversation about it, which feels like a problem. Also, the fact that they are stupid strong makes the stakes feel like they've been stripped away, and also makes everything that shows up that is a threat feel like it should just bulldoze over literally everything else, and yet there are still other characters fighting with them on the battlefield. They had some assassins show up, for no reasons, beat them up and didn't kill one of them, and then didn't bother to actually find out why there were assassins. It's hard to imagine that we'll ever get any answers to even the most basic questions, when this show seems to think that distracting its audience from questions with a half-naked sorceress will save it.The Animation: It's not great. The parts that are rendered and animated the best seem to be fanservice shots of the half-naked sorceress. The fights are a lot of magical flashes and things that look like they could be reused later. I haven't noticed them reusing anything yet, but I won't be surprised if I do notice it later.Final Deliberation: This show is kind of like all of the worst parts of Wiseman's Grandchild slammed together with all of the worst parts of How Not To Summon A Demon Lord. There is nothing new here, and the parts that have been recycled were not good the first time around.",1
isekai-cheat-magician,"You know that feeling you get when you're watching something and you start to question your life choices? then you've come to the right anime. It makes you sit there and the whole time you're thinking ""why am watching this? im pretty sure watching gram gram eat a tuna salad while she talks about how grandpa hasn't touched her in years is more interesting than this garbage"" but thanks to this anime being sooo bad i finally had the courage to stop watching anime for a bit and went outside and found myself a girlfriend. So thanks trash anime",1
isekai-cheat-magician,"3-episode review:Unfortunately, Isekai Cheat Magician fails to stand out as more than just Isekai fodder following formula. The anime fails to provide any defining characteristics beyond having 2 isekai'd protagonists instead of the usual one (both of which lack any quirks or memorable personality.) For those following the 3-episode rule, by the time we get there nothing has happened, no hook has been provided and no stakes or attachments to any of the characters have been introduced. Even hardcore Isekai fans will likely find themselves pushing through this anime and if nothing picks up, struggling to remember it's existence in 2 seasons' time.",1
isekai-cheat-magician,"1. Did it seem like the story had a beginning that caught your attention, a middle thatmade you want to continue reading, and an ending that satisfied you? It caught my attention at first, but within the first ten minutes, I became bored. The dialogue between the main two protagonists was lackluster. It failed to establish strength in their friendship. By the middle of the series, it was difficult to differentiate between the female characters based on their similar personalities. After I finished the series I came away not truly gaining anything from the series. Organization Felt like I was a dog being dragged around with the promise of a sausage. Once it became interesting, it stopped..Development Character development was attempted. However, I felt more for the development of a supporting character rather than the main characters. Characters I found the monsters to be more interesting characters than the protagonists and their companions. I was more intrigued by their actions and reasonings rather than the protoganists'. That feeling dissipated very quickly as the show swiftly provided the answers, or provided too much.Style: Nothing out of the ordinary. Production for the purpose of a cash-grab and quick buck.",1
isekai-cheat-magician,"I believe that even the most inexperienced creator can come up with something more imaginative than this. Even if it were a poor effort, I would have given it a higher rating for a hint of slight novelty. This just feels like a side project with all the random elements from different fantasy anime thrown being together to make yet another Isekai. Come on, there are so many wonderful mangas waiting somewhere to get an adaptation into anime easily a million times more deserving than what i just watched. To put it simply, this is nothing more than just a really bad way to waste time.",1
isekai-cheat-magician,"This show takes the usual isekai story line of summoning an individual from our world into a fantasy one and grants him ""cheat"" like overwhelming  powers. Literally a carbon copy of every other isekai story line every shown. Main character doesn't have to earn his powers at all and becomes the most powerful being in the world simply because the plot line deems it so. Poor, predictable writing and forgettable characters coupled with sub-par animation and cliched fan service make this show undesirable in every way. I honestly have nothing good to say about this anime.",2
isekai-cheat-magician,"Not to sound like a broken record but this anime is garbage. The entire premise of this show is that the MC is powerful, but they even failed with doing that. I'll admit that I never got too far into the show as I'd honestly rather go watch some SAO offshoot, but from what I've seen, he's only a bit more powerful than the rest of the people there. If I wanted to watch an anime with an OP MC I'd just go watch Overlord or hell even shield hero has a much more powerful MC IMO so it falls flat on its face just thanks to the title. The most originality I've seen in this show is how the two MCs got into whatever that places name is and I'm honestly quite surprised they just didn't bring out the isekai truck. Other than that, I guess the character models are original but that's something that would usually go without saying. Without even watching all of it, the plot can probably summarized as two people get isekaied, some other chicks join their party, all the chicks get jealous of whoever's closest to the MC, they defeat the big bad person and done. The only reason I'm writing this rant is to try to lower this things rating down so the idiots that made it can see how absolutely no one likes this garbage and stop the production of a new season altogether.TL;DR - go watch overlord instead.",1
isekai-cheat-magician,"The progress is insane. Like the world has progressed maybe a few months and he's like a god to them and the royal's head mage is like ""Hey kid, do whatever you want man!"" They give no meaning to stuff just ""THAT THING!?"" ""A CERTAIN PERSON"", or ""BUT WAIT YOU CAN'T MEAN THAT!?"", then a meaning-less event and he's powered up to the sky even more. Just horrible. Read the other reviews and you get the idea. This is a trash anime and should feel like trash.",2
isekai-cheat-magician,"For those of you who are curious, Conception is the worst isekai anime.  This isn't  that bad, but that's damning it with faint praise. Isekai Cheat Magician had an actual budget to work with, rather than the bag full of aluminum cans that Conception was funded by.  It also wasn't made strictly to be a shitty advertisement for a game, so that's a plus.  And it doesn't sideline the harem of girls to give all the screentime to an annoying raccoon.  Why did I spend the first paragraph of this review of Isekai Cheat Magician talking about Conception instead?  Because at least Conception is so bad that it is somewhat interesting as a cultural artifact. (the anime equivalent of a train wreck)What you are actually getting with Isekai Cheat Magician is the bargin bin of Isekai.  Bland characters, boring plot, and lame battles.  If you need an isekai to spend time on as you ignore your slowly approaching death, and you've seen everything except this and Conception...  then this show is a no brainer.  Otherwise it's just for us isekai purists, who have a defect in our brains that make us watch every isekai that comes out.P.S.Don't watch Conception.  I know you're curious, since I've mentioned it so much in this review.  Don't watch Conception.  I'm only stressing this so much because I know someone will read this and think, ""This Conception show can't be that bad, can it?"" and I take sadistic glee knowing that I'll expose someone to that war crime of an anime.Don't Watch Conception.",2
isekai-cheat-magician,"This show simply put was a standard run of the mill show with nothing special or outstanding about it. It was a as generic as they com isekai. With many other isekai being made with some caveat / unique, for example shield hero where the mc is being abused by the ones who summoned him. Another decent example is the wise man grandchild, though it's not nearly as innovative as shield hero. In the end the show Isekai cheat magician is just very cliche and the story is one used many time over and very predictable. This show had potential if it wasnt so childish in the storytelling and would have been interesting if the mc acually used his powers to uproot nations. But because of the lackluster characters and overall underwhelming story this show just cant be reviewed as good. But it was a good show to turn your brain off to and just kind of let it play while you think about other things. Watch the show if your bored with nothing better to do or need a filler show just to clear your mind from your last show. In the end watch if your a casual anime fan, but those of us who enjoy a deep story with interesting characters with plotlines and sub plotlines this show is trash.",1
isekai-cheat-magician,"I cannot believe that someone put so much effort and made 12 isekai episodes only to excuse the fanservice cleavage exposition. If you like that, this is almost Fairy Tail experience, similarly, plot is not even important anymore. I watched whole 12 episodes, because i wanted to give chance again for sweet, cheerful fantasy anime genre like this. And hopefully i wanted to be proven wrong it is generic, for example i hoped in the later stage it will turn out this is gintama-style parody of isekai genre. But it was not. It is serious in it repetition of tropes and cliches.But the worst thing for this show actually is not the fanservice, not bland characters and neither the plot that is so consistent that you can watch simply last episode and it will suffice or watch whole season in reverse order for the same effect. The actual problem is that no plot milestone, no decision, no action in this whole series feels any weight, no character feels relatable, no villain feels as the one anyone should watch out for. Everything is sadly washed-out to the very end, supposed plot-twists are not even slightest turnout.",1
isekai-cheat-magician,"For a character who's supposed to be OP he gets slapped around alot. Alot of the dialog is pretty bad and boring, and his powers arent all that special. He also carries around a sword the entire show and uses it like once. They drag out most of the episodes to the point where most could actually be covered in 5 minutes. All in all, pretty bad show and would not recommend you watch it unless you like bad anime.",1
isekai-cheat-magician,"Take a shot every time they say ""cheat""You'll be hammered in no time and then the show might be entertaining. I'm still watching it in hopes that the story goes somewhere and occasionally a joke worth a laugh will happen. other than that they lean into every word of the title.Is it an isekai? yesdo they ""cheat"" by just giving the main characters OP powers from the start with little focus on them gaining control over these amazing powers for the sake of moving along a rushed story? yesdo they use magic? yes",1
isekai-cheat-magician,"The biggest failing of this series is how it continually sets up dramatic reveals that don't deliver.  They either reveal something that I was expecting for quite a while, or they reveal something so inconsequential that I feel confused why they conceal it in the first place.The 'cheat' concept is repeated a lot, but it's really just your standard overpowered isekai hero.  It delivers on having cute fantasy girls, and it's never really bad; just somewhat uninteresting.",1
isekai-cheat-magician,"Someone, in the comments of one of the episodes, compared this to a kid's daydream, and I couldn't agree more. Just remember how one of your daydreams played out sitting in class. How shallow the plot is to make the MC look better, and how even the most legendary characters harolds and the strongest, end up depending on the MC. It's just a bunch of terrible writing, it's probably the same as asking a 13 year old to make believe a story, and just writing it all down.The animation is pretty terrible as well. I was honestly convinced it was done by JC until I just looked it up.",1
isekai-cheat-magician,"Honestly, not sure if this anime is getting bot review.I am a fun of the Isekai genre but I understand that Isekai's are bad for the most part I am just partial to them (they're fun). This show is so far below the average I have seen the comments on the show ""I love the animation of this show"" but it looks like it was made by sliding a PNG over a background. The story is pretty dry too, there is nothing really special about the main character, no planning, no idea what he's going to do, very flat character.I see how this show has a decent rating but honestly, this show is probably the worst isekai I've seen.",1
isekai-cheat-magician,"Going into Isekai cheat magician, i didnt expect much, just fun isekai story with plenty of op-ness. Maybe even isekai and magic version of one punch man if things were great... After all, the title does suggest something along those lines.Instead this has turned out to be show where quality drops considerably with each episode (maybe only exception is up until ep 3- everything after that is downhill). And now, after episode 10, i find myself at point where i will drop it. At time of writing, episode 11 is out and i just dont feel like watching it. Honestly it reminds me of masters of ragnarok, but that show, as bad as it was, at least had few elements that were ok... this... not reallyIts artwork is probably the best thing it has going for it as character designs and artwork is actually quite decent, but is dragged down by animation. Sound and voice acting is ok mostly as voice actors (who with all honesty dont seem to be best, at least not yet- but i do wish them more power moving onward) give their best to breathe life into proceedingly worse story and lines, but even they cant do miracles. There are several scenes that are supposed to be emotional, but fall flat on their faces.Characters start off interesting enough- you can see there is potential for them, however they move in direction that makes them increasingly one dimensional and just.. boring. The main character is pretty much only one who they try to give some depth to, but even that fails horribly as he is constantly brooding more than batman, makes stupid decisions even for a little kid, let alone teenager. Interestingly enough it seems like main pairs magic teacher has most depth despite her short screentime..And story.. oh geesh the story. It is all over the place. You could probably make up better story as you go along that would be more cohesive.For clarification- i dont mind bad stories as long as anime manages to keep me entertained, but there has to be something other than just pretty artwork to sustain it. This one.. has nothing. It takes something horrendously special for me to give something a low rating, but as much as i hate to say it, this is in.",2
isekai-cheat-magician,"Where do I start.  Bad character development.  Subpar animation.  Low budget sound.  Horrible writing.  Some episodes were more cringe-worthy than others, but there weren't enough decent episodes to redeem this series.  The anime is based on a light novel series that was not popular enough to get localized outside of Japan, which speaks volumes.  A light novel series that is far superior to this would be 異世界魔法は遅れてる! (The Magic in this Other World is Too Far Behind!)  Similar concept (the ""cheat"" aspect), but with an intelligent MC and cast of characters that are far livelier, entertaining and endearing.",1
isekai-cheat-magician,"As many other reviews have mentioned, this anime brings nothing new to the table. It doesn't even take itself with a grain of salt like certain alternatives (that contain a slime *cough*). The primary protagonist is overpowered in power level alone, yet is frustratingly incompetent at avoiding injury (even by episode 10) or remembering his core character motivations (especially by episode 10). The secondary clear-set-love-interest is overly competent but doesn't have particularly clear character motivations besides sticking with the primary protagonist/self-insert. The world building is present, but not particularly interesting or bringing anything new to the table (basically all concepts have been explored prior). The relative quality of the animation, and the lack of outright filler-material is the only saving grace.",1
isekai-cheat-magician,"All but two episodes in this anime feel very slow. This is because there is no good comedy, amazing animation or strong character development that happens in any single episode. As for amazing large scale fight scenes (Which are one of the only reasons to watch a show with a hideously OP protagonist) simply do not exist in this show. The show is even not good at developing romance (which might make it somewhat more interesting). This show is simply a strictly worse version of the wise man's grandchild a show that I thought was pretty boring, but was at least passed faster and had more interesting things going on during down time. 2/5.",2
isekai-cheat-magician,"Like most other people on here, I thought it started off alright, because it was carbon copying every isekai ever. It showed some promise, but had a few missteps that could be forgiven. After episode 2, however it seems to go out of it's way to try to be boring and confusing at the same time. Scenes jump around, characters change motivations at the drop of a hat. Not worth watching. It's the Star Wars Sequal Trilogy of Anime. Xeroxed start with a terrible center, and I'm not even watching the end.",2
isekai-cheat-magician,"Bruh. This anime is so clichéd its not even funny. I wasn't gonna write a review or give it a rating but it was just so bad I feel like I have no choice.Art Quality: 7/10. Including both the drawing and music, these are probably the 'best' aspects of the anime. Not much to tear into here. Plot: 3/10. It started out decent but got worse as we progressed. Lack of action is a real killer, why even make a magic anime when the protagonist barely uses it? Half the time he seems confused at the fact that he actually has magic. You find out later on that the Mc is summoned whilst meeting certain criteria like ""learning magic"" but where? He only uses body enhancement and  summons the spirit whom controls the weakest of all elements, wind. But his female companion gets to wield multiple elemental magics.. Bruh what. If that wasn't bad enough, you really start tearing your hair out when you find out the Mc is a typical sissy who uses no forethought whatsoever. The whole plot is finally revealed and centered around the mc's trying to stop a sibling quarrel. To sum it all up, two people get their lives ripped away from them to stop two brothers from fighting over a country because their political views are different. Sounds fair right?Character development: 4/10 again, Mc is supposed to have the ability to learn magic, only does 2 things. And acts like a 10 yr old when he is in high school. Love how easily they get over situations. Ana dies, next episode she's forgotten, k cool.Mc's leave a decent life for this magic war filled one, no problem, must've not had many friends. In the end, just another washed up clichéd isekai anime",1
isekai-cheat-magician,"This is post ep. 7. (and before you say ""why watch so much of it if it's bad"" I have the urge to finish the shows I start especially when I feel there is potential, which I feel there is some here. I haven't read the manga but if it's handled differently then the studio screwed it horribly)What I mean by the title of my review is that the show has these scenes that try and be high-stakes and emotional, but it just fails completely because there is no good character buildup and world building done as a prerequisite. They just throw as many cliches as they can without any real purpose, and most of them contradict themselves. Like the elf swordsman being one of the strongest adventurers, but barely being able to hold her own most of the time and not really displaying any wowing techniques. Like she can cleave monsters in half and shoot fire, whoop-dee-doo. I feel like that alone doesn't make you one of the best adventurers in your city.The series is just failing to create any feeling other than the fact that everyone is useless when the going gets tough except Taichi. Which should not be the case considering the people around him are supposed to be some of the strongest in the area. The characters make me feel like I'm stuck in the Sahara desert with how dry they are. Everyone is pretty much useless regardless of how strong they are, except Taichi. And it's all for the sake of showing how strong Taichi is, I guess?Take Overlord for example, extremely overpowered main character, but everyone else in the series isn't as useless as throwing a potato at the enemy. Overlord also actually does some world building, hell even Wise Man's Grandchild did at least a decent job worldbuilding and with character development so that the series wasn't as bad as this one.This series is like when you answer all ""unsatisfactory"" for the surveys that ask how you felt about their product. I will say the voice acting is pretty nice, but the way everything is used in this show just feels wrong and it results in a terrible implementation of the story.And if you somehow read all the way to the end, all I'm saying is, it's not really worth watching this one. Go watch Death March to a Parallel world Rhapsody if you want to watch a show where it feels like only the main character can do something and it still be nice to watch.",1
isekai-cheat-magician,"It isn't bad, because the bar for bad animes is truly low (cough* wolfs reign). This anime is almost a work of art in that it is the most dry, straightforward, mechanically produced encapsulation of the issekai genre. There is absolutely nothing new or special that separates this anime from its peers. It is somewhat entertaining to watch as each episode competes with the previous to be an even greater generic advancement on the overall plot line.",1
isekai-cheat-magician,"I feel as it is unfair for cruncyroll to demand original work out of its paying members when they don't out of these shows we pay (or watch commercials they're paid for) to watch. I have never in my life seen such a blatant rip off of various ideas from other franchises done so poorly and effortlessly. its the equivalent of taking spam mail, blending it together with bleach and hot sauce, then injecting said concoction into your eyes only to commit harakiri whilst touching yourself with your own entrails to the meowmix song every single episode.",1
isekai-cheat-magician,"Like many other shows this one has a lot of great potential but it seems to have a common problem with every episode:  During each episode questions are raised about what's going on and each additional episode isn't answering those questions but are still adding more.  In fact, there are a lot of things about the characters that are hinted at and then the subject never seems to come up again.There is a lot suggesting that there is a lot going on behind the scenes that the viewer doesn't know about but it makes me want to bang my head against that wall because it never gives me any adequate information about what I really want to know.If you just want a show to watch with a lot of action and mysteries, which never seem to get solved, then this would be a good show to watch but if want a show that cares about keeping a good flow and keeps you informed about what everyone is thinking and/or doing, you won't like this one.",1
isekai-cheat-magician,"I've watched a lot of other world anime. And when I say a lot, I mean I go out of my way to find new ones. No exaggeration, this one is at the bottom of my list. (I've currently watched up to episode 6.) The start of the story seemed ok, there were smaller pieces here and there that seemed potentially interesting...? The foreshadowing in this show kind of sucks/doesn't add suspense to the episodes at all. It's like, the show is trying too hard to look like it's balanced between cool/serious/casual just to end up being the worst kind of cliche for an other world anime. It's not even cliche in a funny way, it's just.... straight up cliche. Nothing particularly good stands out about this show, it's way too generic.",1
isekai-cheat-magician,"This is probably the worst Isekai out there. I wanted to see where this was going but this show does not leave me wanting more.  Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideLike in ep 6. She used her magic to dig a whole, fill it with water, then drop hot liquid metal to create steam to take out most of the enemy... Id honestly think that the liquid metal would have sufficed. Oh and what did that steam do, not much cause the next scene still showed a shit ton on the enemy.  I could go on but its pretty much a waste of time, just like the show.",1
akame-ga-kill,"The anime starts off great, and follows the manga up to a certain point. Its well animated and I enjoyed watching what I read in the manga come to life. However, towards the end it just skips an entire section of the manga (probably cuz it was ""to violient"" and ""depressing"") and it just gets horrible. The story doesn't hold up to what the manga is going for (which is a hundred times better). The writing and story plot is just boring and predictable to no end after this and just a train wreck of ""lets kill everyone cuz it's shocking!!"" I wanted more from this anime and I just feel like it's another Hellsing, or Full Metal Alchemist wait for its Ultimate version or Brotherhood......We can only hope we get it, so Akame ga Kill can be enjoyed the way it was meant to be.The manga story finally wrapped up and it was sooooo amazing in comparison to the way they ended this anime. If you loved this anime you really must read the manga, it's  ending is well done!",4.5
akame-ga-kill,"Towards the end, it just feels rushed an sloppy. Akame ga Kill is a good example of how not to do an adaption. I have no problem if the anime deviates from the manga, as long as its done in a way that feels natural to the series. Akame does not though. I can't give specific examples, as that would give away the story, but I do feel as if the last few episodes just felt rushed as all hell. All Akame has going for it is that it no character has plot armor, but the manga is able to handle this much better than the anime. I very rarely diss adaptions as I understand that things will change, but Akame just disappointed me very much.",3
akame-ga-kill,"I've never seen anything quite like this anime. One minute it'll make you laugh so hard that you're suffocating to death on the ground, and the next it's going to make you shed tears all over your floor.The story follows a completely average MC (by that, I mean he isn't OP, but he isn't weak either). This gives plenty of room for him to grow in strength and character, and so far, his growth has been quite interesting. I mean seriously, farm boy to assassin? The strongest aspect of this show, IMHO, is the characters. All of them are extremely interesting, and you want to know more about them and who they are. Not one of the characters in this show feels unimportant (even the blank and nameless people in the backround). They all feel alive with unique personalities, making the Akame ga Kill! world seem to be in tune with ours. You can connect with these people and understand them (for the most part).As of right now, I have no real complaints with this anime. I can't find anything worth noting. However, the blood and gore might be too much for certain people. If you are squeamish, don't watch this, because this show has some of the bloodiest action I've seen (but it is nowhere near the level of say, Elfen Lied or Gantz).",3
akame-ga-kill,"The first couple of episodes are filled with cliches and extremely cheesy scenes. The story felt like it was rushed and was written by a middle schooler. The audience is pretty much told almost all of the main characters' past through a very somewhat predictable, corny way. The main plot of revenge is very run of the mill. The only thing that kept me watching and entertained was its animation and its fighting scenes. Some may disagree with me, but personally, the fighting scenes remind me of Samurai Champloo's with added blood, violence, and girls. My feelings toward the storyline, however, completely changed after episode 6. It really felt like the writer(s) finally realizes what he is capable of and started applying himself. Not only do the animations and the storyline came together, the soundtrack of this anime is very fitting. When I first watched it, it just felt like they were trying too hard unique but as you go on, you'll eventually get your ears used to it and probably wouldn't be able to think of soundtrack that would fit the anime better. I would give this show a 5/5 but there are still some in it that make me cringe really hard, so a 4.5/5 (crunchyroll won't let me give half of a star) seems really fair. If you've seen enough anime, you'll probably be able to take the cringeworthy moments head-on and if you just started watching, and think it's boring, just wait it out and you'll soon change your mind. Maybe. That's what happened to me anyway.",2
akame-ga-kill,"I believe this anime would have good potential, if the story wasn't so hasted, No character development and shallow motivations for a plot that could have been better exploited. Everyone gets killed before we have the time to grow on the characters, so by the time they die, it really means nothing. Also, the title refers to one of the main characters, but only on the title. Akame has near zero importance to the plot, and her screen time is far less than Tatsumi.By the way, there are funny moments, most of them based on girls' sexuality exploitation. Still funny, but it comes a time when I grew tired of it.Something else that I grew tired of is the time spent by Mine to explain 1000 times, and in different occasions, the not-so-great mechanism of how her weapon works. It is both not that difficult or impressive, so please stop losing precious time in life-or-death situations to explain to your enemy how your power works: IT'S A GUN, for god's sake!What a shame.",4
akame-ga-kill,"I have been a big fan of the manga for quite some time, I remember when it was just a dream for Akame ga Kiru to become an anime and guess what our dreams have come true. First of all the plot, is really good and follows the manga well. The plot is intense and sad but still has comedy relief that fits (I have loads to say bout the plot but I'm just gonna cut it short to that). Now the characters so far really live up to my high standard imagination of them, they portray them quite well and so far I can really feel them even if it's so early in the series. Lastly the graphics/animation it's self, is quite smoothe and fits the anime and is good and showing wat needs to be seen. Anyways I really love it and can't wait till they get to the really intense parts of Akame ga kiru XD",4
akame-ga-kill,"Written after watching 3 eps.The first three episodes have had a nice balance between the necessary plot, character development, action, and comedy to set up the rest of the show and action to keep it interesting.Plot: 4/5The plot is decent. It's easy to understand so it can move along at a decent pace and still allow for time to be spent on character development, fight scenes, and some comedy.Summary:MC leaves for the imperial capitol with 2 pals to earn money for his starving village. Along the way the get separated, and upon arriving the MC is taken in by a noble family. During the night a group of assassins kill the family and in the midst of the choas, the MC discovers that the nobles had tortured and killed his friends in a gruesome and painful manner. MC then taken in by the assassins and begins training to become a full member of the guild or whatever. It's kind of like a justice league of assassins whose main goal is to rid the empire of corruption by killing naughty rich people.One problem so far is that the whole reason he comes to the capitol in the first place was to save his village. But beyond being a device to bring him to the capitol, the situation is ignored. I'm hoping to see this part of the story line resolved or addressed by the end of the series cause he kinda left his whole family there and it would be really shitty to let them starve. My other issue has to due with his training. It looks like he's going to spent an episode ""training"" under each member. While it's a very good device for introducing the different characters more intimately to the viewer, it's hard to tell how much training he's actually doing. Although he does seem to pick up a few applicable skills along the way, it's mainly from observation than any real training. Still better than line barrel where the don't bother training the mc at all and then send him on multiple missions to save the world. no wonder he gets his ass handed to him in every ep, like wtf. This MC comes pre trained and is already pretty skilled so that's a bonus.Characters: 4.5/5 I really like the characters for this show. They all seem to have distinct personalities and some depth. Except for the girl in black with the red eyes and the sword. She's got the whole quiet, cute, girl-with-traumatic-past-who-kills-things vibe. but its only episode 3 so there's time for her to improve so we'll see. Other than her, all the characters have unique and interesting designs that keep me waiting to see them all together.The MC's motivation for becoming part of the assassin group makes you sympathize with him very much. His motivation has been kept relevant, however, unlike other shows they do not overplay this to the point where he becomes a whiny bitch. It's very refreshing. Another thing I like about the MC: he can handle himself and demonstrates inner strength while still maintaining a personality. Most strong MC's have some complex that makes them serious and solemn cause they have to become stronger to save the world and NO FUN ALLOWED. Or they're some cocky bastard who has anger problems but turns into a bitch when sh!t goes down. Not this dude! This MC leans more towards the cocky bastard side but is very well rounded making seem more human.My one concern with him is that he's too overpowered. Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideIt's a little ridiculous that some village hooligan goes out and defeats some crazy strong general, and then next a martial arts master with more years of experience than the kids been alive for. They specifically built up that guys skills to and he gets killed so easily? Like damn, what village did you come from? Detroit with swords?The other characters in the group are all unique and have some sort of backstory that's given to them. Sometimes the development is done very tactfully, but as with the 3rd episode, it is done by means of flashback with character narration which is lame and unoriginal but it was kept short so i don't mind.Art/Animation: 5/5Me gusta. it's fluid. it's pretty. I prefer more flashy art, like what you'd see in ""No Game No Life"". So far my lust for dramatic scenes with intricate detail and lighting has been satisfied. I really like how the scenes in the city retain a feeling of life and movement, instead of being empty or filled with still silhouettes. There are also scenes that really showcase the artists' talents. For example, at the end of the 3rd ep the have to rendezvous at a certain location after a mission. It just so happens that its under blossoming cherry tree and it makes for some pretty animations with the petals and bright contrasting colors.The fight scenes are great. Hoping to see more elaborate ones, but I'm sure we'll get to see some of those later.Voice Acting: 5/5They speak, I listen. no complaints here.Overall: 5/5I really enjoy the balance this show has between plot, characters, action, and comedy. I have some minor issues with the plot, but hopefully they can be addressed in the coming episodes. Even with that, I still found each episode enjoyable. I'm looking forward to next weeks episode with lots of anticipation. If you're looking for something fun to watch that combines a dark plot and lighthearted gags, then tune in, you won't be disappointed. Even if that's not what you're looking for, tune in, you won't be disappointed.",1
akame-ga-kill,"Just like my title, now I understand what all the  intense hype  was about!Akame takes you down the road of basic education for survival during the first episode, and tells you not to trust every pretty face you see out there. The main character is likable and the action scenes are really well done. I enjoy the premise of the anime thus far and, despite some watcher's dissatisfaction at the fact that this is similar to most shounen out there, this one is really likable, at least to me. From the first frame, it's hardcore action, and it even ends in action! But Akame is more than just punches, it has rather nice comedy added to it. I admit that sometimes the comedy is misused and confuses my feelings towards a certain action (one moment I could be covering my mouth in terror and the next I'm just cracking up). The other characters, including the assassins, have their personalities brought out with that really good voice acting this anime has. Kudos to the voice actors! The soundtrack is also awesome.  I recommend you watch this one! Now I understand what all the hype was about, lol.",5
akame-ga-kill,"I binged through this anime in 2 days. The only disappointing part about this anime is that it had to end. The adaptation, the visuals, the music, the story!! It all fit together so well. If you haven’t seen this anime yet, please for the love of (whomever you believe in) watch this already!!! I’m off to read the manga as well as the spinoff and the prequel to get my fix. If you’re like me, you’ll fall in love with almost every character including the “villains (or heroes depending how you see it). Be prepared to experience happiness, excitement, sadness, joy, anger and anxiety in this rollercoaster of a show. Soooo good!! Enjoy!",5
akame-ga-kill,"People are saying that the show starts off good and then gets bad, but I disagree. The first episode was not very good at all. Outside from that one music number, but I can listen to Le Chant De Roma online whenever, so that isn't a good reason for me to watch the show.It starts off with a cold opening that explains how corrupt the Capital city is with a montage of torture and execution. But then after the opening the anime plays itself as if it were a light hearted shounen adventure series. But we already had it explained to us that the Capital is corrupt and that this world is a dark place. So anyone with a functioning attention span already knew it was going to have a dark ""twist"" at the end of the episode. Had they skipped the cold opening, the episode would have been better in my opinion. It feels like a waste of time to build up towards something when there is no payoff, as it was obvious what the episode was going to build up to something dark and edgy.The series also has an issue with trying too hard to be dark and edgy, but also inserts a lot of out of place ""gags"" in that I didn't find funny, but also took me out of the moment because it contrasted so much with the dark tone of the rest of the scene. The dark tones are also handled poorly, as the villains are ridiculous caricatures of bad people, being mustache twirling jerks with no humanity who may as well eat babies for breakfast and kick puppies for all the subtly they possess. Its not a believable setting and feels like what a 13 year old kid would think ""dark"" is, rather than something that is actually mature.The dialogue was also full of unnatural and awkwardly inserted exposition. Why did the rich guy tell our Protagonist about the 3 races if he probably already knew this? Why did the guard decide to tell the protagonist about the child prince and corrupt prime minister if speaking such words were considered treason and thus dangerous? Was it worth risking his head for some stranger he hardly knows?  Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideThe end of the episode also conveniently has a certain character show up just to provide exposition to give the protagonist their reasons to join the Assassins, then is not in the show again. It feels very contrived to have such a convenient coincidence drive the show. If the stars didn't align so conveniently for our protagonist and that didn't happen, the rest of the show wouldn't exist.A good writing will write a story in such a way that the outcome of events are not entirely up to having luck or coincidences drive the plot forward.",4.5
akame-ga-kill,"I really liked this series, especially at first!  From what I am reading from other peoples' reviews, there is a chunk of the manga that is missing from the anime.  Even if you haven't seen this already, you probably know that   Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hidemost everyone, except akame & najenda (NR), and Wave & Angel dude (jagers) die  I felt like, although the anime was pretty solid as a whole, (especially the animation and drops into the characters) the plot suffered from decline in the relevance in the deaths.  I don't know about you, but I felt like the deaths in the second half of the show started to lose importance,  Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hidewith exception to tatsumi's and especially lione's death this made the anime feel like it was just killing off the characters to give a ""shock"" factor.  The more characters died, the less i carried about them when they died. I feel like the first two deaths in night raid had a real reason and served a purpose to the plot:  Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hidecheele's solidified the hatred between the police/government for the viewer and Bulat's granted tatsumi his armor and gave him a fighting spirit But the deaths of characters later in the series seemed redundant and rushed,  Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideespecially lione's, that seemed uncalled for and cruel, like she didn't need to have died, she could have gotten help.  Mine's also, hers felt a little bit more justified but still drove the plot in a way that made the deaths seem unimportant Throughout the anime, i felt like the amount of character development gradually decreased to a point where there was maybe a little flash back and then they were killed off.  I also have to say that the importance of the deaths somewhat parallels Tatsumi's emotions (super to near zip at the end, just another sacrifice).  Overall I ended up liking the anime, despite the flaws in charter deaths, but i would not recommend this anime to many people.-Delaney",4.5
akame-ga-kill,"I don't usually write reviews no matter how much I like the anime (vise versa) but now since I just finished watching the last episode of this very emotional anime series I'll give you my thoughts on it. I read only a little manga and I haven't read this one so I can't give you my opinion on how it was adapted but only the perspective of an anime viewer and I got to say... This anime in particular took a lot of people on a feels trip... I'm not the biggest tragedy fan when it comes to entertainment but this one was really good. Since ancient Greek times when they invented theatrics tragedy has always been the biggest hit and this anime although had a lot of happy moments, it also hit the mark on tragic moments.I definitely suggest that anyone give this a try that can handle violence in anime to find  out what I'm talking about.",5
akame-ga-kill,"I'll start off by saying that I was among the apparent few that didn't read the manga before starting the show.With that stated, this show was delightfully animated with vibrant colors and fluid movements, the action sequences seemed to melt off the screen like butter....bloody....bloody.....butter. The show doesn't stop there, the animation is accompanied by fantastic voice acting and spot on musical scores. All these positive notes should go hand in hand with an outstanding script shouldn't it? Well to answer my own question ""Yes, for the most part"". The story is truly captivating through the first 12 episodes or so, twist and turns are aplenty. In fact I applaud this show for going in directions that other shows haven't. However as the final act begins and the show nears its climax the dreaded flaws appear, at least for me. You can feel how rushed the show is to have everything rapped up in a nice digestible ending. The ending just didn't have as much of a powerful impact on me as I initially expected, it kind of felt like ""All this bloodshed, all this carnaaaaaaaand its over"" Beyond the shows conclusion, it is definitely worth a peep. Hope I was somewhat helpful",5
akame-ga-kill,"The first 18 episodes of Akame ga Kill! were amazing.  They were doing a wonderful job of following the manga.  The music, voice acting, and animation were all fantastic.  Once the story changed around episode 19, the overall quality seemed to drop as well.  Music cuts were being reused, animation seemed to become shoddier, and the story was ridiculously rushed.Aside from the anime and manga not being canon, it was watchable.  The split really hurt the anime though, resulting in deaths that were highly anti-climactic and foreseeable.  The main reason that Akame ga Kill is so tragic is that you didn't expect the deaths of the characters.  You had no idea who was going to die next.  Once the pace sped up and the manga/anime became non-canon, it lost that.If you like watching action anime, you will probably enjoy Akame ga Kill!, but if you read the manga, it will be nothing but a big pile of disappointment after episode 18.  Viewer beware.",5
akame-ga-kill,"Do you remember when everybody was ranting on about how plot armor doesn't exist in Attack On Titan because some people were dying (It's not a spoiler, you should have watched it by now)? If you were having some emotional distress during those dim times, your gonna have a bad time with Akame Ga Kill.The show overall is very enjoyable. They can successfully shift from a lighthearted and funny environment with two heroins shoving their bikini clad bodies into our MC's face, straight into an edgy and gritty scene without skipping a beat. It almost seems like there are two different shows happening at once, with the feel being that much different.While i did enjoy them greatly, the characters were the worst part of this show. The bad people were sometimes almost too evil and sadistic to seem realistic (and don't give me the ""It's an anime its not realistic to begin with"" argument). Some of them are believable and do a good job at making you hate them just enough to not like them, but not enough to seem just dumb. Originally i thought the show was going to go down the road of showing the good side of the bad guys to make this almost like a moral dilemma, but it didn't really do that until halfway through the series, with the Jaegers (And even then its only a few people). Night raid is somewhat what you would expect. All the assassins are deadly killers with a fun and happy side. Some of them have tragic back stories that add to the story, and some are just simple people fighting for the cause they believe in. While i said the characters were the worst, they were still very good.I personally found the premise of the show to be very interesting. There are weapons called ""Teigu"" (translated to imperial arms) that each have a unique ability and form, ranging from a full suit of armor to a makeup box. A lot of attention and detail goes into these weapons, and the characters who use them are the ones to watch out for.Now to the reason you all have heard of this show, the death count. SPOILERS(kinda?) I did the math and less than 10% of the notable characters, ones that lasted more than a few episodes and were important to the plot in some way, are left. If you watched both openings and took a shot every time somebody who died shows up, you'd be dead. But unlike Attack on Titan, when a character dies in Akame Ga Kill, YOU WILL FEEL IT. When a comment on a video has 1600 up-votes on the top comment, you know two things. Somebodies very likely Dying, and they're going out with a damn bang. Overall: 9.5 out of 10 with some some cringe worthy moments towards the end. Definitely worth a watch, and DEFINITELY worth a read if you like manga.",5
akame-ga-kill,"This anime is, in simple terms, fantastic. I have been watching since week 1, and have enjoyed this show unconditionally. The characters are all quirky and have lots of depth. However, if you get really attached to fictional characters, this may not be the show for you. Not saying who, but there are a LOT of character deaths in this anime. Just a warning for you. I have a friend who literally stopped watching because of the death of his favorite character. The story has tons of detail put into it, and now that the last episode has aired, you can just binge the whole thing!!!! I highly recommend this anime to anyone looking for an amazing action series with lots of blood and violence, but with the occasional sprinkle of comedy. Akame ga Kill gets my 5 stars.",5
akame-ga-kill,"Just finished up this show like a couple minutes ago so all i have to say is It's good but not great. Many people will say it was rushed, (which it was, specifically the last couple of episodes) and that it deviates from the manga (Which it did). However, just give it a shot because it is an enjoyable experience nonetheless. I enjoyed it personally but because it was rushed i couldn't give it five stars. But it did enough to keep me coming back every week to see what happens. So just give it a try and if you don't like it then you can drop it, hate on it, it doesn't really matter, the story is over now. It's not like you can do anything about it but post your opinions on it. It has a special place in my heart now.",5
akame-ga-kill,"I added this to my queue but didn't watch it till the second season due to other shows that were playing at the time.  It's a good thing I did, when I enjoy anime it's great to not have to wait till the next week to watch a new episode and that's what happened with Akame ga Kill; I had a small marathon.I only read manga for anime that I really enjoy, I plan on starting the manga after next weeks episode to see what the differences are in the story.If you enough humor, great action, music and story you'll definitely enjoy thisINCURSIO!",1
akame-ga-kill,"The moment I watched the first episode, I knew everything is going down. That being said, this anime is simply great. Now let's summarize this quite bit. In all, the anime delivers what other anime can't do. Simply, it delivers reality and undo carebear moment, it's truly releaving to watch an anime that isn't frightened to kill a few -- or shall we say half? -- of its characters. Moreover, the plot itself is a bit linear but the real question in regards to this: Which group will meet the retribution demise in the end? That question alone hovers over every episode and it's honestly amazing how they set it up. They don't favor one side and another -- and as an added note, one death saddened me to a point where I almost teared up. Finally the setting itself, the fantasy of a tyrannical lands full of Game of Throne's like drama is beautiful. The ending theme and its artwork reminds me of games I used to play, japanese rpg to be more precise. Now shall we get on to the main beef ratings?Animation: 8 Although some animations are still rigid like those scenes in which they just hover over a picture, the fighting scenes give enough beef and it's also supported by a perfect unison of the manga-like scenes and animation. OST: 9It has that familiar feeling whenever they showcases its few but unique OSTs especially during battle and on-town. Characters: 9I like it how they go over each character leaving no character in shadows, recently they showcased Lubba's story and it cleared it up. Oh and note the multiple deaths but at the very least they do show their scenes beforehands. However, some characters are simply bland and a copy of tsundere and whatnots, regardless they don't hesitate to do whatever their ideology wishes them to. Excitement: 10Every episode always has an action scenes and every time, it gives me -- and hopefully the viewers -- that moment in my PC chair: heart beating fast, unable to predict the next outcome, fear of death for a character; relieve or sadness over one. Simply great! Enjoyment: 10It's been awhile since an action anime has kept me in my seat rather than a boring expression.   Stellar **  Edits will follow as the show continues on, so don't get angered too much if you don't find this review to your liking.",5
akame-ga-kill,"Is killing innocent people using trumped up charges the right thing to do for the greater good of a nation? Is doing your job even when you know what you do is morally reprehensible okay so long as you can feed your family? Can the murder of perceived evil people be justified? They say when 2 Imperial arms users meet in battle one of them will die.Each character is ruled by their own resolve, quirks and ethics. All of them are likable up to a point this extends to the ""bad guys"", the Empire Jaegers [Except for the crazy girl with the dog nobody likes her] Romance, comedy and drama are woven together seamlessly in this extreme fantasy setting. Dark themes, adult situations and graphic violence in these the show excels. No one is safe. Give the first couple of episodes a watch if you like action or suspense like Hunter X Hunter or Attack on Titan. You will not be disappointed.",4
akame-ga-kill,"Akame ga Kill isn't just a simple anime to me anymore it's a weekly love affair. There is nothing out right now for a mature audience that will do what this anime does. It is that simple I have cried and I have laughed. I spent a whole saying I wasn't going to watch it after seeing my favorite character die, to only give up and watch it again next week. This anime just does everything so well, from the narrative balance to the art style....For it is the perfect anime for me.",5
akame-ga-kill,"Wow, I haven't been this into an anime in a while. I finally decided to give this show a shot a few nights ago and ended up watching up to episode 14 in one sitting. I believe the last time that happened it was with Kill la Kill... I'm completely engrossed. Let's get one thing straight beforehand- I was really thrown off during the first episode; the way that the writers transition from grim, dark, and serious to comedic and lighthearted was and is much too abrupt. I feel as though it kills the ""immersion"" and makes me regret caring about the serious moment that just happened. However, as the series progresses I either found myself less bothered by that, or those moments just weren't as jarring as the first time.Aside from those poor transitions this anime tends to hit it out of the park... So far I'm really enjoying the character development (especially Akame) and the overall pace of the series. I unfortunately haven't read the manga so I'm not sure how faithful the show is, but the story has me very interested.  Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideOne thing I'm looking forward to is finding out if the Minister uses an Imperial Arms and what that might be, and the whole thing with Tatsumi and Esdeath is hilarious (and kinda reminds me of Bolin from Season 2 of Legend of Korra) The fight scenes are thoughtful and hard-hitting (though they could be a bit more gory) and so far the powers/techniques are nothing ground-breaking but insanely enjoyable. Animations are beautiful, character models unique, voice acting fits each character like a glove, and the protagonist is really likeable. Akame ga Kill! caught my attention with the action and kept my attention with the story and characters. I look forward to seeing out the rest of the series.",4.5
akame-ga-kill,"I began to watch this anime with no great hopes, but now I find it really awesome. The main story is not really different from any other you have watched so far, but it is the conflict of the moral and ethics that makes it so cool. Is killing a justified mean to achieve justice? Is there any legitimacy in revenge? Those are some of the questions in my head I can't give an answer right now. The characters are really cool and funny, Akame is gorgeous, you have some fanservice shots, and alot of cruel and sadistic violence, What else can you ask for? This really is 100% recommended!",4.5
akame-ga-kill,"This shounen action-comedy's humor is puerile. The plot is telegraphed. The characters are flat (and driven by out-of-nowhere expositional declarations as much as previously apparent traits). Occurances happen because the plot requires them to, at least as often as they are character-driven. The hero's trajectory is a threadbare cliche. But I'm still watching. This is partly because its predictability is comfortable. It doesn't feel insincere, overly condescending, or wrote.Dealing with the familar can be nice, but I mostly watch the show for its uncomfortable moments:  brief but regular juxtapositions of troubling, gruesome, and often flippant sadism against relatively childish and optimistic slapstick comedy or warriors-of-honor-fighting-generic-evil battles.The idea of contrasting and intermixing the sort of blood and guts (and cynicism) of Berserk, Blade of the Immortal, or Fist of the North Star with and against the heady (or cloying) youthfulness of something like Naruto or DBZ is fascinating. Some will find these spots jarring, but they are what keep me coming back.Recommended to guys who think they have outgrown shounen anime, and to those who think they should.",4
akame-ga-kill,"Akame ga Kill! does what every action anime should; blood, death (even of important characters), and actual combat scenes often with complicated swordplay.These may seem like obvious things, but they're often neglected in animes like Inuyasha, which has none of the aspects listed. Even Bleach barely ever kills anyone off. Like in the real world, there's death and violence everywhere even if you can't see it on the surface. You win some you lose some, which is shown in Akame ga Kill!.Akame ga Kill! also has a nice amount of comedy and will probably have some romance as well, which balances the anime so it isn't completely action and eventually boring fight scenes.So far this anime is amazing and original, I can't wait to see the rest of the season.",3
akame-ga-kill,"After watching the first episode of this anime, I tried finding the manga. And even though I recently started it, I couldn't stop reading. I finished chapter 51 a few days back, and IT WAS AMAZING. Although some scenes were quite disturbing, there's comedy, romance, and action found in it. (And there is one thing I learned after reading it: don't get attached to anyone. If you do, your enjoyment of it will definitely go down. SO  BEWARE.) I have high expectations for the anime!!",5
akame-ga-kill,"By far the most enjoyable of Summer 2014.I haven't read the manga but watching it has made me want to read it now. The plot/pacing is very solid, the animation is superb and the level of violence is both disturbing and astounding.The character work, in particular, is what stands out the most for me. In just four episodes I already care about the characters in Night Raid more so than most anime's this season. Can't recommend this enough.",5
akame-ga-kill,"Do you like gore, sadness, despair, and your favorite character(s) to die? Watch Akame Ga Kill.The manga is some of the best out there, and the anime is following it religiously.Without spoiling anything, I will say there are moments in this show where you will most likely skip a heartbeat. The manga was that good. I own all the volumes.The anime has impressed me with great pacing and balancing talk and action with roughly 10-12 minutes of the episode talk and the rest seat jumping action.It's not like other titles (*COUGH* NARUTO *COUGH*), that have too much talk.Rather Akame ga Kill! is just so amazing. You need to watch this show and rate it after the first four episodes at least.Highly recommended.",4
akame-ga-kill,This anime has a lot of potential with what I have seen so far. I have only read the first few chapters of the manga and the anime follows it really closely. The combat is nice and the characters keeps getting better with every episode. The art style for the anime is extremely beautiful just like Sword Art Online and other animes. They all have a common goal to save the country from evil. (the story gets dark sometimes to really show how corrupt the country is) You should give the anime or manga a chance and will not be disappointed.,5
akame-ga-kill,"For me, this anime at first seemed fairly standard, but then it changed. Without spoiling anything, this anime made we genuinely worry about the safety of the characters. I was anxious whenever a fight broke out, which added to the stakes and tension. Spoilers, some characters die, but I never felt as though they were cheap. Some died simply in the fight, but it was used to reinforced the reality of conflict and the tragedy felt by both the heroes and myself. One death in particular left a plot line unfinished, but it was done in a way that made me feel sad and mourn the loss, rather than angry for the unfinished plot line. It mimics life in that death does not wait for happy endings, it takes us when it chooses. One that depressing reminder, it is a great series and one that I will highly recommend, but a warning to those who enter in expecting an easy watch. Prepare to be pushed to edge of anxiety. The type of anime that we sometimes need, Akame ga Kill! is one of the best anime I've seen and as an audience member, I've never been played so brilliantly by a writer before.",5
akame-ga-kill,"Akame is a shonen assassin show about a boy who gets swept up by a group of rebelling assassins trying to overthrow their despotic monarchy.  It's an interesting and compelling concept, but the execution is WAY off.  The characters are very shallow, and very unrealistic, which beaks all immersion, and the show kills them off at regular intervals without much payoff.  The cast would have been great in a more light hearted story, but with this subject matter it clashes horribly.  .BY FAR the most interesting and compelling relationship in the show is Esdeath and Tatsumi.  They have opposed world views and are generally almost perfect opposites, and are both the most developed characters in the show.  If the show were about their relationship and trying to influence each other and ultimately understanding each other and their feelings with the backdrop of the assassinations and rebellion etc this could have been amazing.  As it stands, the titular Akame isn't even the most interesting character in her own show, and the end is just one more let down.  I hear the manga is better so I may check it out, but the anime was a disappointment.",5
akame-ga-kill,"I know this anime is catching a lot of flak for not being true to the Manga, but I'm alright with it. I still developed a bond with all of the characters and it definitely leaves me wanting another version that is truer to the manga. I finished this feeling all sorts of emotions. But if we just continue to bash the anime then we will never get a reboot or anything because the only thing the producers care about for projects like this to take off, is if it can make them some money. If they think there is a market for it, they will do it. But we are not giving them hope by bashing this anime.",5
akame-ga-kill,"The story premise is fantastic and the main plot is fine in the beginning. However the story fails to convey any depth to the characters. You can always tell when a character is about to die because the writing is set up so that you're force fed a bunch of ""character development"" before killing them in a shocking fashion in the hopes that this will make the viewer care for the characters and get emotionally invested.",5
akame-ga-kill,"Right out of the batters cage, yes, Akame ya Kill! feels a bit rushed towards the second half. But with the new trend being a 2 installment, 24 episode run with more modern anime, I feel the rushing was justified and could have been terrible, which it was not. Besides some generic tropes, I see deeper, more nuanced messages in this show that people completely missed. People love to hate Akame ha Kill!. The dichotomy of pure evil versus pure good is traditional. Yet this anime not only explores the concept of pure evil for evil’s sake on the surface, but gives what we see as evil a more human face and an outlook from a particular upbringing that informs the character’s actions. And then we see those long held beliefs change over time. We also get to see pure good for the sake of good, how that came to be and where it would go. Some were corrupted and others stood strong. If I could go back in time I’d tell the writers to give this anime 50-100 episodes, something like FMA Brotherhood - just long enough to not feel rushed, but definitely long enough to explore each character and make the missions longer so we can see a more nuanced set of changes in the characters, their inner turmoil and set up the plot twists with a bit more anticipation. Overall I highly recommend the show and suggest going in not thinking “ok this is going to be a super serious show with something huge to say like the big 3 did.”",4.5
akame-ga-kill,"Some critics will tell you that the ending was sloppy and rushed where as I feel this story was perfectly told. You are placed in the daily life of people who has too commit everything they are for a cause. Since they work in the shadows there is no prize, no compensation and no happy ending. Being in the line of fire isn't a happy story and neither is losing your friends but sometimes you have too make sacrifices that is bigger than you can handle, sometimes you need too risk it all too make a change in the world. But who will know if your story is never told. Not all victories are happy and nothing gained comes without a price. It may be a sad story, but this story portrays the feeling of loss for victory perfectly.",4.5
akame-ga-kill,"So basically I don't want to spoil anything, but this anime left a minor hole in my heart with how it ends. It is very sad and very brutal. Even though I would have preferred a different ending, I will still say the author accomplished what he set out to do: make people feel sad. It explores the indiscriminate nature of violence and loss associated with war and combat. It also explores the concept that people may not always be remembered for their great sacrifices made to contribute to what they believe is the greater good. Both of these concepts leave a feeling of despair and hopelessness whether or not the protagonists accomplish their goal because the cost is so great. If they lose it is a total defeat and if they win its a pyrrhic victory. What makes it so sad and disturbing is that all of this violence and loss is portrayed by cute, fun and colorful anime characters. It starkly contrasts what the average anime would put forth in terms of plot, therefore, many things come across as shocking. Especially with the contrast derived from the colorful anime characters and the horrifying and dark concepts explored throughout the series. I so badly wish things would end differently, but if they did, the concepts and points established by the author would be made less meaningful. Yet I still find myself wanting an OVA or second season with some way to make things turn out different a few of the protagonists due to the despair and sorrow inflicted on me by this anime. Stand alone, this is pretty good. However, the manga is much better and has a better ending.",5
akame-ga-kill,this anime started off fantastically and followed the manga very well but as time went on they cut out many things especially towards the middle and the end of the anime. the oneSpoiler Alert! Click to show or hide i'm going to use is mine's and tatsumi's relationship in the anime is very sudden and has nothing really leading up to it also they cut out what in my opinion was a very good part of the plot the manga had with the imperial arms taking over their users body and manifesting themselves (tatsumi becomes a dragon at the end of the manga) but i still enjoyed this anime due to its well animated fight scenes and sticking semi close to the plot but i cant give it full marks for what is in my opinion a loss the series could have used in my opinion more down time between fights for character growth which in my opinion would have made Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideSpoiler Alert! Click to show or hidethe deaths of those who did die a lot more impactful rather then getting the feeling of well another bites the dust. i would still would recommend it to my friends who haven't read the manga though.,5
akame-ga-kill,"This show, while it was brilliant in pretty much every way, destroyed me. Never before has any form of media, whether it be books, movies, shows or songs, depressed me as much as this show. And I like to think of myself as a manly man. A big big boi. In fact I never cry, not even at the crushing disparity that is my life, although I did cry at the end of the Lord of the Rings.(Spoiler) But at every death scene, I myself died a little more inside. For every Night Raid member snatched away from us. Not for the Jaegers though. While this show does, admittedly, do a good job of trying to make you care for them, I like Night Raid too much to root for their rivals. Every death scene is set up beautifully beforehand, usually with some sort of touching moment shared between whoever will die next with either Tatsumi or another Night Raid member. And every relationship felt real and genuine. However, I say that this show is both a 0 and a 5, because it is at the same time one of the best and one of the worst shows I've ever seen. It's a brilliant, well crafted work of art that I thoroughly enjoyed watching. The music was great, the characters were all unique, they all changed in some way, and the villains were well crafted. However, the deaths were just too heart breaking and soul crushing. It seems people are never happy with these kinds of anime, because they're dissatisfied if no one dies and the character is invincible (like Death March Isekai), they're unhappy if characters die but don't stay dead (like Dragon Ball Z) and they're unhappy if everyone dies, like this show. The deaths are also a gentle reminder that everyone we know and love will die, sometimes in brutal, bloody, gruesome, horrendous ways, that should not be viewed by our unprepared, deliciously naive eyes. The mental trauma bestowed upon the viewer is also both good and bad. Chelsea's death is probably a popular example. She just wanted to be praised and accepted, and in her final moments, those are the thoughts that go through her head. This was at one time a great moment of the show, as her death felt extremely impactful, and a horrible one, because it was so hard to watch, particularly since she died alone, and in such a brutal way.All in all, although it will never happen, I would wish for a season 2 where Akame uses the power of the remaining Imperial Arms, and harnesses them, not necessarily to resurrect her fallen comrades, but to perhaps peer into the afterlife and see if they are all together, just for a bit more closure (There is a short animated ""theater"" series that does kind of show this, however I personally don't consider it canon and would prefer to see an actual ova or animation of this).Otherwise, amazing show, but don't watch it if you ever want to feel that thing called ""happiness"" ever again.",5
akame-ga-kill,"If you never watch this, you might be doing yourself a favor. Should you decide to, be prepared. This is a story about death and sacrifice. It pulls you in and you become enveloped in a world of desperation. From the start, becoming attatched to all of the characters is easy, but the story never quits. It even makes you question which side you're really on. This story makes you involved. Guard your heart. Watch at own risk.",4
akame-ga-kill,"I hardly ever review anything, so believe me when i say i thought that this was a fantastic anime. It is a simple cliche story of a boy from a small village attempting to become a hero... or so it seems at first. In reality it is focused on an elite group of assassins fighting to protect the people of the kingdom that they all love and loath to see rot. The character development is incredible, you grow fond of many of the characters, and the lines between good and evil blur as the story progresses and each story of the past is revealed. I have never felt such pure frustration and anguish than during the course of this series and the choices made by the writers, but that is a large portion of why I loved it. It was incredibly original. The fighting is gratuitous, but not to the point of just being a gore-fest, and the animation is very well done.I have not read the Manga as of yet, so I cannot vouch that it holds up, since the storylines diverge partway through, but i think that each should be enjoyed individually.TL:DR Bloody combat, Great animation, Different than Manga, Incredible Characters, Frustrating as hell, Original, 10/10",5
akame-ga-kill,"Let's start with the good: I thought the very initial idea was great; in a world of huge monsters, the worst monsters are actually human? How profound! I mean, it's nothing original, many have done it before, yet I had thought it would actually revolve around that. It did...and it didn't. All the villains are completely one dimensional, and are unrealistically inhumane to a point where it just feels really super cliched. Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hide I'll give points to humanizing the Jaegers, a small group directly under Esdeath (errg...I'll get to her later), but that isn't enough to forgive the rest of this show's ridiculousness.  One of the first things that bothered me was the title: you'd think in a show named Akame Ga Kill, Akame would be the main character right? Nope. Barely a supporting character to cardboard cutout protagonist Tatsumi.So that was immediately a disappointment.Doesn't even matter that Akame's character and history are INFINITELY more interesting than Tatorsumi, he's still the focus of the show. He even starts developing a harem! And that's to my next biggest issue with the show  Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hide Esdeath doesn't make any sense! Here you have a genuinely terrifying sociopathic antagonist with OP abilities, and...make her fall in love with the protagonist. That's right folks, the dictionary definition of Ice Queen turned up to 11 falls in love with Titorsami at almost FIRST SIGHT! Besides the fact that they really aren't shippable, but the fact that it comes out of nowhere and is completely out of character with said villain! But I digress. ANOTHER issue I have:Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideDeath. See that scissor girl? YOu know, the one with the glasses and purple hair you see on the cover to the right? Yeah, neither do I! She was kind of introduced, and then died. She really didn't have enough character for you to even care, but oh no! Anyone can die now! Doesn't matter if you don't have much reason to like them, they still die!  *sigh*I really had high hopes for this anime, but it's just another cliched shounen. If you don't mind any of the above issues (though it's more me ranting than anything), and like decent animation and fight scenes then go ahead, you'll probably enjoy it. Other than that...don't watch it. It's really not worth it. The manga is significantly better, if only for one ship  Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hide Wave and Kurome, you are the only reasons I still read it  you should read it instead. In the end, the only thing that differentiates this from any other shounen:  Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hide It's willing to kill off its main characters and humanize a handful of it's main villains. That's it  Watch it if you want your heart ripped out, but then have it concluded horribly.",5
akame-ga-kill,"I love this show. I loved it so much, was amazing. But the ending made me want to cry. No, it did not make me want to cry, it made me cry. I cried so many times during this. Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hide But the fact that literally everyone died, I was so sad. The entire show I was rooting for Tatsumi x Akame, and I mean, I genuinely hated the Tatsumi x Mine thing. I found it horrible. But idc that's my opinion. This show was amazing.

As long as tiny bit of hope exists, that is all that matter.”—Tatsumi.Akame ga Kill!  is a Japanese shounen manga series written by Takahiro and illustrated by Tetsuya Tashiro. It started serialization in Square Enix's Gangan Joker in March 2010. An anime television series adaptation of the main series premiered in Japan in July 2014. The story of the anime focuses on Tatsumi, a young villager that travels to the Capital, to become a soldier and to earn enough money to save his village. When Tatsumi reaches his destination point, he finds out that the country he wants to serve is rotten; however, one man cannot do anything against the whole country. Thankfully, Tatsumi encounters a group of assassin known as Night Raid. That group tries to assassinate all rotten politicians that do nothing but torture people, and to rebuild their country as a place, where all people have the right to live. Will the assassin group called Night Raid, together with Tatsumi, be able to change their rotten country? Find out the answer now. While the story line sounds intriguing, it has too many flaws to be good. To be more precise, it has three main flaws: it is rushed, it relies too much on death, and it is unclear whether the main focus of this series is comedy, drama, or action. Not only the anime suffers these three flaws, but also it does not explain enough: Akame ga Kill! does show characters’ backstories, but, at the same time, they are so short and sometimes do not make sense at all. The only explanation that I have is that the creators of Akame ga Kill! did not have enough resources, and so they decided to omit some scenes and to make the story of this series more rushed. All In all, this is one of the weakest parts on this series. The animation and sound are, perhaps, the reasons why this anime is actually watchable. But again, the animation is average and I would never call it unique. Yes, character designs are not bad and, yes, action scenes are fine, but it is still not enough to say that the animation is good. Some scenes are extremely beautiful, but some are just ugly. Anyway, luck of budget is obvious even here. The sound is more or less good: not only the ED and OP themes are good, but also the OST is very enjoyable. Also, good voice actors compensate for pale characters. The characters are,  not that bad and I would highly recommend you to only think about characters and about characters only, forget about the story. Anyway, let us discuss the characters. I will start with Akame (anime is called Akame ga Kill!, by the way). Akame is one of the main characters of this series, but despite having her name in the anime’s title, the anime does not pay enough attention to her persona; it does show us that she is always hungry, quite, and calm, her backstory is okay and it also makes sense, but it will be shown a bit too late. What I am trying to say is that when we first see Akame, the anime heavily implies that she will be the main protagonist of this series, this anime is called Akame ga Kill!, after all, but, for some reason, Tatsumi receives more screen time than Akame. The next character I would like to discuss is Chelsea. Chelsea is also a member of Night Raid, she is extremely beautiful, and her cheerful personality helps to make this anime less dramatic. However, the main problem with her character is that she does not do anything for the story, she is absolutely useless. She is a member of the Night Raid and this organization is the main focus of this anime, so, um, why not pay more attention to Chelsea’s character? The next character is Esdeath, the only Akame Ga Kill’s best girl. Not only she is interesting, but also she might be the only character you will have faith in. Yes, she might be called a plain villain, but her actions and her character overall, MAKE SENSE.  AND finally the last character I would like to discuss is Seryuu. While she is annoying sometimes, she is one of the characters that I like and you will probably like, as well. She does what she finds important to do and to achieve her goals, she is ready literally for everything. Anyway, I would not say that the cast of this series is extremely bad; it is average, but not bad: some characters do not receive enough development, some characters are absolutely useless, and so on. Again, the characters and the story are not the problem of this anime, the only problem of this anime is that it did not have enough resources. All in all, if you still have not seen Akame ga Kill yet, I would highly recommend you to either read the manga, or watch the anime. Of course, reading the manga will the best case scenario, it is just MUCH-MUCH better, but still, the anime is not that bad. Yes, it is far from being good, but just do not expect something good: be ready for an average drama with some action elements.",5
akame-ga-kill,"Personally, I thought this anime was fantastic. When you first begin watching this animated series, you are introduced to a young enthusiastic protagonist named Tatsumi. He quickly ends up teaming with a group of assassins known as the Night Brigade. At first, it appears that this team of assassins is unbeatable. However, while the story continues, this team encounters many difficult challenges and obstacles. As a viewer, I can guarantee you that you will tear up and ultimately feel distraught due to the outcome of this anime. Akame Ga Kill! has so much emotion involved within its dialogue and the story it makes me want to re-watch it all over again. To conclude my review, I give Akame Ga Kill! a much deserved 5/5.",5
akame-ga-kill,its an action anime series with decent story telling while i will say that the anime took a completely different route than the manga the show itself was still enjoyable and was what introduced me to the akame ga kill series if your a fan of anime with lots of action this show has plenty of it but if you want more story i suggest reading the manga its still going and some people i wont name are still alive in the manga that arent in the anime.However the show itself is an enjoyable watch.,5
akame-ga-kill,"If you hate yourself and wish to punish yourself with soul crushing emotional warfare, then this is the show for you.A great show, some characters don't get developed much, but others have so much depth that you grow deep connections with them.It's about a group of rebel assassins that seek to take out the tyrant empire, they fight using a large arsenal of interesting and cool weapons, the plot keeps itself together well and you never feel like something happened just because.As far as the manga goes, I didn't read it so I am not sure how it crosses over, but you need not read the manga to understand this story.The ending sure is a surprise but I feel that it's a good way to close it out.",4.5
akame-ga-kill,"i feel like the akame ga kill story writer had pms and destroyed the whole anime after episode 12 it had so much potential , hunter x hunter type potential ... but someone decided to destroy the whole show like please re-write the damn story it  gave me hope for anime and destroyed it after episode 12 like wt...... u good , r u 1 hunnid like u were going chief keef and u turned retarted , u hit the blunt , u good , keep it a stack fifty and re write the damn show f the manga because i dont read manga ,  eat a snickers bar , relax turn uhhhhhhhh, and if you dont want to rewrite turn the rights over to someone like me who can re-write the show and has passion for akame-ga-kill or drop another episode continue the show and turn it around",4.5
akame-ga-kill,"The thing that shocked me was how easily this anime just kills so many ""main"" characters. But only two of these all deaths was somewhat moving to me. The anime is cool with all the battles and weapons and some of the characters I really enjoyed watching, but the thing that this anime failed to do to me is to make me cry.I am a super crybaby and there were some dramatic deaths but I didn't feel anything. Maybe the anime didn't build much of affection and thus I didn't feel sad when someone died. More likely I was thinking, FUCK, what are the numbers on the enemy team, will this be a victory anymore? Overall it was amusing anime, wouldn't watch again though. I loved the gay big brother character so much. ♥",5
akame-ga-kill,"This is the 1st Anime that I've decided to write a review for. I read the reviews for the show before I started it, as I always do, and they all warned about a dissatisfying ending but I still wanted to watch the show because I loved the premise of the story.I wasn't disappointed. The story started of at a great pace with a fantastic 1st episode that did a good job of setting the tone for the series. The chemistry between the characters was good and they all had interesting backgrounds. The animation was fluid and the action wasn't overplayed. The MC is a relatable without being ridiculously overpowered and It has a good voice cast.I honestly thought the reviews were wrong...till around halfway to 3/4 into the story. Now I can't vouch for the source material, which people say varies from the manga in the later parts, but It just fell apart...completely. Characters were dying without meaning and reason. There were serious pacing issues and the story took a real turn for the worst. I forced myself to keep watch because I hate leaving a series unfinished but it was seriously the hardest anime for me to finish. It pains me to write this because the series had so much potential and it was just wasted. I want to be able to recommend this show but I just can't. If you can somehow forgive the horrible ending and wasted character development, then there is a fantastic half a series of Anime there.",5
akame-ga-kill,"I thought this anime was great, it has great animation, a good story line, something the viewer/reader can really get into. You get to know the characters and their stories and I really enjoyed that.BUT, I personally wish they wouldn't have killed off just about everyone. reason being is I want a second season let alone I wanted those characters to develop more and see them achieve something even higher than saving the capitol from corruption. Though, I do want to mention that I understand the need for some characters to die, i.e some main (but secondary) characters, but seriously all of them except like 2? You killed off the hero. THE PERCEIVED HERO. It does raise an idea, to me, that if they intentionally killed off everyone to reveal that there may be a second season because if you watch the last episode it leaves a small opening with akame seeming to maybe want to rid the rest of the world of possible corruption that could be left over. OR if we go back in the story to what Tatsumi was imagining, an Imperial Arms that can bring back the dead.Though, This is all speculation and the hopes of 1 fan.",5
akame-ga-kill,"Akame ga Kill seemed promising in the first couple of episodes, giving you the impression it will explore themes such as the corrupted nature of humans, the moral definitions of good and evil and the consequences of wielding weapons that come with a potentially huge cost.  What you get though is a series of one dimensional characters with a one minute backstory moving through a paper thin plot that's quickly forgotten as everyone faffs about.  Everything established in previous episodes quickly gets forgotten, especially the one rule that's supposed to make every battle poignant and meaningful since it stops applying about a third of the way through.  In fact, you could pretty much start watching from the middle and never need to know what happened beforehand.While it isn't the worst anime I've seen, Akame ga Kill just feels like a bunch of action looking for a plot to fill it out.  There are definitely some likeable characters that emerge from the soup of generic archetypes but for the most part they are conjured up for a specific thing then cast aside without ever really being developed.  There are some enjoyable moments when the anime remembers it started a plot in the first episode but for the most part it's a series of disjointed and contrived events with very obvious foreshadowing.  Check it out if you have nothing else to watch but there are many better alternatives to look at first.",5
akame-ga-kill,"Animation: Akame Ga Kill is beautifully animated throughout. I especially loved the raw looking aspect of certain scenes.  Characters: All the characters are unique, this anime really works at putting you in the characters' shoes, as they solve their problems in their own way. You'll really hate the antagonists, and you'll fall in love with the protagonists.Storyline: Akame Ga Kill's plot is detailed and doesn't drag on unnecessarily like a lot of other anime.Action: Prepare for edge-of-your-seat action starting from the very first episode, to the very last! The fights are well portrayed, as the Imperial Arms play an important role in making the action exciting and unpredictable.Voice-Acting: Some of the female characters sound quite similar, but overall the voice acting is decent.Dialouge: Amazing and deep. I often find myself using quotes from this anime.Music: The openings, endings, and score are all too perfect for Akame Ga Kill's genre. I found myself singing along to the opening after watching two episodes.Genre: Comedy/Action/Horror/Fantasy. The Imperial Arms also provide a sci-fi feel in much needed areas.Conclusion: Akame Ga Kill is a great anime and I recommend it to anyone looking for a thrilling, interesting anime.",5
akame-ga-kill,"Where do I start? Before I watched this anime, I believed that I had already seen the best anime I was ever gonna see ( which was A Certain Magical Index)  but I was wrong. When I first heard that Akame Ga Kill was GreenLit,I was shocked. The Main Male Character to me, Tatsumi matured and got stronger over the course of the series. The Main Female Character Akame acted like a very cold person but on the inside she was a very kind person that worried about her friends. I absolutely loved her character on the show. This anime had some of the most epic fight scenes I have ever seen in an anime. The action was great and fluid. But also this anime is very tragic, no one is safe in ths anime. The characters were awesome both Night Raid and the Jaegers. They all had their own reasons for fighting but they both fought for the sake of the friends they made/ their group.",2
akame-ga-kill,"Over the course of this animation, you will be moderately pleased by its semi-creative action-scenes. There is very little character development, and the social interactions between characters are somewhat cliché. Its hidden ruthlessness can pull emotional strings from the audience, but for the most part it seems a tad too forced. The setting is rather bland; a vanilla villain that demonstrates no originality comes up with rather shallow obstacles for the protagonists to quash. Overall, this animation is not a waste of time, but it will be forgotten due to its cookie-cutter characters and average plot.",5
akame-ga-kill,"This Anime is one of my favorite anime if not my favorite. The story fun and interesting, with hints of fan service and a god amount of humor that fits perfectly. This show is so brutal with it's fight style without including the art style, which is beautiful. If you want an amazing 1 season anime to get into, that wont keep going on and on. Then this is for you!!! I hope you try and enjoy Red-Eye Kill!",1
akame-ga-kill,"I have some mixed feelings about this anime. This was a good anime, with an interesting story, but seriously, this is the george r r martin of anime. Everyone gets killed off accept two, and even the paths they chose after the minister and others are defeated is lame. Pretty unhappy about the ending though. And dont get me started on Leone's lame death scene! 1) how does a flint gun have 10 rounds in it 2) why didnt she take the gun after the minister got down 3) how was she able to climb a tower to meet Akame, and roam the Capital, yet still die from bullet wounds.  BAH! The ending was bad. So much potential in this anime, but the ending made me feel like I wasted my time watching it.",4
akame-ga-kill,"This show was absolutely fantastic, until the final episode. Then it became an okay show. The ending completely ruined everything, in my opinion, but I’ll rant more about that later. Like I said, the show was pretty great up until that point, so it was obviously doing something right. I mean, I even stayed up till 4:30 in the morning on a school night to finish the show. It was addicting. Anyway, the show kept its focus on its characters and on the action, which is what a show like this should do. It didn’t focus on the plot, as it wasn’t original and it didn’t need to waste time developing it. A bunch a people trying to take down a corrupt capital? Seen that many, many times, so there was no point on focusing on it. These characters aren’t complex or anything, but they’re likable and enjoyable to watch. If you hated them, the entire show would be unwatchable, as you're supposed to be rooting for them to win. The action scenes are violently entertaining, beautifully animated, and plentiful. Once you’ve combined that with the likable characters, you have a pretty great show. Alas, the ending ruined it all. *SPOLIER FROM NOW ON* From here onward I’m probably gonna go into spoiler territory, so you’ve been warned. Ok, the final battle is happening, everything has led to this. Tatsumi dies from stopping the Emperor’s Imperial Arms from crushing everyone, Akame faces of with General Esdeath and wins, and Leone dies after being shot by the minister. That is what they go with. Now, I would have been ok with Tatsumi dying if he was a stronger, more complex character or if he and Akame would have had a stronger relationship. If he would have been more complex, I would have felt some emotion when he died. Instead I felt nothing to be honest. Since Tatsumi dies in Akame’s arms, them having a stronger connection would have also been a good way to make me feel sad. Alas, Tatsumi just dies and I didn’t really care. I have the same opinion about Leone’s death. I would have been fine with it, except for the fact that it came out of nowhere and felt incredibly rushed, sloppy, and all around stupid. After seeing her kick all sorts of ass, and survive having her arm cut off, seeing her die by gunshots was extremely underwhelming and stupid. The all powerful Leone was taken down by freaking gunshots. Lame. Those 2 things really made me angry and did take a lot away from the show quality wise. However, I don’t think they were enough for me to not recommend this show. It’s fun, addicting, and has plenty to appreciate, just has an awful ending. 6.9/10",5
akame-ga-kill,"It hooked me on the first episode! It has it's anime tropes like girl with pink hair, girl with giant D's, male protagonist who's scared of aforementioned D's, but it's got a really good story, enjoyable characters, cool action scenes, and some nice blood, gore, and dismemberment. It's also got an amazing art style, the animation is top quality, and it has some laugh out loud moments! 11/10 for Double D's!",4.5
akame-ga-kill,"I won't spoil the ending for anyone but i'm just going to leave it at being horrible in my opinion. But the anime itself was great, i often found myself on the edge of my seat in the action scenes, laughing my ass off at the humor, feeling disgust towards the ""villains"" and their actions, or crying at the tear-jerking moments this anime provides. Definitely worth a watch and would be 5 stars if it had stuck closer to the manga version and not had such a unfulfing ending. Well this is my opinion of the review so it's up to you whether or not you take it.",4.5
akame-ga-kill,"To be quite frank, I'm not sure how I feel about this. On one hand it's entertaining at times while on the other its writing is sub-par. I decided to watch it because of the kill the evil empire plot, which happens to be one of my favorite in literature, used in both Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood and Code Geass; both to which I love. However, AGK doesn't live up to the supposed hype I've heard of. I figured there were various reasons why and I did everything I could to figure that out and came into some form of a conclusion.The storyline itself is fine but the pacing doesn't help it. There were moments when characters die off faster than I would expect. Some sections of the series could have been more effective if they were on earlier. Such as Chelsea's development(or flashback for that matter) could've been moved back a couple episodes. The majority of deaths are single episodes dedicated to a character that make us feel something for said character at the very last second. That is mediocre writing in itself. But I liked how it was always moving forward and everything, somehow, had a relation to progress the plot, rather than go on into a new story continuously.The tone is constantly conflicted with random humor. It was really bothersome so I decided  to check out the source material. The source material also had comedic moments but the use of paneling was clever and didn't bother too much with the drama the majority of the time. But with the anime format, everything has the same amount of focus. It reminded me of Fullmetal Alchemist or Soul Eater, which were also like that in their mangas and anime. But even in a manga, it doesn't look good all the time and that goes for the anime as well. It ends up looking edgy when moments contrast like that.At some point, it diverged from the source material. From there, it went on with a lot of illogical moments where the tension dies down because of it. There was a heavy amount of needless moments that seemed convenient more than anything else.The characters were one-dimensional but strangely sympathetic in a way. Perhaps that's just the deaths speaking but whatever. The characters lack deep thought but they followed their ideologies accordingly. However, they didn't come out as sincere to me because of how they don't seem serious about what they did. There were a few standouts such as Esdeath, who everyone surprisingly loves. Myself included for whatever reason. The characters aren't bad, but in general don't have much depth to them. It's the same problem I had with SAO. ""Deaths and psychological themes don't make characters any better."" was the initial response in my SAO review, and the same goes with this. In fact, I think I can copy and paste the section from that review and it'll fit. But whatever.The animation is okay. It looks good sometimes but it's not necessarily consistent. As a whole, it lacked good fight direction. The cinematography seems random and you don't really know the positions of the characters or location. A lot of the movement didn't flow well together. It looks cool but is lacking in dynamic viewing experiences. But at least it keeps its fight scenes isolated rather than have an extreme use of terrain destroying attacks. The artwork look cool. I like the designs of the characters even if they do look extremely generic. But then again, I'm a sucker for action, fantasy designs and I guess these fit the bill enough. Another plus is the gore, I love it. I can't deny my love for a fun blood bath regardless. It doesn't seem needless and the blood looked great. I could always expect White Fox to animate blood properly after seeing Kanatagatari.The soundtrack was nice. Despite her lack of experience, I really like Sora Amamiya's voice. Her singing on the first opening and second ending was great and had great flow to it. And the background music does tend to fit the tone despite the tone's continuous deviating. But I'll give it that.The voice acting had some strong points. Namely because there were a lot of emotional moments but that's just the script. Tatsumi's voice acting was probably the best right after episode 8. It was a nice scene and was actually subtle in how it was handled. Overall VAs were good throughout and had a good consistency.It didn't fall into a sh*thole I guess, but it wasn't amazingly good. Enjoyable as it was, the writing is meh-ish more than anything else.1.5/5 stars",4
akame-ga-kill,"This is Akame Ga Kill!, an anime adaptation of the manga. After the anime exploded and everyone was on the hype train, people found out what kind of anime it was and what to expect of it (similar, but less hyped than Shingeki No Kyojin). While you may expect me to say that it was an emotional roller coaster (and it was), I'm going to focus on the story aspect and why the story is the true roller coaster. Now, I watched the anime without reading the manga so I had no background information on what to expect or really what is going on. At first I thought it was a generic action anime about a bunch of people with super powers fighting other people with super powers. After the shocker of episode one, I was brought down to the ground and realized that  this is some hardcore sh*t. Being a lover of dark stories (SnK, Fate/Zero) this was an instant favorite for me. There are three best parts of the roller coaster, the climb, the sudden drop, and when it stops and you process whatever just happened to you. A good roller coaster will keep your mind blank from the drop to the stop. Now imagine a roller coaster that was over hyped - it is said to be the greatest roller coaster ever with the best drop in the world. A must have experience so to speak. The climb was great and the drop seemed like it was crazy, but only after stopping do you realize that it was sort of over hyped and they were feeding you total sh*t the whole time.Now Akame ga Kill is similar to the over hyped sh*t feeding roller coaster - while it may have been a great ride, it still does not live up to the expectation, probably because they built it a lot differently from the blueprints (the manga). While I haven't read the manga, I've studied it enough to know where the anime went wrong. Verdict: If the anime wasn't an adaptation of the manga, it would've rocked the socks off of people. But it is, and the socks are half-way rocked off of but suddenly the just can't leave the feet anymore.",4
akame-ga-kill,"This anime is alright, I just wasn't too much into it. I looooooooove fighting animes and fighting anythings but I couldn't really love this anime because of the character development. Weird relationships between them all and harem like. The fighting wasn't very heart pumping. And the whole seriousness wasn't very realistic in my opinion because none of their relationships were realistic enough for anime standards. Also don't like how the characters are drawn. Not my type so 3 is as high as I'll go.",5
akame-ga-kill,Some of the characters don't get enough screen time. Sheele was the first killed and i felt nothing when she died. I didn't see her character involved enough for me to create a bond with her. The rest of the anime follows the rule that begin to kill your favorite characters until you are left with characters you did not care for. Definitely not my favorite anime but it wasn't a terrible waste of time.,5
akame-ga-kill,maybe it was the fact i was watching it with someone who has read the manga or maybe it was the fact that it took me so long to really sit down and watch this anime even through it was in my queue but that the point after a couple of episodes i got bored with the anime. the ending was not very interesting i guess since i new that people was going to die it should have been more exciting for me to watch but it wasn't it was just a monster of the week. it seemed we were all set p to see one main character when we should have been reading the title an known better even though that is true why would i care about her after more episodes then not her story is told and it reads like a bad b movie really she supposed to carry this anime after all this time because i really care about her after nothing happens with her for so long. just read the manga i heard it good,5
akame-ga-kill,"This anime, overall, was pretty good. The story was interesting and the action was very thorough. However, that being said, I had a few reservations.Many of the characters, I want to say a majority, were rather black and white. There was a bit of depth to them but honestly they came across as a little basic. Definitely a lot more could have been done with this series especially in fleshing out some of these characters. The plot, at times, left a little to be desired. There was a few questionable developments and a couple plot holes but generally it was alright; nothing that ruined the show for me.If you're looking for an action-heavy story of rebellion with just a smidgen of romance and about a gallon of gore, I'd definitely give this one a go. It gets four stars from me.",5
akame-ga-kill,"Assassins. Political corruption. Sublime action and suspenseful plot twists. Akame Ga Kill has all of the ingredients of an elite anime title.  Its concept tackles political ideals that straddle the line of good and evil—what one would consider right and wrong. It isn’t afraid to take major risks to prove itself suspenseful and keep its viewers engaged. It incorporates shock value all the while maintaining a light-hearted easygoing identity. Despite this, AgK is a lot like a restaurant special that’s missing that extra kick that’d make you a regular customer: It just isn’t as engaging as its unique direction suggests.Take Tatsumi, a young villager who quickly discovers that the Capital—the central hub of Akame Ga Kill’s universe— is ripe with corrupt citizens and government officials that outwardly abuse their power to satisfy their inner desires. Not long after reaching the Capital on a pilgrimage to make money for their homeland, Tatsumi and his friends are taken in by a family with the intent to torture and kill.  He is fortunately saved by a notorious assassin group, Night Raid, and decides to embark with them on a mission to put an end to the Capital’s unjust corruption— by any means necessary. This is easily one of Akame ga Kill’s key strengths.  Night Raid’s methods to destroy the Capital aren’t exactly righteous; rather, they are almost as brutal as their adversaries. Occasionally, they’ll face an antagonist that has contrasting ideals that are very justifiable and make you begin to question Night Raid’s character as a group. Unfortunately, for every thought-provoking opponent are also a few maniacal, psychopathic and shallow opponents you’d expect from a children’s superhero TV short.The anime does make great, bold efforts to introduce characters that are engaging and appealing, albeit in a not-so-productive fashion. While still wholly embracing ultra-violent and somber themes, characters still spend their time—more often than not — engaging in lighthearted banter and fan-service scenes. This remains a very unique quality trait of AgK that viewers can surely appreciate; that is, until you realize that meaningful backstory and character development often take a backseat to such focus. This undoubtedly results in major plot and character development that are exhilaratingly daring in execution, yet feel fairly unmoving and formulaic. Nevertheless, when the risky decisions pay off, they pay amazing dividends in the form of rich, heavy, and suspenseful content.If there is one constant to the makeup of Akame Ga Kill, it’d surely be its combat scenes, which are incredibly solid throughout. Power in the Capital is largely influenced by Imperial Arms, ancient weapons with superhuman traits. From blades made of scissors to man-eating mascot characters, this concept lets the imaginations of the creators fly, leading to high-octane action that always proves itself unpredictable. It’s quite impressive what producers have done in the areas of presentation, especially in an industry where blockbuster action titles are given budgets that are far more exorbitant in value. From the animation and acting to the soundtrack, Akame ga Kill certainly delivers, even if it isn’t quite a jaw-dropping affair.This, coupled with the shock value and risky storytelling will keep you coming back each episode to eventually reach a conclusion that is both intriguing and a bit rushed. While the manga is still ongoing in Japan, producers for the anime adaptation took the tall task of devising its own original ending to the series, with mixed results. While it isn’t perfect, it is hard to ignore the many mature themes the anime unflinchingly explores while attempting to preserve its blithesome shounen identity. Even at its surface, it proves to be a fun, bloody, attractive action anime that I’d easily recommend to anyone looking for that next fix.",5
akame-ga-kill,"this anime kept me surprised. people were dying left to right like crazy, the animation was great it had awesome characters etc. i honestly enjoyed this anime to the fullest and recommend it to anybody who enjoys anime. one thing is for sure guys is you cannot get attached to characters. you'll find a favorite character but then they will die, you might think you wont watch it anymore but you will. akame ga kill will always keep you coming back no lie...",5
akame-ga-kill,"This, just this anime was everything that I thought it wouldn't be. The thing is I actually started the first episode and stopped two minutes in. Biggest mistake of my life, one day I had nothing to do and I finally wanted to know why this show was on the most popular. Boy did I find out. I never really review animes, but this one has really changed my perspective on things. DO NOT get attached to anyone, because your in a world full of heartbreak if you do. I caught myself almost crying after several episodes. You must, must watch this.",5
akame-ga-kill,"When I first saw this anime, the beginning met my expectations. They were not hesitating to take risks and push it. I am not one that likes my anime sugar coated and all that because it gets to a point that there is no point in watching something that meets your predictions on a regular basis, so something like this was a breath of fresh air...for a time.Keep in mind there are a few spoilers here so I would suggest just skipping over the blurb that isn't labeled if you want to keep your surprise, however they do have some major points in my argument. So read it at your own risk.Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideOne of the main problems I had with the anime was the fact they decided to kill off so many characters when in the manga, they are clearly still alive and well. The anime itself not only kills the characters that are still alive in the manga, but they even kill off characters that makes you think the creators of the anime were all like ""Cause why not!? Let's just kill them because we have no use for them!"". The death of characters such as Mine and Leone were so incomplete and not within reason. Tatsumi I did not mind too much, since it is not everyday you see the main character die, but still there was no need when the manga is not even at that point.The animation is great and all, along with memorable and lovable characters that will stick with you through the whole thing. But the way it moves off from certain characters was rather disappointing for me. I wanted to see more of a certain few characters when they appear to have far more of a story than what is given to us. It basically feels incomplete.Even the build up to the point the final battle(s) felt underwhelming. We were suppose to believe that this major battle was going to go down and all that, but with the inconsistency in the actions along with reactions with both sides in the war made it feel that it was rushed to a point it was unbearable. Now I did enjoy it up to a certain point, do not get me wrong. But after the first half, it began to be tiresome and the end left me unsatisfied on so many levels. Especially when the anime creators decided to put their own version of the events (including the ending) when the manga does not mention them at all since it is still incomplete.I would not be surprised at all if we see a remake of this anime when the manga is complete because the major changes they made were not only unbearable from not only the manga-first person's perspective but the anime-first viewer as well.",2
goblin-slayer,"(Disclaimer: I will be changing this review how I see fit as more episodes are released so my review might fluctuate within episodes on how I feel and leave it rated as). Currently I have found time to write a new review, I shall rewatch the whole season so I make sure I don't miss anything for my final review.I love how one episode is already out and someone already cried about it being too brutal which I'd say good job on that, means you're obviously doing things correctly over there pissing them all off!. It's lovely how people don't give a whole season a try before giving a review (Wish I can review those reviews to tell them to go more in-depth). Going back onto how I think about the first episode so far is that how it was executed which much to my amazement it PERFECTLY captured the first arc in the manga and that blown my mind, it was as dark in the anime as it was in the manga which I LOVE!!!! Props for so far following the first chapter flawlessly and not leaving anything out! Onto the art style and visuals, The cg can be horendous at times but other than those few times like parts where Goblin Slayer was cg instead of being drawn. Only at certain times you can tell something is cg but it's not like the third season of Overlord *cough* anyways I absolutely loved it and I plan on changing my review as the series goes on! All I can say is this is Doom Guy but with Goblins and the name is changed to Goblin Slayer. Also the music that played while he walked in was just bada**hopefully the rest of the soundtrack follows that direction which would be absolutely WONDERFUL since it matches what the anime's mood is about! This anime is really inspired by Doom and The Punisher...So episode two came out and it expands the history of who Orcbolg (Goblin Slayer) is and why he has a certain hatred for Goblins. Currently this has me waiting for the next episode since after the outro there was a little clip showing what the next episodes has to offer. So far I am enjoying the anime since it follows almost identically to the manga! Not to mention the opening is so epic! I'll probably will be listening to this on repeat for the next couple of days just for how good it is.Episode Three:  So far they are taking their time establishing lore and new characters in Goblin Slayer, this episode specifically was to introduce the Elf, Lizard Priest, and the Dwarf Shaman as Goblin Slayer's party (for now). Don't have much else to say until the fourth episode comes out.",4.5
goblin-slayer,"This anime starts of as many fantasy adventure's do; light hearted with beautiful score. However things turn intense and graphic very quickly. If you are weak of stomach or faint of heart this anime is not for you. If you are itching for something with more edge than a warriors sword, que no further.Viewer discretion advised. Features intense violenceRapeNudityand the equalivent of the Punisher with a sword.",5
goblin-slayer,"I am writing this review immediately after watching the first episode, so I hope my observations hold true.  But I am very impressed with Goblin Slayer so far!  For too long shows in the action/adventure and fantasy genres have treated combat as some glorified dance.  Even shows that portrayed real violence often downplayed the brutality that combat can engender.  Don't understand the difference I'm suggesting?  Gettysburg was violent; Iwo Jima was brutal.  Bayonets are violent; napalm is brutal.  This show is dark, ugly, and unsettling.  This show, despite being fantasy, is very real (and I understand that the source material depicts much worse brutality).  This was needed, and I'm happy to see it here.  I only hope that they don't try to lighten it.",5
goblin-slayer,"WARNING! DON'T LET THE CUTE ANIME GIRL FOOL YOU! This show is not for those with fragile spirits! It is violent a gruesome! You have been warned!If the anime follows the Manga/light novel faithfully (and based on the first episode it probably will) Goblin Slayer is going to take you on a brutal, violent, and frequently tragic journey.The world is loosely based off of Dungeons and Dragons rule sets and there's absolutely no ""POWER OF FRIENDSHIP"" deus ex machina nonsense in this story. Our boy Gob slayer is just a man on a rage induced quest of revenge to completely eradicate all Goblins off the face of the world. He does so with experience, experimentation, creativity, determination, and above all, ruthlessness. He HATES goblins and shows no mercy to them.I won't bother with any more details about the story but I will say if you enjoy old school anime that never shied away from violence and horror on a realistic level, You're gonna like Goblin Slayer and watch the team RIP AND TEAR!",5
goblin-slayer,"A lot of people are reviewing this writing ""rah rah rah rape shouldn't be in an anime rah rah rah"" or that the fact that rape was shown makes it a bad anime...first of all in any Lore about humanoid species and especially Chaotic evil types, rape is a common theme, this anime is supposed to tap into the absolute DARKNESS that is adventuring, I mean Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash was brutal (skipped on rape so many probably would prefer that)Watch the anime for what it is, don't hate on it because you find its storytelling disturbing, I'm betting each one of the nay sayers at one time watched an anime that had a sick or twisted scene and absolutely loved it where others turned green in sickness.Can't wait for the next episode of a more realistic world based on brutality and magic, a world comprised of people who actually risk something to get something, a more REAL take on what Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash delivered.",5
goblin-slayer,"First off I'll say this is NOT for everyone. This is not even for MOST people. If you are easily disturbed do not watch this show. If debasement, rape, child murder, etc. is too much for you, do NOT watch this show.This show is as realistic as a fantasy anime can be, I suppose. In the real world, women in war get raped, disgusting as it is, this show has that. In the real world, people make mistakes in battle and die quickly. This show, at least in the first episode, is unforgiving in that. In the real world people piss themselves in fear of death and being raped. This show has that as well, some of you sick pervs will probably even like it. I've read reviews that people don't like this show because the characters in the first episode are inept, useless, etc, especially the main priest girl. Well, I say this is realistic. People who have never fought or killed before TEND to be USELESS in a fight to the death, especially a fight as brutal as shown in the first episode. Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideI read a review where a person couldn't figure out that the reason she couldn't heal the wizard was because her healing magic doesn't cure poison despite the show explaining it to everyone who cared to watch. I imagine those people were too busy typing their one star reviews to actually pay attention to the plot  In this show, experience, pragmatism, and guile count for more than friendship, a plucky attitude, and refusing to give up. Or, at least, it would seem so from the first episode. I made update my review as the show continues.",5
goblin-slayer,"It implied rape and dismemberment within the first 10 minutes. I can respect that, Doesn't shy away from blood but should really be showing the gore too. This feels like it should be brutal but I feel like its skating around showing it.Still the goblin slayer is an excellent professional character who treats the goblins like they are rats needing to be exterminated and he does not hold back or give them an inch. With him as the cornerstone character keeping this show together I feel like this will be a good show, just not great because they are too scared to really show the brutality they like to imply.",5
goblin-slayer,"...brutal take on the dungeon crawler genre. It's a really good show. Really nice with a D&D show that's not just another dish on the same recipe. Better than Berserk (The animation, not the manga), almost as good as Drifters and Hellsing. Watch if you like shows like that. Skip if you prefer Danmachi and SAO. And that being said, it's really not that bloody. Berserk and Drifters are far worse. But it's not shonen either.",5
goblin-slayer,"As a manga and light novel reader and fan, I was was ecstatic to see this series blow up like it did. With already four manga adaptions and an anime in its first two years of existence. However I was also very worried that the anime would shy away from what makes this series stand apart from its many peers. To my surprise this was NOT the case. Studio WhiteFox does it again with this adaptation. It captures the atmosphere of the manga and light novel shockingly well. The dark themes were rampant, the music was very appropriate, the art and animation are stellar and the CGI was acceptable so far. For new fans and watchers, I say give the first episode a watch. Unlike most shows you will know immediately if its for you. With that being said, the series actually gets better with time and is about much more than just the dark themes shown in that episode. If they keep this execution up, Goblin Slayer has the potential to easily be the show of the season.",5
goblin-slayer,"There has been a bit of controversy about this show. And I can see why; it gives a more realistic depiction of violence than most other anime series I have seen.The main character hates goblins. I mean truly hates them; he is genocidal. In one particular scene he clubs to death a group of goblin children. And the narrative seems to support him in that. There doesn't seem to be any subversion of the character or situation whatsoever, it's straight up ""Goblins are evil and deserve genocide"".Combat is hectic and frightful, with the characters fighting not just for victory, but for their lives. Downed heroes are crowded on and brutalized.Some female combatants who are defeated, and female civilians, are raped by the goblins, both on and off screen. Nothing sexually explicit is shown, but it's clear what is happening.If you're an adult, and can handle it, it's a good show. Solidly written and animated. Younger viewers should not watch it.",5
goblin-slayer,"Hands down the best anime of 2018. Great story as it takes a different look on the mmo adventurer anime,  its not the cheesy loot driven feel good game that you login with your buddies anime but a realistic take on what being an adventurer tasked with killing and putting their lives on the line would actually mean. The artistry and animation are top notch, the fights aren't based on the characters almighty strength or convenient power boosts that some other anime fights monotonously follow thru every episode. Overall great anime and certainly worth the time watching.",5
goblin-slayer,"This anime is great! Halfway through, I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. I was so scared and anxious at the same time to see what was gonna happen next! Sure there are a lot of darkness and some people can't handle that, but that's what makes this unique compared to other anime. Ok maybe berserk has some similarities, but the way this anime started out was greatly executed. This anime got my attention and it's only the first episode. I hope this can continue to build up and not rush things. I definitely want to see more darkness since it plays around with my emotions a lot. For others, I don't recommend this anime to you if you can't handle this amount of blood and horror. However, this is a great anime.",4.5
goblin-slayer,"It definitely is remenicsent of a DnD tabletop game, but with a several added in fantasy bits. The character is a bit of a trope, but it works as they don't try to expand his reach too much and grows his character slowly. The supporting characters are great for filling in as support, and each one of them covers the basic tropes and stereotypes so nothing new there.Overall, the story is great, its simple yet gives the complexities of how difficult something seemingly-insignificant can be. I will say that there are consistent fan-servicing parts, but as this plays into the theme and purpose of the main character, its accepted.",4.5
goblin-slayer,"If you're a fan of Tabletop RPGs you'll like Goblin SlayerLet me start off by saying I read the first chapter of the manga and saw the rape and I immediately had the same kneejerk reaction that a lot of the anime community had in response to the first episode. But however I kept reading and now watching and the series is pretty great, though there are some minor things cutout of the anime in order to save time which is sad but understandable.The fact that the Protagonist Goblin Slayer uses inventive ways to handle various situations is reminiscent of playing D&D and how creative you can get with your actions and plans, also there are heavy handed references to D&D and other fantasy genres such as Lord of The Rings which is really fun to see.If you watched the first episode or know someone that watched only the first episode I heavily encourage you to watch an episode or two more to see that it's not always doom and gloom!",5
goblin-slayer,"Four Episodes in and the series finally starts to feel it is finally finding its footing and pacing. Which is quite understandable with what needed to be phased out of the first two episodes of the series. Some of you may have guessed by now that one of the big things about the manga was it's vivid depicting of the shock factor. Which did not shy away from striking depictions of rape amongst other things. As disturbing as those moments were though, they did help set the pace, tone and narrative that is the Goblin Slayer series. They help elevator the dangers and horrors of Goblins, establishing not only the fear of a brutal death, but the terror of not dying. And set the tone of what makes Goblin Slayer the person, different from adventurers.By glossing over the first band of adventures (which ruins the fake out that these characters were more involved with the series) and entirely removing the 2nd group of adventures from ep. 2 as well as glossing over how dire and needed goblin slaying is; Goblin Slayer's overall presence comes off a bit diminished then in the manga. We don't get to see the clear difference in his experience not just compared to novices but even a band of experienced adventurers unfamiliar with Goblin tactics. These simple and understandable changes lead to some awkward pacing. Luckily the brutally of Goblin Slayer is enough to hold a fans attention and the series does its best to reintroduce some of the dialogue and ideas back in other ways but a bit of balance is lost when they skip over some of the dialogue and narrative as it originally was.Episode 3 is a bit awkward too since it also cuts some world and character building as well as crams in more of the manga into an episode then it probably should have, but the pay off comes in Episode 4. Episode 4 comes out untouched by censoring and the dialogue and narrative are allowed to flow at it's intended pace. We finally get into the more methodical nitty, gritty approach of the series then the hinted at or glossed over aspects of it from earlier episodes. We get a much better idea and feel of Goblin Slayer's experience and drive. The things that make him different from an Adventurer. The things that make what he does different from an adventure. The things that honestly make him better then the average Adventurer.Luckily at this point, the series will go into more and more in what makes Goblin Slayer who he is rather then showing off more shocking moments that need to be censored out and NOW is when I start to get excited for the series. Now that pretty much the porn is out of the way, we can get into the grit of the series. And honestly now that the series seems to have found itself, it makes the first 3 episodes a bit more understandable and bearable.",5
goblin-slayer,"slay em all i say. goblins are always represented as funny little creatures that are just easy to scare off or defeat. if goblins were real, they would be like me. disgusting and slimy little creatures that have no regard for morality or ethics. cant wait for goblin slayer to kill all those repugnant green homunculi so the world will be a much better place. i can deal with the dark stuff as long as i one day get to see a goblin free world.",5
goblin-slayer,"Waited for this anime for so long its dark gorish and a hint of rape like berserk well not hint many hints. Animation is slow in some parts, the does not matter as anime follows manga truthfully. Voice actors are really well selected especially  the goblin slayer great dsrk voice and great acting. Sound design has a really well place eerie sound and music.Summary of Story is just about a guy who hunts goblins only he never takes any other quests and people one by one take a liking to him as he hunts goblins.",5
goblin-slayer,"To begin with, this not your typical adventure anime with the overused plot of an overpowered protagonist with a harem cast.This anime is gory and brutally realistic (in terms of how foes treat their enemies).The first episode introduces you with a adventurer group accepting a quest to hunt goblins.  Don't be fooled by the initial light-heartedness however. This is where the element of realism comes to play. Rookie adventurers who head into a battle half cocked and unprepared will surely suffer the harsh consequences. The goblins, all-male group have been known to kidnap young girls and women from villages thus adventurers are tasked with taking care of the menace. With that said, you can probably figure out what the goblins do to the young women in order to procreate. Unfortunately, some reviewers will give this anime a 1-star rating simply because of that. The wilderness of a medieval fantasy world is lawless and unfair. Murder and rape exists in these type of settings. If you can not handle that, don't watch this anime.Further into the anime we are introduced to the man simply known as Goblin Slayer. He is not the typical overpowered hero in the sense of just having ""unproportionately bloated stats"" but uses experience and tactics for the most part to outwit and trap the goblins as he combats them. It is a refreshing and thoughtful approach to introduce the protagonist.The anime also features amazing music and sound that draws you in and build a level of suspense, desperation, or hype.All in all, If you can't handle gore and rape done in a manner that is realistic and adds to the story (and not simply for the sake of doing so), then this anime is not for you. For those that want to enjoy more mature or seinen elements like Berserk in their adventure anime then this anime is right up your alley.",5
goblin-slayer,"After watching the entire season for myself, I feel like many of the reviews that are scoring this anime low, never had much interest in it in the first place. They simply ""watched"" the first episode with the intent to be malicious. They harbored no intent of giving it a fair shake. All in the name of trying to potentially ""shame"" the creators/writers for using such dark themes. Others, however, may not of had such intent and I can understand that so long as the reviews were well thought out. However, I intend to provide my own opinion on the content within this show based solely on the overall basis of:- story- characters- deliveryStory: Governed by the gods, the world and it's denizens are shaped with every throw of the dice. However, there is one that goes unnoticed by the gods, for nothing is expected of him. To them, he is but a small pawn, in their game of chance. Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideWhat they don't realize is that he, the unnoticed, defies the dice. Not letting the gods roll for him.Characters: Goblin Slayer - Instead of seeing this world through the eyes of the heroic hero(s), we are treated to witnessing the world through Goblin Slayer. A character that is more along the lines of what usually would be a side character to most viewers. He isn't all powerful, heroic, or virtuous like we see in things like Sword Art: Online, One Punch Man, etc.. Goblin Slayer is just another villager that witnessed a severely tragic event that shaped both his personally and his motivation for continuing to exist.  Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideHis sole purpose in life has become the eradication of all goblins. Intent on killing them all down to the very last child, so that no one else will have to go through the pain of losing loved ones, their homes, everything, to a goblin attack like he did.  Priestess - A 15 yo magic caster that has come of age and decided to become an adventurer to better help people. Young and naive, she could be considered to have a heart of gold but learns quickly that the world is not a nice place. A partial ""damsel in distress"", you could say, that slowly grows along side Goblin Slayer. She really felt like missed potential to be a better overall fleshed out character. Often being considered a nuisance by viewers because of her inability to ""grow a spine"" per-say.  However, I feel like she is a good counter balance to Goblin Slayer. Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hidePlaying a part in helping Goblin Slayer slowly gain bits of his lost humanity back through their interactions, both in town and while on quests/adventures. High Elf/Dwarf/Lizardman - I'll mark this as spoiler simply due to precaution. Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideA group of silver adventures that are hired to handle a goblin problem by the representatives of the great races. The group overall has a good dynamic of comedy in the form of the interactions between the Dwarf and High Elf. Meanwhile, the Lizardman is more mild tempered of the group, trying to keep the bickering down and be a voice of reason. They bring a nice finishing chemistry to the ""main character's party in the anime. Delivery: The anime finds a balance of both drawn and CG that works out to a fair quality. There will be times that it can be clearly noticed but overall it doesn't feel as terribly relied upon in comparison to say, 3rd season of Overlord. The detail given to the backgrounds are a nice quality that helps build upon the setting that the characters find themselves in. Providing a good sense of depth and atmosphere for viewers. The music, oh lord, the music! The composition of the various tracks are breathtaking and so beautifully composed to fit what is happening during each episode. Selecting a good track to be played during key moments in a scene can be critical. In the end, I feel like people have too strong of an attachment to main characters of anime that fit the ideals of morality or society of real life. Even the themes seem to be expected to shy away from things that we may consider immoral or improper to show. However, not all anime are going to be written with the intention to fit these things. If they were then we'd end up with hardly any variety and potentially with lack luster anime to enjoy. I greatly enjoy when an anime delves into showing some darker themes. As long as these themes are needed for the story and this anime does much better with the darker theme in place. Not all stories are sunshine and rainbows. Neither do all main characters need to be virtuous champions of justice.",5
goblin-slayer,"After watching the 11 episodes available, I have to say this is one of the more grounded fantasy series available.  There have yet to be attack moves being called out before their usage (aside from the mage types or clerics, but they are casting spells). The tactics used and reasons for the actions taken are very believable.  This is definitely not for the squeamish, because the consequences of thinking this is another lighthearted fantasy anime will have you thinking differently before the end of the first episode.",5
goblin-slayer,"Anyone calling this a ""Dark"" and ""Edgy"" anime are, semi right but also partially wrong.This anime uses shock factor just to say ""Fuck you this isn't some generic SAO bullshit if you can't stomach it then fuck off"" And that's why i love it. The whole point of the anime is to be unique and different. Many people say that this is a Berserk rip off just because of the gore and concept, and i honestly do see the connection, Berserk was was most likely an influence on GS which is another factor about this manga and anime that i loVE!Also lizardman is a top tier waifu, up there with speedwagon",4
goblin-slayer,"There hasn't been an anime in quite a while that has had the value that I believe Goblin Slayer has. The over the top violence, adventuring, and phenomenally written characters add to the beauty of this anime. It portrays a human character, who is only powerful because of his skill, wit, and ingenuity and though by episode 4 there hasn't been much touch up on it the viewer seems to be very connected to the internal struggle of the Goblin Slayer which is very present in the manga. It just is seems to fit the genre of Japanese anime it is categorized in very well. Compared to other current animes Goblin Slayer stands out as the one anime to truly derive from the current meta with a uniquely dark tone. Though some people find this to be a bad thing that hurts the show, it is exactly what gained its popularity. An amazing manga and the director not being afraid to follow the story no matter what people say. Plus also it's very much like Berserk which draws lots of fans from the manga to this animated series. Another derivative is the fact that so many people seem to connect it the way D&D is played, the whole over the top and creative direction some scenes take adding to the fan base and positive feedback.-A must watch if you're into a darker story (even though I could argue that it's not as dark as people think) or enjoy Doom, you'll love this anime. Great characters, interesting directive, phenomenal animation, and action that'll have your heart beating faster. Hope this review was helpful, or you at least enjoyed it. Thanks and have a good day my friends (｡◕‿◕｡)",5
goblin-slayer,"I will start by saying this: THIS IS NOT A FANTASY SHOW FOR THE YOUNG OR IMMATURE! Of course, if you've seen ANY of White Fox's other anime (Akame ga Kill, Re:Zero in particular) You'll know that they're no strangers to over the top violence and brutality. There's moments that make you want to close your eyes and turn away because of how horrifying and disturbing they are. That said, it's a very good show so far. My only real complaint is the CG style in which the eponymous named character is sometimes animated in, is...not the best. There's a lot of people bashing this show online (I'm looking at you Twitter, Tumblr, etc.) and the raving criticisms are completely based on ""triggering"". Watch the show, that's my advice, BUT be warned that there are things you will see that aren't for the faint of heart. If you saw Akame ga Kill or Re:Zero though, you'll be fine.",4
goblin-slayer,"Let me start out by saying this is not your typical happy go lucky fantasy anime. Its edgy and brutal and far more realistic than some have the tolerance for. However, I find that it stands out in an ocean of sappy mediocre anime's. I believe that you should reserve judgement for any new show for at least 5 episodes to establish its characters, plot, and story line.  As for me I was hooked at episode 1.",4.5
goblin-slayer,"There is much controversion on social media regarding this anime, so I gotta also refer to that. We have some of those ""We need to stop this rape culture"" comments. To those I respond: ""Dude, this is about a man who is trying to do just that""Rape scenes and brutality - yes, they are here. But not for the sake of controversy itself. Thanks to them you are able to understand Goblin Slayer motives. Have you ever seen your loved ones hurt? If so, you will understand it as well.For me this anime is about the fact that goodwill has many different faces. Here we have that in form of GS and priestess' faces. One is stern and focused on punishing evil as a concept, another is cheerful and just wants happiness of others. And regardless of side you are on, both those faces need to support each other.",4.5
goblin-slayer,"Hey guys, manga reader here. I just want to start this review off by saying that I won't spoil any plot points. However, I will say that you will not regret watching this anime. The first episode was quite controversial, and there will definitely be depictions of rape and gore through the entire series. However, calling this anime a Bezerk clone is a gross misrepresentation of what this series is.For starters, the plot. The plot is pretty simple, and you get the gist of everything in the first few episodes. Goblin Slayer is a man who, as a child, witnessed the murder and rape of his family and the destruction of his village. He then devotes his entire life and being to killing every goblin he can. His party grows eventually, and he slowly begins to see more to the world than just killing goblins. You see, the meat of the plot comes from character development, and the interaction between the party members.The cast of characters are all loveable, as you will eventually get to meet them as the episodes progress. I find every character in interesting and entertaining, and I am seriously looking forward to meeting the cast in this anime adaptation. So far, the voice acting is very good, and they did well to capture the tone of all of the characters. Music is quite good, and I enjoyed the opening, even though I normally hate engrish in anime. Fits the tone of the show very well, however. Another note, there will definitely be dark moments in the show, but there will also be moments of humor, as well as cute girl moments. This really helps to balance out the anime really well. If you're still on the fence, trust me. You'll be glad to stick with this show. And while you're at it, give the manga or light novel a try. Some things that the anime just can't capture will be there, including some internal dialogue and character interaction.",5
goblin-slayer,"It begins with a group of four giggling happy adventures off to make a name for themselves. They lack experience, but they wish to learn by doing. We see this a lot in anime. Just this false sense of strength, because the characters believe in themselves. The first episode shows what can happen if you don't prepare. It's good to be confident and it's good to want to learn. This group took up a task, and had no clue what it was they were getting themselves into. A prepared experienced adventure comes to the aid of the group. His actions highlight just how prepared one must be to live life as an adventurer. It's a life without easy choices.Edit: I've just started reading the Manga, and it's really good. Feels like it was very much inspired by DnD. There is always a strategy to all the fight scenes. It makes it more fun.",5
goblin-slayer,It is not for the faint of heart. If it continues to follow the source material it will be an amazing dark adventure. I look forward to more. It's hard to write a review without spoiling but be aware that the violence (of all types) continues. For those whining about the rapey goblins remember one of the ways they procreate is from kidnapping women. Also it serves a purpose and is a huge factor in backstory.,5
goblin-slayer,"Please Note that this is an episode 1 review along with knowledge of the manga and I will try not to spoil anything that comes down the road.That said there a few things going for this anime. First - the light novel that's its based off of is good (so I hear) and the manga adaptation is fantastic. Based off of episode 1, I would say the anime will follow the same route. And second the animation of this show looks to have been done in the best possible route for it. There are a lot of points I could mention but the best easy to show comparison from episode one are the two lead characters were are introduced to. Goblin Slayer and The Priestess. The later is bright and cheery in both design and nature, what you would expect from your typical anime heroin, while the former, Goblin Slayer, is darker, depicted in more realistic tones and colors but still having the silver of steel to show that he is indeed the protagonist (I don't know if we can call him a true hero) of the story.Story Summery:Goblin Slayer follows an adventurer in a fantasy world that is known as, you guessed it, Goblin Slayer. He's a silver ranked adventurer, the highest rank you'll see in the field, but nearly exclusively hunts goblins. Hence, the name and this is his story. My Thoughts:Now this show is very gritty, it is dark to the extreme and goes over many troubling and disturbing themes, scenes, and aspects of life. Due to this, the anime and manga are what I would call a hard R, because of the subject matter involved. The story is still great and quite possibly is accentuated by this fact, however; if you do not want to see gruesome deaths, (and no, not your typical anime death, a more realistic and terrible death), rape, and other dark matters littered through your story, I HIGHLY advise you to pass over this show. If you are okay with seeing it, I HIGHLY recommend watching this show. It appears that the anime is using tools of the trade to not directly show some things that were in the manga, likely to have an easier time airing the show on television, but we will have to wait and see if that is true or not, since after all this is only an review of the show based off of episode 1.Summery: A great show to watch but is Hard R with disturbing themes so think carefully before you decide to watch it.",5
goblin-slayer,"Warning, I'm going to be spoiling a little bit. not the plot or events that happen but the tone of the next few episodes.A lot of people came into goblin slayer expecting something way lighter and are calling it edgy for the sake of being edgy based on the first episode; But, that's the entire point of the first episode! it's to establish the cruel nature of this world's goblins and to show you how terrifying it is for the weaker inhabitants of this world to deal with them. the rape scene was to show what happens to the women who are captured by the goblins, they killed those characters off to make you HATE the goblins. And that's why when Goblin Slayer shows up and fucks them up it feels so damn good. The show isn't going to be nothing but gore and hard core stuff(it will still have a fair amount of it though) it has other elements to make it enjoyable, those moments will be interlaced in comedy and interesting character interaction. so before dropping it and writing it off as a berserk wanna be watch til the 2nd or 3rd episode.",5
goblin-slayer,"I'm reviewing this having only seen the first episode, which is all that has been released to date, nor having read the manga.Plot - 10/10The plot appears to deliver on its promise, hence the 10/10 rating; the lynch-pin of the anime is the Goblin Slayer, who slays goblins in this episode and presumably slays more in those to come. It's clear the focus of the plot is to create grounded and hard-hitting scenes, rather than forge a story riddled with intrigue and nuisance, which I think is perfectly fine.You don't expect cordon bleu food if you visit a restaurant called Bubba's Flame Grille, you'll go there for big racks of tender ribs, so it's sensible to rate the food based on how well it delivers on its promise.Animation 10/10Looks good enough to meet my low standards, but I think it will suffice for most people.Violence 10/10Anything with ""Slayer"" in the title makes one anticipate scenes of extreme violence, and this show most certainly doesn't pull any punches. Nothing is censored, the gore is realistic, the swordplay is realistic and Mr Slayer isn't a pansy who turns the other cheek for seemingly no good reason, only to get burned by it later. He's climbin' in yo windows, he's snatchin' yo goblins up, and he won't leave until he's slain them all.Is This Show For Everyone? 5/10Definitely not for everyone, much as Berserk, Attack on Titan, Overlord, BTOOM!, Drifters, etc are not shows suitable for all audiences. People for whom this show might/will be unsuitable include:- Children- Millennials who demand for ""trigger warnings"" before seemingly everything ( Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideThe goblins rape girls in this show, the purpose of which being to create emotional stress in the story rather than to titillate the viewer. )- People who are squeamish with regard to graphic violence and gore- People with Bogyphobia (i.e. ""the fear of the bogeyman. People with this fear also dislike demons, goblins, spirits, etc"")Overall Opinion: 5 starsIf you're looking for a brutal, emotionally hard-hitting show involving a dude who wrecks goblins and 1v9s, then this is the one for you. This show is what I hoped Berserk 2 would be like, but sadly that was not to be.",5
goblin-slayer,"Absolutely brutal. If you were expecting a story about a group of newbie adventurers and how their bonds and experience grows until they are badass and save the world or something, then this is not for you. However if you are more into what reality would probably be like in that setting, then yes, it is. This story pulls no punches, and things go sideways right from EP1, in a very graphic way. SO buckle up, and hang on.",5
goblin-slayer,"Seeing these filthy GAAAAWBLINS get goblinated, for all their filthy GAWBLIN lies, is incredibly satisfying. The characters are hilarious as well, as you watch you'll meet: Spoiler Alert!

Please don't take this review seriously) I hope you enjoyed my review, now if you'll excuse I've gotten word that some filthy GAWBLINS are planning on goblinating the moon, and everyone knows that the only good goblin is a dead goblin, so I'm gonna go make those goblins good.

goblin-slayer,"Would like to leave a five star rating without commenting. Does this count? It`s about a guy who slays goblins, Violently and efficiently. Elsewhere is a huge conflict involving a demon lord and a hero who fights him to save the world: they get mentioned and get screen time for less than five minutes. Why? Because this show is about Goblin Slayer. Want to know why this show got five stars from me? Watch it.",5
goblin-slayer,"I cannot begin to say how much I love this series. It is not afraid to go as dark as it needs to show the plight faced by the denizens of the show's world. Some may say that it is senseless perversion, but this show made goblins honestly a terrifying force, not because of their destructive strength but by the depths of their depravity. Goblins are the go to monster mob of choice for so many fantasy works and they all feel like jobbers with no real substance other than they are ugly and kill people. GS has given them a reason to be called monsters and driving force behind us,as the audience, wanting to see them destroyed for the vile deeds. That aside the references to table top games and other fantasy works were a huge plus and fun to spot. I especially loved the LOTR references. The CG could be a little jarring but nothing terribly egregious. All in all I am excited for the OVA and then season 2 on from that, hopefully.",4
goblin-slayer,"With many viewers liking Goblin Slayer for not shying away from gore and having darker themes than the norm. I was encouraged to watch all the episodes except the recap episode which not only has a bogus summary but is completely pointless when there's only 2 episodes left. Though this story has potential by clinging to it's darker themes, no much of anything outside of committing acts of goblin genocide is interesting. With character interactions and memorable characters being mundane even when fantasy is it's niche, it's hard to keep watching til the end of each episode. I rate this a 3 mainly since there's still room to grow for the studio to have better direction with pacing (e.g. no more static moments such as the remainder of a supposed death scene being reflected from a birds eye for around 30 seconds), I'm not a fan of the story this anime is based on, there doesn't have be a harem to spice things up. Since it'll continue being wasted on a titular character that doesn't need one and no significant acts of romance has occurred yet, there's still a chance to put that effort towards giving more depth to these recurring characters that I could care less about because this story has no strong direction of emotional development towards anyone besides Goblin Slayer, the priestess, and the childhood friend. At this point there's not much to make the original story better, but the studio can still improve their presentation in further installments, lessening any awkward transitionings from scene to scene. This is a good show, but it became a far cry from its first episode as far as impressions go.",4.5
goblin-slayer,"Goblin Slayer season 1: 7.0/10 DC points (Dylan Crunch Points)Umm, wow! Goblin Slayer has some of the most heart racing fighting scenes I have ever seen. They do a great job at keeping the plot moving in unexpected ways. You will have no idea what is about to happen... even when you think you do. In the first few episodes, the main character can sometimes be hard to watch, as he really doesn't say much and is very stubborn. But you can't help fall in love with what he is trying to do and how he does it. The warning about the viewing content is not a joke. I never thought an anime could make me so uncomfortable, but a few scenes did. Still, you just cant look away. The creativeness in the characters movements and dramatic facial expressions make it everything!",4.5
goblin-slayer,"this is a well animated series to binge watch, but not made for small children! overall, I would watch this whole season again. it has a fitting last episode for the first season. this show sets up well for a season 2. if you are looking for a cute and fluffy anime, find something else. weapons, killing or bloody injuries, blunt scenes with violence towards women by goblins are included in this show.",5
goblin-slayer,"Goblin Slayer starts off really strongly, playing up the brutality of its universe, but after a few episodes it starts to feel less and less like the main characters are in danger and the same plot elements begin to repeat. By the end, there is no trace of the original darkness left. It ends like any generic fantasy anime.It's a real shame the show didn't play to its strengths, instead falling into a repeating pattern of Goblin Slayer finding goblins, killing them off with a flashy move he just happened to have prepared just in case for this particular kind of situation and having everyone sing his praises afterwards. The ending was so far from the show's dark premise that I felt like I was watching Log Horizon, a fantasy anime with polar opposite rules in its universe.",5
goblin-slayer,"I'm going to keep this  relatively  brief. The first season is average. It has some interesting ideas that might pan out in further seasons or the manga (which I might check out) but it didn't fully deliver on them. Once again, it might in the future, but as far as Season One is concerned the show sometimes feels a bit confused about where it wants to go or that it is holding back.Are we watching a journey of a man who MIGHT give in to his inner demons learning to open himself up to others and saving his 'humanity'? Maybe. But he starts the show with human connections and is already shown to be caring, in his way, to Cowgirl and strangers. Are we focusing on a band of heroes out to help 'the little guys', instead of seeking glory, by fighting goblins, an enemy looked down upon by 'true heroes' as not worth their time? Yes but the world building has some plot holes which hurts this a bit and leaves us with some head scratching moments. It is, however, exactly what the title says it is.I can see how people find it refreshing compared to recent anime trends, like people found Devilman Crybaby to be refreshing. Some episodes are great, Goblin Slayer isn't a bad character, most of the fights are fun and can even get creative, Lizard Priest is great, some of the fanservice can be a bit weird (I'm looking at you Sword Maiden during that spoiler scene), and other episodes range from ok to aggressively mediocre.It's average but your mileage will certainly vary. If you're just here to watch some goblins get wrecked, you'll probably have a fine time. I was just hoping to see more of some of the interesting ideas the show has to offer.",5
goblin-slayer,"Goblin Slayer is not for the weak. But if you can handle some gore and tense situations, and enjoy fantasy adventure stories, then this show will entertain you. Goblin Slayer is a knowledgeable adventurer who only accepts guild missions that involve annihilating goblins. He knows exactly what to do in every situation due to his experience, and his back story provides him with a passionate drive. He is accompanied by a good cast of party members and they go on some pretty exciting adventures. One of my favorite Fall 2018 shows.",4
goblin-slayer,"This anime has a darker tone than most but that doesn't mean that is all it has. The story is about as you guessed it an adventurer that slays goblins,  the story follows him on is daily life as an adventurer as well as give a glimpses of his dark past that tell you why he became this way.  the good balance between the action and his daily life as well as the interaction between his friends makes for an entertaining time.",5

goblin-slayer,"Let me sum up.  This series is NOT for everyone.  But it has a great basic DnD story line.  I love how there is this world changing event going on and the adventurers don't really seem to care about it.  Because Goblins.   It has tons of humor, violence and ridiculousness.  These make it so very watchable.  If it never gets a sequel, that's OK because it ends well.  If one does happen, I'll be first in line to stream it.  Not often I can say this about a modern anime.  Yes there is some disturbing rape in the first episode, but lets be realistic about this, it was to prove a point.  It wasn't just for show.  Other shows have done it for lesser reasons.  So if you can get past the first episode, I really do recommend it. But, you may want to censor it for younger/less mature or sensitive viewers.",5
goblin-slayer,"great first episode to pull the audience into the gruesome world this anime takes place in but rest of season can't fully recreate that feeling. throughout the season there is a looming evil that seems like the story can expand into, perhaps in a second season allowing growth for the characters but they end up uneventfully taking care of it with characters you aren't invested in leaving the end of the season with no real cliffhanger but also doesn't feel like the story is finished. still enjoyed watching very much though!",5
goblin-slayer,"Every once in a generation, there's that one person, song or show that people will talk about for years to come. You know of them, might even watch their videos, you've heard them and for the most part you might even agree with them. But at the same time, they can be controversial and do things you may not like from time to time. That doesn't mean you hate them. Or you should turn them off or ridicule them into oblivion. Embrace them. Get to know them. Understand why so many people you know adore them or hate them, Instead of waving them off forever.Goblin Slayer is that for anime. Rather than taking time to understand the intense message being conveyed on the screen, a minority decides they don't like one scene. Thus the rest of the project must inevitably be garbage. Nothing could be further from the case. Goblin Slayer is visceral. He is intense, to the point of zealous fanaticism. He is the Avatar of goblin death. And for a damn good reason. I won't spoil the show. Not here.  But suffice to say: it is the definition of ""Must Watch"".I have never been so sure of anything anime-related before. Not FMAB, Not Erased, or Death note. Nothing that has come before prepares you. And everything after must compare.Enjoy watching the greatest show on earth. I did thoroughly. And I waited until the end to write this. What a ride it's been. Sayonara until next time!",5
goblin-slayer,"*No Spoilers Review*Short Summary at EndWhen your character's vocabulary consists of ""Ah"", ""I see"" and ""Alright"" one would be hard pressed to find any significance of dialogue. This is where the studio practiced ""Less is More"" and proved that one or two words from a properly written main character can have far more emotional impact and character growth than a lengthy speech found in other animes.The protagonist, Goblin Slayer is a man who slays goblins. He's not a god, he's not a hero, he is a man that only knows one thing, that is how to slay goblins. His tactics, his gear, his knowledge and even his very identity all narrowly focus in on slaying goblins. He comes to town and simply asks for a quest that concerns slaying goblins. Hopefully by now you understand how much you'll end up seeing him slaying goblins.As the episodes fly by, you'll slowly start piecing together exactly why he's so obsessed. And the anime does this very well. Never revealing too much beyond what we can already guess, yet leaves some story on the fringes for us to guess at, but never goes into full detail, because, like Goblin Slayer, this anime has no time for exposition dumping. And this keeps the pacing of the anime exactly where it should be.The story is actually far better than I expected and you'll find yourself rooting for the aforementioned protagonist and his eventual group of fellow misfits and friends. The story gets dark at times, but also has some nice gritty humor to keep things from going over the edge. There's light-hearted moments and there's genuine heart-strings being pulled at times. It's weird, but this is one of the first times where I've watched an anime I've thoroughly enjoyed and *not* remembered any of the character's names and have not been bothered by this, I'd like to think that it's simply because the story is being told through the eyes of someone who doesn't care much about names, it doesn't detract from the story at all, in fact it actually is a relief that I don't have to memorize a billion and one character surnames. Through this review, you'll notice that I haven't mentioned the action, that's because it purely deserves it's own section, which we'll talk about now.Now, first off let me say, I've seen some people say it's far too embedded in realism and I guess that in their eyes it may be, but I can see why it needed to be. The combat, purely accentuates the fact that each of these characters, while being better, tougher or stronger than the average human, are not super-human. They have flaws, they have weaknesses, they cannot beat your heroes like Naruto or Alucard. They can easily die like you or me, and the best part is that the characters ""understand"" this. Goblin Slayer especially knows what he can and can't do... Though we'll touch on this later.So, combat in Goblin Slayer is gritty, realistic and very bloody within reason. The studio was not afraid of putting in some nudity and horrific deaths to bring their points across. Though, the combat is more thoughtful than most animes, as said before, Goblin Slayer *knows* what he's capable of, so he devises plans to get around these limitations. I will say that it's not Death Note level of mindgames here, but it goes without saying that with a one track mind and a hatred that is far more than mere obsession Goblin Slayer more than gets the job done, educating both his party and the audience of his world and why they should take heed.Though, with all thoughtfulness aside, the combat is quick, it's agile and it really is better than 9/10ths of anime out there fully in my own opinion. It's essentially the Dark Souls of anime, where death looms around every corridor and cave if one's not careful and it does the story justice, sticking around long enough to get some action, but leaving when plot needs to happen. Overall a pretty good balance.I'd rate the animation as a solid 8/10, not too shabby, though I expect the next season to rectify this. Speaking of, there are some parts that absolutely look stunning and will age very gracefully. There's some rare instances of 3D animation, though it's done mostly okay and doesn't distract from the presentation.Speaking for sound design, it's quite good, not a lot of stock sounds and the voices are clear and volumes are nicely done. The music on the other hand is beautiful and each track fits the anime quite nicely. I usually skip most intros to animes, I've never skipped a single one in Goblin Slayer. It's almost tribal hymns are quite different than what we usually hear and are ever-present through tougher and more dangerous scenes.Overall, I rate this a 8.5/10The story is great, not amazing though it's very well written.The animation is consistently good, though could be better.The characters are very well written, though need more backstory.Combat is quick and gruesome, though doesn't overstay it's welcome.Sound Design is above average.Music Design is excellent.If you want a great anime that delivers a simple premise of slaying goblins, while rooting for a great selection of characters and learning lore in the process. A show that doesn't pull punches yet still gives you light hearted moments and great character developments. Yet shows you the full capabilities of a strangely intelligent man that's obsessed with efficiently killing goblins, Goblin Slayer is a must watch.""The Imagination is a weapon. Those who don't use it die first."" - Goblin Slayer",5
goblin-slayer,"After watching Goblin Slayer i can say its not the best anime but its not the worst and sits comfortably at the top, i can see why this is so popular. i was positively surprised the dark and gritty scenes where well made. The story is not the best but far from bad, its hard to build up the world and characters with only 12 episodes, Witch is what keeps this from 5 stars.hopefully as the series proved popular the next season will have more episodes to expand upon",4.5
goblin-slayer,"Haven't read the LN, so I just thrown into it like most people. It started off in a way to set the tone for the rest of the series, which is good in my opinion. Loved most episodes and definitely the protagonist. Didn't dive into the harem category, which is great too. Still a little fan service but that didn't take away anything. Also the action was top notch! So if you like the first episode you will love it.",4.5
goblin-slayer,"The shock and scare factors hook people into this anime as it is pretty graphic and disturbing to some, however goblin slayer does not go over the top it sure has it's fair share of horror especially during the first episode that really got the viewers attention. As well as them doing a great job keeping goblin slayers face a secret which is one of the main reasons i kept watching. 9/10 overall exited for season 2",5
goblin-slayer,"This is my first review for any of the anime series I've watched. I have not really felt the need to write one before now, but this is just that good. I will make sure I don't spoil anything.While, at times, the animation can be less than perfect, it is barely noticeable when compared to any of the ""greats"" people regularly tout. The story starts out absolutely brutal, and for this reason, I would recommend no kids watch it. It then slows down a little bit, before building up to an incredible finale. The story-line is very well written, and watches like reading an epic. There are no annoyingly repeated catch phrases or cute (but worthless and again annoying) addon characters. Each character has his or her own depth and ties in with the story. Everything that happens either builds the characters, builds relationships, or builds the story. Based on what I saw, if this studio can keep making seasons like the first, or go even beyond what it has already, I think that this anime will become one of the greatest of all time.",5
goblin-slayer,"Goblin Slayer: not your average fantasy anime with a main character from another world or with a lot of comedy/harem element (like isekai or taking place within a game). Instead, this is a dark fantasy anime that sticks out with gore, violence, and brutal murder unlike most fantasy anime today.When the first episode came out, a lot of viewers were disturbed with the first episode as a lot of them watched it without having proper knowledge of what they should have expected. Kumo Kagyu, the author of the light novel series, wanted to make a story that stood out among any other fantasy anime today; thus coming up with Goblin Slayer (anime adaptation by White Fox).The anime starts off with The Priestess joining an adventurer guild after receiving her training with light and holy magic. She gets asked to join a small group of porcelain ranked (lowest level) adventurers to join her group to go kill some goblins in a cave, and so she accepts.Everyone in the group seems happy, very eager to complete their quest, and truly do believe that it will be easy for them to get the job done... but this isn't a romanticized fantasy anime and things don't turn out as well as they expect it would.The goblins made a sneak attack from behind. They overwhelm the adventurers one by one and everyone but The Priestess gets slain; one of the girls, The Fighter, gets raped (not shown but is suggested from clothes being ripped off and her screaming as a shot is shown away from her).Just when the goblins were about to gang up on The Priestess, a man in a full set of armor arrives and slays them all; hence being the ""Goblin Slayer"" as said in the title of the show. And so he goes out to fulfill the quests the adventurers have failed to complete along with The Priestess helping him out with the remaining goblins.He shows to have true understanding of goblin psychology while never hesitating for each kill made. After completing the quest, the priestess decides to join him as his adventuring companion.Goblin Slayer Opening https://youtu.be/0i0z98M2y5U Goblin Slayer | GOBLIN SLAYER https://youtu.be/bMnriO4UWVI So let's bring this question up: why have such a gruesome anime filled with horror and violence? Why not have it be a much less horrific anime like Konosuba, Sword Art Online, or even No Game No Life?In today's world, isekai and video-game-based anime are what's trending for authors and anime studios to make. Kumo Kagyu, on the other hand, wanted to reinvigorate horror fantasy anime once again as it used to be back in the old days of anime.Kagyu talks about this in his interview hosted by TheAnimeMan on YouTube where he goes over the making of Goblin Slayer as well as his journey as an author.​​Interview With ""Goblin Slayer"" Creator Kagyu Kumo https://youtu.be/0sN0p3xsorkHe also talks about why the characters don't have particular names but are labeled with who they are such as Goblin Slayer, Priestess, Guild Girl, etc. He wants the audience to decide on how to perceive these characters; basically granting them the ability to view them by personal perspectives.Going with the anime adaptation, this is very perfect for the first group of adventurers seen and killed. Even if we, the audience, learn their names, they would eventually be forgotten. Instead, we are shown a couple of times with flashbacks in black and white but having their eyes being colored (something to differentiate all of them that have died).Also with the nicknames comes to use for some of the characters being well known to certain peoples. A lot from other lands have heard of The Goblin Slayer's deeds in taking on quests in killing goblins. And so the elves know him as Olcborg, the dwarves as Beard-Cutter, and the lizard men as Sir Goblin Slayer.Request | GOBLIN SLAYER https://youtu.be/yIVHv0uY5qU It does also bring great in depth mystery for the protagonist as we do not know his name but rather what he does and his past as we get to learn more about him through each passing episode. From first impressions, we can tell that his daily life is eat, sleep, and killing goblins with an added touch of 3D animations from time to time to show of his inclination to daily duties.Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideA great example would be whenever he arrives at Cow Girl's place to eat, sleep, and rest, he always checks for tracks of goblins and any evidence left behind. Say if a fence got broken down a bit, then there were goblins lurking around (perhaps he has hidden care for Cow Girl to make sure she's not targeted; a thought to pass up).​​Daily Routine | GOBLIN SLAYER https://youtu.be/1ZcfSoaByr4 The only time we don't see him as a 3D animation is whenever he's having a close/intimate conversation with others. From those conversations, his appearance can easily level with the people he's talking with and be more than just somebody who's only desire is to kill goblins but be able to have more empathy towards him.​​Where do Goblins Come From? | GOBLIN SLAYER https://youtu.be/4rjufADdbW0 And from having more empathy for him, we begin to understand why he must feel to only kill goblins. Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideAfter all, he had a sister once and saw the horror unfold before his eyes as she was raped and brutally murdered.It's very reasonable as to why Goblin Slayer only kills goblins not only by this scarring past he has but how other adventurers haven't been taking on these quests. The higher ranking adventurers don't go for these quests as they seem too easy for them to do.Not only that, but the lower ranking adventurers can barely stand a chance against them; most likely die just like the first batch of adventurers. And so, I perceive him as a sort of an uncelebrated hero for solely slaying goblins where hardly anyone would be able or even want to take on these quests.I also do appreciate that Guild Girl is happy for Goblin Slayer bravely taking on those quests as she understands how critical it is to slay as much as possible with even women being taken captive, raped, and mentally scarred.",5
goblin-slayer,"It's visceral. Some might like it some might hate it, I love it. It's a good look at how a protagonist suffering from PTSD might function in a fantasy setting, something that seems to be overlooked way too much.Some parts of the manga which were cut - I wish they hadn't but, I can understand the desire to pave a smoother path for casual anime viewers.The story, plot, narrative and characters are fine and their development could be a tad better but, I think it's fine as presented.So, maybe it depends on what you are seeking or what your personal tastes are but, this is one of the few anime I look forward to watching this season and in fact, I'm hoping it gets another season, a full cour.",5
goblin-slayer,"Goblin Slayer is basically a really good anime, even if it has its flaws.First, there's one important point to consider. The Anime is based on the design and adaptation of Kōsuke Kurose who's the artist and designer for the manga version. He made those based on the input from the Light Novel author who is Kumo Kagyu. What this means is that this anime is an adaptation that followed another adaptation and that's why, compared to the source material and, especially, the manga (since it also have the visual part to it), the anime hit and miss on some major points. (This is also why, on some part, those who have read the LN or even the Manga has to explains things about the anime to those who haven't.)In both the LN and the Manga, the subject surrounding the facts that goblins are truly evil creatures because they are openly raping, killing and eating humans as the biggest scums possible are displayed in a crude and efficient way. You don't feel any kind of empathy or sadness for every one of the killed goblins. Instead, you might even feel happy/proud that they get killed. In this anime, the violence and aggressiveness of the goblins was toned down a lot and this makes them feel a lot weaker and innocent than from the LN and manga. That, by itself, makes some part awkward. (They are holding onto someone clothes and a few moment later, that someone's is almost fully naked with not much of a wound as if she took a bath or something.) This is why I consider the anime great, but still a failure toward the original material. Not because I would prefer to see open scene of rape, violence and brutality, but because those part are a necessity to display how critical things are. (For example, in the manga and LN, the guy who gets killed in the start, he get chopped into pieces and gets eaten in front of the other girls. In the anime, you don't see or know much of what's happening of him other than that he bleeds, die and disappear.)In the light novel, more or less, everything is well described. In the manga, while some details are removed (for the sake of having a great flow in the panels), it's efficient at putting emphases on the important part in the discussions between the characters which gives roots to the great story. The anime lacks that kind of preparation and, on top of having part being cut off (or disordered), it slightly fails at giving the right view of how things really are.It's kinda like if you were to watch a series about Vikings' raid and all you would see are clean viking foot-warrior slapping captured women they have captured. You could say that, in Goblin Slayer, goblins are like underground vikings with a taste for human meat. Still, the anime, by itself, is great. The soundtracks are good. The Animation are also good, even if some CGI could have been worked on a bit more. (We got to understand that this is how it's done now. Either they use CGI or we get 1 episode per month and the anime would be cut off mostly to OAVs format.)",5
goblin-slayer,"I`m going to keep it 100. I`ve been seeing some 1-3 star reviews saying its encouraging rape, that shouldn't be a reason you taint this anime with such low stars. this anime gives a splash of Fantasy and reality. If we lived in a 2D adventure theme world where we had to survive by defeating mobs and completing quest to keep the world safer shit like rape/thieving and malicious intent will happen. This anime gives the perfect reality to the anime that i like to feel in my heart not no OP main character where you know nothing bad will happen. fucked up peddy shit happens in this anime is why i like it its makes you feel like why tf was that person so fucking stupid to go do that",5

I love this anime and what makes me give this series its stars on this review is 1st Star for the characters Like the Elf girl <3 and Goblin Slayer as well as the surrounding adventures that you normally wouldn't get back story on in a adventure guild type anime. 2nd star is for the dark scenes and unexpected potential that i wasn't expecting when i first clicked on this anime.3rd star is for the story and background character surrounding Goblin Slayer the 4th star being the way they show the combat as in some fantasy anime's the whole battle would have a couple of spells or the character war crying and beating the enemy's with brute force Goblin slayers way of combat are more realistic and show how much time and thinking goes thru the developers heads when thinking about fighting goblins in a cave as for the rope tactic and Goblin slayer showing the rookie priest how they focused there attention to a totem instead of the cave walls that had another direction which led to her team being attacked and ;( raped   the fifth star is over all its a great show that keeps me interested and always hyped to see the next episode. I also post more anime ratings and reviews on my story on my instagram account @junkodashi,5
fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood,"This is probably one of the first anime shows I watched, and one of the few shows that I have re-watched more than once. It has everything that you could want in a show good story, enjoyable characters, and good music.FMA Brotherhood will have you laughing, crying, and everything in between while providing you with a memorable story that will last a lifetime. You will not regret watching this show.That being said I highly recommend you watch this show, even if you have to put off other shows in order to watch it.",5
fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood,"This one one of the few anime where I actually suggest watching the dub.The show is brilliant, the music is amazing, and the story is fantastic.Ideal Watching Guide:Watch ""Fullmetal Alchemist"" (the original)Wait a few monthsWatch ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood""While Brotherhood goes in a completely different direction, both works started with the same base, and the team behind Brotherhood assumes you've seen the original. This is why the original takes a little more time in the early years/training/qualification/story building stages (as they're establishing an entire world), while Brotherhood is able to build off what it already assumes viewers known and ""gets right into it"" a lot faster.The original FMA was really good, don't get me wrong, but Brotherhood is by far superior.. however, if you want to be able to enjoy both of them - watch the original first, otherwise it's like trying to read the book after watching the movie. It just takes the fun out of it, lol.Mild Spoiler Warning: Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideAlso, when watching FMA:B after having watched FMA, you'll be casually enjoying the first dozen or so episodes going ""yeah, this is similar, just trimmed a bit... I wonder when it'll start to - HOLY CRAP!!! That... er... um.. well, yeah.. that's one way to kill someone. I guess we've started with the new stuff 0.0",5
fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood,"Just another 5/5 star rating, but honestly this series deserves it. I have not seen a show go for 50+ episodes and stay so engaging in regards to its plot and animation. The characters are memorable and their struggle is really felt. The animation never dips and to me that says a lot, for I have seen the occasional slip up episode here in there in other shows. Highly recommend both the dub and sub for this one.",5
fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood,"This anime is simply one of the best shows I've ever seen. So the first thing I should clear up is that you must watch the dub. Nearly all of the English voices are spot on. Next, let's talk about story. I'll give you a brief summary without any spoilers. Edward and Alphonse Elric are two brothers whose father was an alchemist. Their father left them at a young age, leaving behind his family and research. The days went by as Ed and Al lived with their mother alone and played with the neighbor kid, Winry. They had a fondness towards alchemy, despite having bitter feelings towards their father. The boys poured over their fathers research, and with some talent and practice, were able to teach themselves to use the art. Eventually, a deadly illness comes, and with it takes many lives. One of these lives belonged to Ed and Al's mother. Heartbroken and desperate, the boys commit an unforgivable sin: they attempt to bring their mom back from the dead using alchemy. As the equivalent exchange for committing such heinous crime, Ed loses his right arm and left leg while Al loses his entire body. The boys spend the entirety of Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood searching for a philosopher's stone in order to use it to get their bodies back. There are many twists and turns throughout the story, which really work well and leave the viewers on the edges of their seats. The characters all work well together and really bring life to the show. This show is capable of bringing out all emotions from you. It is definitely worth a watch, I'd say.",5
fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood,"Art is something that evokes an emotional reaction, whether it be excitement, sadness, anger, or anything else. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood's incredible fight scenes make it easy to evoke excitement from fans, but what truly sets it apart is it's ability to evoke such a powerful emotional response on a deeper level at the same time. This story resonates with people on a primordial level through the love and bonds between family. It's an incredible roller coaster ride of action, love, and despair.FMA: Brotherhood will change the way you think about anime.",5
fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood,"Fullmetal Alchemist brotherhood is one of my favorite anime series to date, and will always will be. I have rewatched this at least 7 times and even went on to buy my very first anime blueray.I'm first going to shortly state why I think brotherhood is better than the previous animated series of Fullmetal Alchemist. The first series had a rather unsatisfactory ending, and when put side by side to the ending of brotherhood, it shouldn't even be comapred. Brotherhood has some of the same concepts or events that occur in the original series, but with both branching off into its own main story line and endings. For me, the storyline for brotherhood is extremely enriching, and even more so when approaching the final to this series. The conclusion to Brotherhood is one of the best I've ever seen, and is one of the reasons I continue to rewatch this anime multiple times. The amount of emotions Brotherhood takes you through is absolutely insane, yet wonderful at the same time. Every single character seems meaningful to both the story and how it impacts the main characters, while having great character development. The character development makes you emotionally attached to every single character that is in the anime and you won't forget a single one. I also love the physical growth of the characters throughout the timeframe of the anime, which is paced excellently to show their maturation. This anime is great for anyone, and will be enjoyable to all those who watch it, and become one of your favorites as it became mine.There are only a few issues I have with this series, mainly the attempts to be humorous which almost all viewers of fullmetal alchemist agree is overboard. Besides this, I personally don't like the introduction and would have preferred a setting starting their early lives, but besides that the journey these characters go through together is just amazing.I watched the sub at first, which was years ago and I cannot recall, but most of my rewatches I watched dub and it was great. This is a journey between two brothers who will grow not only together, but along with you as make you feel the same emotions they feel and the same regrets have. Enjoy.",5
fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood,"Two of my greatest pet peeves when it comes to shows is 1. Inconsistent characters and 2. Dragging on the plot unnecessarily. This show does neither of those. The whole plot is extremely well thought out with close attention to detail. There are no plot holes and every event that is shown is necessary to the overall theme of the show. They don't drag it out or add in dumb fillers to make the show longer than it needs to be. All of the characters are three dimensional and well written, as well as not doing things that seem too far out of character for them. Overall my favorite show.",5
fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood,"This is my favorite anime. I don't want to sound bias but... This anime is so well written. *applause* My boyfriend first watched this anime by himself and I didn't give two cents about it. The art didn't catch my eyes. I know... stupid me. I finally got around to watching it and every episode was a rideee. It's funny, eventful, emotional, touching, loving, and... what else do they say when a film wins an oscar. It's just AMAZING.Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hide I was balling my eyes out when Hohenheim went to his wife's grave to apologize. Snots and boogers EVERYWHERE. Just watch it. It really is, wonderful.",5
fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood,"(I’m speaking for both Brotherhood and 2003) I don't even know where to begin with this one; there are so many positive things to say about it that I wouldn't be afraid to even say it's flawless. It has some of the best character development and really connects you to the characters emotionally. It’s almost impossible to hate any character in this show, even the villains (speaking of which, some of the villains are my favorite characters) and the protagonists are memorable and in a sense, relatable. Their struggle throughout the show keeps you thoroughly engaged and excited to see what happens next. This show has everything you would want in a good series and keeps you hooked for every episode. Its action scenes are not to be missed and the animation for the fight scenes is so fun to watch. The emotional impact of this show is substantial and the lessons it teaches about love and sacrifice really speak to the heart. The story progresses while keeping the same end goal consistent throughout the whole series without diverting away from the characters’ objectives. The action and adventure is thrilling and prevents you from looking away. The soundtrack is memorable, characters are sensational, story is remarkable, and animation is clean and smooth. You can zip right through this anime without even realizing it, that’s how enjoyable it is. Also, never have I come across a more original story than this one; the plot is so unique that you have to give kudos to the creator. This is, in my opinion, the best anime; it is everything that an anime should strive to be and more. It’s fun, surprising, exciting, heartfelt, hilarious, and heart wrenching to say the least. This anime has set an unreachable bar for others, proudly claiming its spot at the top. Not an anime fan? Watch it anyway; it’s worth your time- if you haven’t watched this anime, then you’re really missing out.",5
fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood,"I used to not like anime. At all. I thought it was the silliest shit ever. I saw people buying these huge pillows and figures all dedicated to anime and I never got it (to some degree I still don't get it). But then I was recommended FMA and FMA Brotherhood on Netflix and I decided 'what the heck' why not give it an episode. Within 5 days I watched everything. FMA and Brotherhood (in this case Crunchyroll only has Brotherhood but this applies to both) the series taught me about what an anime can bring to the table as a serious medium to convey a serious story with plenty of great themes. It's been 2 years and I go for a rewatch of it every single year. In short watch this, if you haven't already, you're in for a ride.",5
fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood,"Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is an anime that looks appealing to the eye right when you start watching it. This anime shows the bond between siblings as they go through hardships and hurt. These brothers stick by each others side no matter what. They've never really doubted each other. After losing their mother they try there best to get her back, but that ended up as a disaster. They confided in each other for help. Also there are a lot of really cute relationships, that is so hard not to ship. And you'll fall in love with every character. It's also very action packed and very funny at times. Especially when someone comments about Ed's height or them wanting him to drink milk. It's so full of emotion. I will have to say I've cried and laughed and screamed while watching it. These characters have left a large mark on my heart and I'll never forget them. I was devastated when it ended. I'll watch it over and over and never get tired of this anime masterpiece.  This anime deserves more than a 5 star.",5
fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood,"Everyone who watches anime will at least have seen this once. The reason being that the plot is so unique, and hits close to home. It may seem fast-paced at first simply because this was basically a patch to a poorly ended ""Full Metal Alchemist"". The differences between the endings is not even comparable. This show makes you laugh, cry, make you angry, and make you think about what it means to be a person. Highly recommend.",5
fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood,"i liked it, its ending was nice and satisfying for a 64 episode show i might have a couple grievances but its all well and good. the thing i disliked was that (extreme spoilers literally last episode stuff) Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hidethat edward didnt accept the stone to bring back his brother instead getting rid of all alchemy in his life, sure the promise and so on but even mustang accepted it only edward didnt want it anyways good show",5
fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood,"Before I write my review I just gotta say...WATCH IT, JUST DO ITThat out of the way, let us continue...I watched this spectacular anime a year or so ago. It was one of those experiences where you wish to forgot about just so you can go back and watch it all over again with no prior knowledge. I cannot stress enough how good this show is. Here's just a few reasons why it's amazing:- Deep, unique and loveable characters.- An intricate and interesting plot that keeps you entertained and curious. - Considering it has over 60 episodes, the animation is beautiful, especially when it amps up (then you're in for a treat).- Stunning OST's (I love the music so much).- 5 Absolutely Killer Openings (If you obsess over openings like I do you will love FMAB's).- So many memorable moments. Happy, Sad, Epic, etc. It has em all.- I personally love the themes this show explores, many philosophical and ethical themes shown. To me this creates an experience you can't find very often.- It has so much to it, it has the action, the emotional moments, the cliffhangers, the head-scratchers, the jaw to the floor moments, and so on. Put simply, MANY AMAZING MOMENTS.I could go on for so much longer (if I did I might end up spoiling things so I will stop here while I can xD). It is my favourite anime so of course I have a bias, I will definitely admit that, but it's my No.1 for a reason. Even if you are just slightly interested I would suggest giving it a go, you will not regret it. Well, I guess that's my review. I really hope this helps you decide to watch this marvellous show.Sincerely, An Anime Weeb Who Is Slightly Obsessed With FMAB :)",5
fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood,"The story and characters are all amazing, even though this is said to be the best anime of all time. I simply have to agree the plot of the main story is very interesting a few kids learn alchemy to save there dead mother, which you will learn later on what they had made, I will not say just to avoid spoilers. Great story and the characters are well developed unlike most of the anime now. My rating would be a solid 10 and probably won't change.",5
fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood,"I remember watching the original show back in the day and wondering what happened when it kind of just stopped. It had become a mess and things weren't really making sense. Of course the reason is the original source material wasn't finished so the showrunners were just kind of winging it.  Then, THEN, Brotherhood happened. Everything is great, the show looks good, the story lines are varied and interesting, and the show takes time to be serious and lighthearted. Oh and the show isn't a damn mess! The source material is done, so the show knew what to do and when to do it the entire time, and It's pretty badass! Check it out!",5
fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood,"I used this show to get my older sister started on anime. She hasn't looked back since :)Characters and story are exceptionally well-developed, and why I recommend this show to just about anyone who hasn't seen it. Romance (what little there is, and that's not a bad thing) is also very believable, and sometimes quite subtle.Animation is very good.Overall near perfect, though the beginning of this remake of the original feels a little rushed. Other than that, it's a great entry for others into anime, simply because it's the cream of the cream. One of the best.",5
fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood,"If you haven't seen this series yet, you're missing out. A defining series in the genre, these two brothers will take you on an epic journey that is full of drama, action and some pretty dark times.The bad guys are bad. The good guys are good...but the lines that separate the two are sometimes blurred, which adds to the drama. The action is great. The story is well written. The character development is strong. And the animation is strong. If you haven't seen this series yet, you should really add it to your queue and prepare to binge watch like there's no tomorrow.",5
fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood,"Every episode is full of purpose. Every character leaves a lasting impression. The humor is witty, the drama is sharp, the action is frantic and forceful. Filler isn't a word ever found in a single minute of the show's 64 episode run time. Every moment seems to be put there for a reason, and you will be hard pressed to find a show that can do as much as Fullmetal Alchemist can do in 64. It leaves you wanting more, but satisfies you with a complete, well rounded tale. It'll make you laugh, cry, gasp, cheer.You don't need anymore proof than this small paragraph. Go watch it",5
fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood,"There's a good reason so many people consider this the absolute zenith of anime--and no, that reason is not faithfulness to the source material. Seriously, if that was a valid criterion, there'd be no art in the world at all, just a bunch of endlessly repeated knock-offs of bacteria, viruses, and other microbes. No, that reason is simply ""it's just that magnificent a work of art."" The story twists and turns as necessary but keeps the end goal consistent; the cast is massive and colorful and each of the characters have unique quirks, levels of depth, and niches all over the moral and emotional spectra; the action keeps you riveted from start to finish; and the jokes are so well timed and paced that they seem to never get old. Plus, the music and animation are crisp, clean, fluid, and simply spectacular.Bottom line: if you're only going to watch one anime in your lifetime, let this be it.",5
fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood,"Fma Brotherhood is a amazing series. It was one of the animes that got the newer generation into our anime world. Its got a amazing heartfelt story that follows the Elric brothers as they search for a way to get there bodys back..  Now im gonna out right say this the original series i hate. Yes its good but it ruined  by a bad lack luster ending.  See The manga writer, Hiromu Arakawa,  was working on the manga while the original series was also being released. However bout halfway through the anime they got ahead instead of just waiting for the manga to get caught up they decided to make stuff up and completely change the series. So it was a complete shock when fma brotherhood was released but then it was stated that it would follow manga and i was skeptical but as i watched it i was shocked. The Animation is top quality and theres always something moving and flowing. The music  is amazing and will get stuck in your head long after the episode ends. anyway im gonna stop gushing on how amazing this anime is and just tell you... GO WATCH IT!!!!!",5
fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood,"FullMetal Alchemist Brotherhood.Its hard to be fair in a review for an anime with so much to it. I feel a need to post a review, but at the same time you just can't be fair to such a great anime without spoiling it all. A few things about it: Its quite long. Completely original. No fillers. Great characters. Great story. Memorable music. Great OPs. Moments of goosebump epicness.Its one of the few animes I own hardcopies of because its also rewatchable.Its an adventure. It has everything one can ask for as the anime covers all the bases at one point or another. It doesn't limit itself to one term or genre.Whats more to say? Go try it. Go watch it. Its one of the greatest animes of all time for a reason. That reason being it is really damn good from the start and only gets better by the finish.",5
fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood,"Only trying to help solidify the 5 starness of FMA Brotherhood. Whether this is the anime that got you hooked on anime or whether you fell in love with it early on in your anime career, this is one of very few MUST watch animes. For a while I thought Death Note and Code Geass were the must watch animes, but then I watched FMA Brotherhood. This show needs no reviews. Alchemy, drama, action, plot, and everything you want out of a show is packed into this perfect series.",5
fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood,"I love everything about this anime. It is everything an anime should strive to be and more. It is heartfelt, hilarious, and heart-wrenching. The action is amazing. I loved the original, too, but the ending kind of ruined it for me. This, on the other hand, leaves no loose ends, and I could not ask for a better ending. A satisfying ending is a surprisingly hard thing to find in most anime, but this one does it perfectly. If you have yet to experience this masterpiece, then strap in and prepare for an unforgettable journey.",5
fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood,"Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood does something very great in it's anime and it's pacing of the story, building relationships between the characters, art style but the biggest one imo is that no one ever feels useless in the series and that to me is quite amazing! So far I'm almost finished with the series and man it's reputation does hold up and I'm very impressed. I also feel like I can rewatch this series because it is that good and I do love this show! Colonel Mustang is my favorite.",5
fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood,"This is easily one of the greatest anime I’ve seen. Everything about it - the characters, the worldbuilding, the themes, the magic system - is all carefully coordinated and structured together to make a thrilling, visceral story. It serves as a perfect example of how combining standard anime tropes with traditional Aristotalian storytelling produces a deep, complex, and extraordinarily entertaining work of art. I can’t recommend this anime highly enough.Plot: 5/5The plot moves forward in a consistent, engaging way that makes full use of all the characters in the story, intertwining their individual and collective arcs together in an elegant and creative manner. I frequently find myself disappointed when it comes to endings in anime, but this was far from the case with FMA; the ending resolved every plot point, character arc, and thematic development in a concise and satisfying way.Characters: 5/5Every character in this story felt unique and integral to the plot. They all had powerful motivations which compelled them to action, making the circumstances move forward in a dynamic and exciting way. I was especially impressed with the character development on the sides of both the heroes and the villains. Edward and Alphonse's change in perspective on objective truth and scientific dogma was handled extremely well, as well as the redemptive arcs of previous villains like Greed and Scar. Conflict: 5/5Since each character had such a clear and pervasive motivation, the conflict that arose between them felt natural in it’s instigation and development. For a show that is often very deep and philosophical, it also had extremely stunning fight scenes. The creation of Alchemy on Arakawa’s part was pure genius, as it enabled a wide variety of creative battles, all while retaining the integrity of a magic system that is so hard in it’s rules, restrictions, and costs that it can almost be considered science-fiction.Setting: 5/5The amount of detail that went into the world building of the FMA universe is beyond impressive. Arakawa clearly did her research, and it is expressed in the early-industrial German aesthetics which were incorporated seamlessly into the vivid world she created. The attention to detail regarding history, religion, climate, topography, and mythology is simply fascinating. This was evident in how other cultures interacted with Amestris, like when Lin, Foo, and Lan Fan emigrated there from Xing, and the civil war flashback with Ishval.Themes: 5/5Probably the greatest part of this series are the themes and philosophies present all throughout the narrative. Starting with the simple question of “what is the human soul?”, the story evolved into a complex and in-depth exploration of faith, scientism, nationalism, and human value. The concept of a human soul being reduced to a scientific element which can be extracted and weaponized is a truly inspired and original idea, which was fleshed out and explored in so many unique ways.",5
fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood,"Let me just say, there is not a single thing that I would change about this anime if I could. The plot is amazing with a truly compelling story and characters who you really sympathize with. The animation is great and the voice acting in both English and Japanese are amazing. In fact this is one of the few anime I would recommend watching dubbed. Naruto got me into anime so it gets my number 1 spot, but FMAB is a really close second.",5
fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood,"Honestly, one of the best anime out there. They don't destroy the content of the show with fan service, the plot is great, the pacing is great, the action is great, the relationships are great, it's all great. It will leave you pondering and feeling things you normally wouldn't in an anime. Just a stellar example of what the anime community should use as it's gold standard for a good quality animated series. It's is absolutely a must watch.",5
fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood,"I've personally watched a lot of anime (around 80+ Anime).But out of all those 80+ animes, Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood holds my personal title of #1. (Although Attack on Titan might change that????).FMA Brotherhood is similar to that of ATLA, many episodes with the protagonist and other characters all develop as the story slowly progresses, then finally ends in a beautifully written showdown with the main antagonist. All to that just make you take a step back and admire how far the characters have gone.I cannot stress how good this anime is when you watch it for the first time.But I believe that once you've watched this anime you MUST understand it, it is easy for one to glance over the deeper meanings and themes after the first watch. But once you understand what makes the characters tick and the symbolism of the show, it will blow your mind! Overall FMAB is a 10/10, must watch and a MUST TO UNDERSTAND in order to really enjoy it. The main theme to understand: the relationship between science and religion.",5
fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood,"A broken family; A burnt down home; a brother without flesh, and blood to call his own an older brother to follow, and chase to reclaim his brothers face! so our story begins dark, and only gets more intense as they search for the philosopher stone, which is full of blood, and sorrow literally, and furthermore it's a story full of brotherly bonds, and a dark twisted government secret that only Edward, and Al can bring to light to save the world from a greater evil! Full of action, adventure, comedy, drama, and tad touch of romance the show has it all! Take it from me who has seen it 7 times!",5

My favorite characters ever, my favorite themes ever, one of my favorite plots ever, the list continues. This is my favorite anime  ever . period. end of story. Seriously, this show is that good. It's laugh out loud funny when it can be, but sob your heart out sad at times. This show really is a roller-coaster of emotions and I cannot recommend it enough. If you are even slightly thinking about watching this show then watch it. If you aren't then start thinking about it. It really is amazing.",5
fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood,"Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is an amazing show that is extremely entertaining and engaging throughout the entire show. Be warned though, Brotherhood expects you to have watched the original Fullmetal Alchemist first. You can watch this show without watching the original but you will be missing out on a few details. This show came out after the manga was finished the original ended up getting ahead of the manga and branches off into its own story. Though the two shows have different endings the first few episodes are extremely similar. Since  Brotherhood came out years after the original finished most people who were ready for Brotherhood had already watched the original in its entirety. Because of this Brotherhood leaves out details or entire sub plots because it doesn’t want to repeat itself when it’s unnecessary or unrelated. One example of a plot left out is when Ed liberated the coal town which brotherhood briefly explains in about a 30 second segment. They expected the people who were watching Brotherhood to have already seen the coal town plot in the original and didn’t want to waste an entire episode on the plot which was already known. Regardless of this I still think this anime is amazing especially if you have watched the original beforehand. Both anime in my eyes are great and it’s very interesting to look at the similarities and differences between the two. In my eyes Brotherhood is the better anime. Some people talk about how both anime have their flaws and I agree that they do, but to me that’s only if you don’t watch both of them. Since both are completed shows it’s best if you binge watch both of them one after the other, so that you don’t have to worry about missing some details are forgetting things in between if you take a break between the two. In conclusion I would watch the original Fullmetal Alchemist first and then come to Brotherhood, but if you only want to take the time for one then Brotherhood is the way to go.",5
fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood,"I watched this show for the first time in 2013. Other than some random episodes of various shows that I'd caught on TV but never paid attention to, this was the first time I'd ever seen an anime.Oh my god. It was a literal life-changing experience.This show is one of the greatest achievements of storytelling I've ever encountered. The characters are real - genuine, emotional, flawed in unique ways, and deeply compelling. The story is incredible, and will amaze you with the scale of its ambition. There's also a streak of deep philosophy that runs through every arc in the show that really lends a sense of gravity to the decisions that are made. I've watched dozens of shows since I first saw FMA Brotherhood. I've enjoyed many of them, but this show is still in a tier of its own for me. I've watched it probably a half dozen times, and every time just reinforces that this is the best anime I've ever seen. I keep looking for new anime because I hope that I'll find something that's as good or better, but I don't think such a show exists yet. If you haven't watched it, drop everything and start right now. You won't regret it.",5

Surpurb storytelling, Beautiful, thoughtful and immensely detailed characters create a world that sucks you into it without trying and has you at the edge of your seat for every battle. It is an emotional rollercoaster as you follow these young men in their quest to get their bodies back and rectify their mistakes of the past.

With the exception of Steins;Gate, not many other  will gently, and violently when needed, pull the strings of your heart the same way this will. It will break you down when you're excited, and build you up when you're broken. Then in the end you too will realize one truth: Nothing else will EVER compare.",5
fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood,"I really enjoyed this series. It touched on some interesting philosophical themes like God, what is truth, alchemist rules, nature vs. nurture, man vs self, if killing is the right thing to do, and etc. I also enjoyed how side characters had dreams and goals that contribute to the overarching theme in FMA: Brotherhood. Roy Mustang (one of the awesome characters) wanted to change the government from a very military-dominant one to a more democratic one. Not to spoil too much, but it was an enjoyable series overall.",5
fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood,"My favorite anime of all time and has been since I first started watching anime when I was just a wee thirteen-year-old lass. Honestly one of the best anime ever made and one of the best English dubs of all time, in my opinion. Well-written story, amazing characters, intense fight scenes, a bit of comedy here and there, and some drama as well, what more could you ask for?Wholeheartedly Recommend to just about anyone, especially if you're new to anime and don't know where to start.",5
fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood,"Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood stands out as one of the best-crafted series I have ever seen. Everything about the show is brilliantly balanced, leaving the viewer utterly satisfied when they finish, and completely hooked until they reach the end. The story maintains a delicate balance of somber, dark, and serious, while still maintaining a charming heart, endearing characters, and the perfect dose of random humor. The story itself is extremely well executed, with basically no episodes being spent as ""filler"", and early episodes coming back, again and again, to impact the characters and drive their growth. One of the most stunning aspects of FMAB is the careful attention given to nearly every major character when it comes to their growth in the story. Though the major arcs focus on the brothers Ed and Al, less prominent characters get stunning moments in the spotlight. It is an incredible feat of story writing, well-paced action, a gorgeous score, and characters that will make you stand and cheer or quietly weep...This is a show that everyone should watch. It truly is one of the best stories I've seen.",5

Their quest pushes them forward to look for a mythical relic, the philosopher's stone.Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, does everything and anything you can think of right, any issues with the anime are going to come down to personal tastes or wish fulfillment. This is one for the history books, and one you won't regret adding to your library, even if your like me and it isn't one of your personal favorite anime, it is still worth the watch for anyone who wishes to see the best that anime has to offer.",5

The plot was beautifully done, The characters were original, and The endless amounts of beautiful opening and ending themes were consistent. 99.95% of anime don't even come close to this masterpiece, this work of art! Dragon Ball Z, Fullmetal Alchemist, and Deathnote are at the top for a reason and That is cause they have some of the best fanbases while having the credibility of being as good as people say it is. Which is why I rate this anime a 5 out of 5 *s",5
fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood,"When I think of classic anime series, Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is one of the first that comes to mind. Although not as long as other famous anime such as One Piece, Naruto, Dragon Ball, and Bleach, it holds up just as well if not better than the anime previously mentioned. It remains faithful to its source pretty much to a tee and is a series that will be just as good ten to fifteen years down the road as it was eight years ago when it first aired.",5

I this my favorite anime because of how well-written this was, though, the exposition could've been better executed. Overall, this is the starter anime for all those new to anime. It has action, romance (not to the point where you get annoyed), a well-thought story, good voice actors, characters that you root for, characters that you hate. FMAB get's straight into it, no cushioning.",5
fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood,This anime is by far one of the best I have ever watched it was great from the very beginning and never had an episode where I felt bored. The plot grew and strengthened itself with every episode and every major event that happened had me trying to guess what would happen next but always being amazed at the events that would transpire. The characters themselves all added to the story as well with everyone playing a part and never being forgotten through the massive story development every character had. The ending as well fits perfectly with the whole story and tied it all in at the very in to wrap up one of the most amazing adventures ive ever watched. Overall the attention to detail and the amazing story is what makes this anime an easy 5/5 for me.,5
fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood,"Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is a top tier Action/Adventure anime, a must watch for any anime fan of the genre. I've seen a lot of action/adventure anime, and FMAB is one of the best that I have seen.

I'm not going into any deep detail for this review because the show speaks for itself. If you watch it, you will not be disappointed.",5

The characters are well developed and you really get a sense of wanting the Elric brothers to find their peace. This show also has some of the best antagonists I've ever seen in an anime. I enjoyed every aspect of this show and it will leave you laughing, crying, and everything in between as you follow the Elric brothers through their journey.",5
fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood,"This is probably the one anime that I would recommend to people regardless of their age, gender, ethnicity or social status.  This isn't just an anime, it's entertainment.  I don't think I've ever seen such a complex storyline woven so intricately over time to have all of its loose ends tied up so cleanly.  I'm talking about television shows, movies, books, etc.  Little things that appear here and there early on and in the middle stages set up perfectly the rising action and the climax, resolved very satisfyingly in the denouement and resolution.I would actually show this to my friends or parents, and if they didn't like it, instead of being embarassed I would be dumfounded.  There are few cringey anime tropes, fanservice is few and far in between, and the focus is the unraveling of a genius web of storytelling.  This should be a classic that everyone in the world should watch.  I've only watched a few animes, but if there's an anime out there that could gain the respect of those who make fun of anime *cough* it's this one.I'm just so impressed.P.S. I almost forgot to say how amazing the soundtracks in this anime are.  Like holy **** some of them give me goosebumps.",5
fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood,"I was so impressed by this show. The first few episodes give plenty of background and set up the characters as likeable, but with their flaws and back stories. Then we have this big mystery that unfolds slowly, and it ends with what was admittedly a very drawn-out final battle. I was really and truly shocked by the ending, and so interested in seeing more of Ed and Al's adventures that I went back and watched the 2003 FMA. I am SO glad that I watched this one first (and used up all my data for that month doing it...) If you're choosing between them, start with the first 15 or so episodes of 2003's FMA, which explains the confusing plot holes in the early episodes of FMAB, since they kind of compressed those adventures for the latter series. (In particular, Yoki isn't even mentioned until halfway through FMAB, and then you ask who the heck he is if you haven't seen the 2003 series...) Then watch FMAB (all of it) and don't go back to the other one, because this one is so superior from that point onwards. I wound up watching it for the second time less than a year later (and I hardly ever rewatch shows), because I had enjoyed it so much originally (and I was waiting for new Case Closed episodes, LOL).Overall, this show has everything you could want: adventure, action, romance, and even a moral struggle (a deeper theme not present in many anime, or at least the ones I've seen). I find it similar in some ways to InuYasha - an overarching journey that eventually leads to some really tough choices, and an incredibly powerful ""stone"" that is the object being sought out. But this show is shorter and deeper, and definitely worth watching, especially if you've seen the 2003 series and were unsatisfied with the ending.EDIT: I totally forgot to mention how much I love the music! Especially the first and the third or fourth (the one that starts with their fingers tracing out a circle on the ground) openings.",5
fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood,"Fantastic show with lots of great writing, outstanding characters, and awesome animation, all supported by a wonderfully expressive Japanese cast. (I won't speak for the dub since it's a sort of love it or hate it sort of thing, and let's just say I was not on the ""love it"" side! I found it a little ridiculous and it almost made me laugh a few times, even when I wasn't supposed to be laughing...) Lots of emotion, which I love, and also tons of amazing action.

This one is more condensed and gets to the point quicker. If you're looking for a weekend binge, I'd recommend this one. It's got heart, soul, and the body to hold it altogether. It also has a lot of action without being overly gore-y. This is an anime all ages will appreciate because of the underlying themes and fast-moving plot. You'll laugh, you'll cry, and you'll be happy you saw this all time great.",5
fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood,"I'll keep it short and sweet: Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is the best anime of all time. I know superlatives like that probably will deter some from watching it or judging it as such, but in my opinion it's just the total package. It has stellar character development, not just for the central 2 or 3 characters but from the supporting cast as well as the villains. It has a plot that hooks you from the start and continues to evolve through 64 episodes, with great pacing. It has a setting that was clearly created with great detail and intricacy, and that serves as the perfect backdrop to the story. It has themes that manifest beautifully in the characters and that can be tracked throughout the entire series. It's also the only anime that I actually prefer the english dub to subtitles. Unlike the 2003 adaptation of Fullmetal Alchemist, FMAB follows the manga religiously (save for the first episode, which is an entertaining way to start the series and works as a great introduction to the world but still is technically filler). Just... do yourself a favor and watch the first 3 or 4 episodes. If you've already seen it, watch it again.",5
fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood,"I'm not going to leave a long, in-depth review, since others have done so and said anything I could better, but I will say this:I hate this genre of anime, this quasi-fantasy-setting-with-superpowers-because-superpowers-let-us-fight-more-better kind of crap, but I thoroughly love this show because the characters and septicemic are all very, very well written and every moment feels meaningful.Could reel that awful grunt-and-gasping back a bit, but that's also a universal complaint. Still, this show has a few too many shocked reaction shots, the kind where time stops long enough for the character to twitch and go 'ge-heh' like no human ever has in real life, ever, in the entire history of man...That is all!",5
fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood,"I fully recommend this anime to anyone, young or old. It is without a doubt a captivating tale that will keep you enthralled and constantly wanting more. It is a roller coaster ride of emotion that will keep you pinned in your seat, with its insurmountable highs and its heart shattering lows. Once you reach the end, you will fully understand, and walk away with something that will stay fondly in your memory. Give it a shot! You won't regret it.",5
fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood,"I'm serious if you havent seen it... why not? Binge watch it this weekend or better yet just watch it right now! It just has everything there great action, drama, comedy, and will have you crying like baby in no time. Oh and if your wondering if you should watch this one or the normal fullmetal alchemist well Brotherhood is just better. It has a way darker tone then the other one. It is closer to the manga too if I remember it correctly.",5
fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood,"Everyone has an anime they started which got them into anime itself, for me it was Naruto however I wish it was this one. This is probably one of the best anime whether it be a gateway anime or something you watch later in your life. The story, the art, the characters are just amazingly well done. This is one of the few anime where dub is also great, I have seen the original FMA and of course that one was alright while this is just pure epic. Although you should watch the original FMA you don't truly need to. If you just watch this you should be able to figure out the idea and story itself for the most case.To top it all off Winry is best girl.",5

I'd only heard of If It's for My Daughter, I'd Even Defeat a Demon Lord as a light novel series, so I'm incredibly happy to be able to watch and enjoy this beautiful story (although I do wish the animation itself were better).  Dale, a young (just 18!) adventurer, is finishing up a job when he finds a small demon girl in the forest.  Unwilling to leave a child in such straights, he brings her back into town with him and eventually accepts the challenge of instant fatherhood--lucky for him that he has some good, supportive friends in the married couple from whom he rents his room!  (Maybe even luckier for the young demon Latina!)  Dale is a loving and dedicated (if sometimes clueless) parent, but his and Latina's newly made family remains under some shadow: who was the dead demon with whom she had previously traveled?  And why was one of her horns broken off (a sign of punishment or of being made outcast amongst demons)?  But don't worry--in fact, rest assured that before Latina's past can even try to catch up to her, her ad hoc human family will ferociously protect her.  Like 2016's Sweetness and Lightning, this show is a love letter to familial love and to those who celebrate it; also like that anime, so let yourself be swept away.",4

The Buddah said the root of all suffering is attachment, if you need an excuse. Of course, if you enjoy stuff like Eromanga sensei because of just how hilarious it is to watch how degenerate humans can get, you will probably also enjoy this as it gets further into the plot. I think I will probably keep watching,  but well see if it becomes a dumpster fire as big and enjoyable to watch as Eromanga sensei or Domestic Girlfriend(the really really REALLY spicy one) or All You Need Is a Little Sister or Oremio or whether or not it's just a small trashcan on fire that's not enjoyable to watch. Also, if you dont mind this direction, I can highly recommend you watch Domestic Girlfriend,  the level of spice is astronomical,  its beyond what can logically be conceived by the human mind, on an entirely new dimension of ecchi spice, and it hilarious to think about what you just watched after every episode and just how ridiculous it is.

She says she has never once seen him as a father figure and it will be something Dale kind of has to take his time to really accept since obviously he has seen himself as a father figure to her most of her life.  However, he does come to accept her feelings and they get married.  So, for anyone who wanted to know that answer, there you go.  If you can watch this with the mindset of she NEVER saw him as a father figure and not be weirded out then it is a cute anime of a girl meeting this nice guy. Seriously, going on JUST the anime alone and not knowing the end game to this the girl is cute.  The characters are pretty funny, though Dale can get annoying at times with how much he obsesses over her when he isn't by her side instead of like..focusing on his missions and stuff.  It has its funny cute moments. The arts nice, just before you get fully invested have the spoiler in mind. If not you're going to be in for a shock and it might ruin things for you.  It might not, you might have seen it coming (like i did) because I do think there were hints.  Though the title is misleading...

I am also just giving it three stars because before I found out how this would all go down I was enjoying the anime, but knowing the ending makes me dissapointed and made me have to drop this.  I am not going to give this a one star however just for the ending that's not even happened yet in this anime, because like I said I had been enjoying the show before learning all this information.

They absolutely nailed the introduction, animation, bgm, op & ed, art & design, I truly loved it.   It would be awesome to keep it isekai/father and daughter/adventure/cuteness identity and abandon the ""romance/taboo"" for a future reference. I can see ""Usagi Drop"" as a very close resemblance to this show. For now she's just a daughter, the author seems to have the intention of moving on to the next level as time progress, through romance + taboo.  In my honest opinion, it would be far more interesting if the author avoids the typical ""finds a lost child, make a strong bond, time passes and marries that child"" taboo thing and approach it differently.

I read a review on another site that basically said ""don't get hung up on one spoiler."" Well, sorry, that spoiler just spoils the whole darned thing. Even if the early chapters of this show were 10x as good as they are, that ending would be a huge turn off. ***This is a fantasy world slice-of-life with a large and perilous setting. We get just enough hints about the world to have a sense of danger and intrigue, but it stays vague enough that it provides setting without driving the story. Instead, we're mostly learning about the world as Latina (the titular 'daughter') experiences it, which is good.The good: it's a good fantasy world, good characters, just enough action/magic to break up the cooking scenes. A general feel-good slice-of-life with magic and intrigue.The bad: You know what would be cool? A fantasy world Yotsuba&! You know what you get? A lot of cringe, some of it bordering on creepy. Like getting one bite of candy versus eating the whole bag, there is an overload of super-saccharine moments and they just aren't as fun after a while. There's also way too much screaming and wailing hysterics from the MC; misplaced theatrics that are shoehorned in and just get tiresome. And my biggest gripe of all: Latina's voice. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure the voice actress is a fantastic performer in other contexts, but this casting/direction is downright bad. An obviously grown women speaking in a breathy and squeaky toddler voice gets so old, so fast. There are SO MANY good shows that have kids of all ages and both sexes that are voiced well; there's simply no excuse.Final tally (for the season so far, not the source material): average is 3/5Art: 3/5, on par for this season but not specialStory/Characters/Concept: 4/5, love me some slice of life, especially with a twistWriting/Execution: 2/5, too much cringe and Latina's voice drives me nuts.",5
if-its-for-my-daughter-id-even-defeat-a-demon-lord,"""Wow,"" you say, ""I can't believe it's not isekai!""Yep. This is a stand-alone fantasy world. No one is sucked into a toilet, stuck in a neuro-reality helmet, or just finds themselves in a land with magic and fantasy.Before we go on, let me explain the title. This is based on an LN series wherein Dale, the male protag, saves, raises, and eventually marries Latina once she has grown into an adult. Yeah, a little squicky. I'm not spoiler-tagging this because it has nothing to do with the events in the anime.The anime (at time of this writing) is only one season, and said season ends when she's still a child. Given how low the chances of a show like this getting a sequel series, it's entirely possible to watch the anime and be overwhelmed by its innate cuteness w/o having to deal with the discomforting future presented in the LNs.Which brings us to the main point. This is slice of life. If CR would allow it, I'd insert a ""This is SPARTA!!!"" GIF here to emphasize that. This has some monster-hacking, yes, but that was maybe 5% of the show, and that's a generous estimate. The near-entirety of this show is Latina growing up, growing wise, andSpoiler Alert! Click to show or hideIn the last episode, experience feelings of possessive jealousy when Dale has to work with a former and well-endowed flame. Slice of life can take many forms. This one is of the ""unbearably cute"" variety. Aside from the first scene in which we're introduced to her, she's always wearing adorbs dresses. Even when she's working (Yes, child labor in a fantasy setting. Whodathunk?) and dressed in more practical garb, her twintails still poke out from under the kerchief.And, in case you don't get the idea that she's cuteCuteCUTE, just about every character in the show says so. Even if you're forced into watching this show (say, by a rabid fan-significant-other) you will be brainwashed into saying she's cute at the end of 12 episodes.LN aside and just taking these 12 episodes as they are, Demon Lord shows a child developing into a pre-adolescent quite believably. (Dammit, Jim) I'm not a child psychologist, so I can't say whether it is realistic or not, but it is certainly believable. As a parent, I'll say to the non-parents out there that it skip over all of the messy and draining parts of raising a kid, save the crushing void you feel when you have to leave for work.For all that I've rambled about Dale and Latina, this show has a reasonably large set of characters. Some are walk-ons, others are present only for a story arc, but they all feel like they have lives, like they have their own goals and plot arcs that just happened to intersect with that of our protags. So, I'd give it a B+ for characterization.The music is ... okay. As if you didn't get the memo, the OP and ED are bouncy, happy songs. The BGM in-show is quite acceptable, but nothing memorable. It gets a B, but's because I can hum the Totoro opening to myself for hours and not go nuts. Animation quality is low-to-middling. It's acceptable for a low-budget show, and it doesn't use obviously CGed ""sprites"". It doesn't try for novelty in how it lays out the shots, so you don't see things such as ""arrow POV"". It's a solid C. It's good, not great, but not poor, either.With all this ""it's only so-so"", why did I give it five stars? It personally sang to me. The plot is very incomplete (and many people prefer that to how the LN goes), and it has a host of other flaws. However, the love these two characters feel for one another is compelling. That alone, the feels, is enough for me to give it five stars.",4

It wasn't that it did anything wrong, it was just that it seemed content to just exist. It's just a standard slice-of-life anime. A few times in what I watched it acted like it was going to go into something else, but it always just slipped back into the same sort of thing.It's kind of like Kobiyashi's Dragon Maid, except in a few months when this is over I'll still think back fondly to Dragon Maid, and I'll likely never think about this show again.",5

I'm not a fan of the reverse Hikaru Genji tropes, which this anime unfortunately has, but overall, it's cute enough for me to watch the whole thing.Characters 3/5: Characters are fairly standard in their usual tropes. No one especially stands out or deviates from what you expect out of this anime but that doesn't mean I don't like the characters. Dale is an over-protective caring father. Latina is a cute caring young girl who always tries her best. The inn owners are a caring loving couple. And the inn patrons are rough looking on the outside but have a soft spot. Everyone is just so likable.Art/Animation 3/5: Fairly standard animation quality. Nothing looks particularly amazing but its not bad. This anime does have a slight case of weirdly large eyes but I'll chalk that up more to how its trying to emphasize how cute Latina is.Sound 4/5: I'm actually a big fan of how the soundtrack blends elements found in usual fantasy isekai, ie old school violins and classical music and the cute, simplistic music found in the slice of life, raising a child anime. It does a good job of using sound to fit the mood and themes of the anime.Enjoyment 5/5: This anime is like if you took a bunch of warm honey and poured it over a fantasy world. It's so cute. It's heartwarming. It's gonna put a smile on your face no matter how shitty of a day you've had.Overall 4/5: It's so heart warming. If you've had a hard day, just put this on and your troubles will melt away. My only complaint is that I hate the reverse Hikaru Genji tropes. This anime would be so much better without it. In a way, that trope ruins the warm pure honey that is this anime. Regardless, I would still recommend watching it.",4

The notion that you would RAISE a child like your own only to marry them is absolutely disgusting. I'm pretty sure it's illegal, too. Child grooming, look it up. Now, this is not shown in the anime, at least not yet, but supporting the story itselt is kinda screwed up if you ask me, especially knowing how much cred the author is getting out of this whole deal. How about we stop sexualizing children?",3
if-its-for-my-daughter-id-even-defeat-a-demon-lord,Such an adorably sweet anime with such a beautiful and innocent relationship between the demon girl (Latina) and the adventurer (Dale) who rescued her. It’s such a filling and heartfelt series as you see both character develop and grow in maturity. I’d love to see the series get a darker plot somewhere along the road as Dale continues to find out more about Latina’s roots with her. This is definitely worth the watch if you want something to liven up or make you feel better about your day.,5
if-its-for-my-daughter-id-even-defeat-a-demon-lord,"Dale, is Colonel Hughes level of dedicated to a girl, Latina, he found and adopted. Doting, spoiling, and willing to do whatever it takes for Latina to be happy and safe. This show is just as sweet and wholesome as Sweetness and Lightning. You'll grow attached so quickly it's hard to stop watching. If you love wholesome family anime, watch this show. If you hate feelings, don't watch this. It gives you all of the feels.Edit: Relating to other reviewsSpoiler Alert! Click to show or hideThey all mention how Dale and Latina get married. I understand how some people find that a problem. However, they are not related, at all. Yes, he did raise her, which that part makes it kinda weird. Unless there's a season 2 or ova, I wouldn't worry about it. Doesn't change my opinion of the show.

if-its-for-my-daughter-id-even-defeat-a-demon-lord,"Despite the title making one imagine this to be somewhat of an 'adventure' focused entry, this is actually more focused on the relationship of the guardian and the ward.In regards to this relationship, it does a fairly good job introducing you to the main character and the eventual girl he comes across and adopts - their interaction with the world around them and where they stand.The above said though, there is perhaps a lack of information given on the world itself - you only get a minor glimpse of what might be there, but there isn't anything concrete to tell you how the world works.I would say that this is a fairly perfect anime for what it is, but I find that it comes up lacking when really determining where things might be going. The greatest strength of this anime is its focus on the guardian/ward relationship, but that is also its weakness as another season is sorely needed to help cement this as a great anime.",4

The story is mostly told from Latina's perspective, which is that of a young child moving to a new country and meeting new people and learning the language and going to elementary school.  As such, it's pretty boring, not much happens, and there's not much drama that isn't almost instantly resolved.  Dale her adopted father dotes on her excessively and gushes about how cute she is to the point of being annoying.  It's supposed to be funny, but it isn't, it's very annoying.  There are a bunch of interesting things that are hinted at that take place in the background, but we get to see almost none of it.  .This show is cute, mostly inoffensive, and a definite change of pace from the average anime fare.  If that's what you are looking for give it a shot.  The light novels are still on going and apparently as Latina grows older she pursues Dale romantically, there are subtle hints to that end in this show especially near the end, but it's nothing that couldn't be attributed to a little girl's love for her father.  If we get more seasons that might not always be the case.  It's not technically incest but some people may be uncomfortable so this is fair warning.",4

Don't get me wrong I love the show because it's cute and heartwarming but it could be so much more. Perhaps if there is a season 2 it will explore the darker side of Latina's past and future.

From first moments of first episode you can tell its going to be something special and rest of season kept getting better and better. Story:Dont expect much action, but plenty of great and wholesome moments. I do like it doesnt shy away from darker side as well from time to time, yet it manages to do it so that it doesnt ruin shows tone. And it actually does manage to paint out larger picture of world as well. Essentially, i'd say viewers point of view and knowledge of said world is quite similar to Latina's (the little demon girl), of course with few advantages, such as seeing her guardian Dale (the adventurer) at work. So worldbuilding is actually better than it might first appear and is very well doneCharacters:This is where this show truly shines. Pretty much every character is fleshed out and even one-off characters (which there are remarkably few of) have something, anything that gives them some level of depth. And of course main cast grows a lot. This shows truly how much care is put into this.Voice actors also put effort in what they do and it shows.Art & animation:Art is just beautiful and animation is on most part good as well. The world of this anime is colorful and vibrant, yet it also pulls of darker tones such as rain or forest at night off superbly as well. It really makes it all feel alive.Only complaint about this show is, however, in here as combat animation doesnt hold up for the rest and there can be bit too much ""talking heads"" bits (nowhere near the level of death note though), but it doesnt take away from this showOverall: if you want to feel good, definite reccommendation.",4

Most people would find my brain a disturbing place they'd want to get out of because of how cynically and bleakly it sees the world. In some circles I'd be called an incel, for example, and I'm hardly a ""good"" person even in my eyes. Series like this awaken me to the fact that I may not be so bad.

They basically make her the perfect little girl, well-behaved and quick-learning, who has almost 0 attachment to her biological dad and latches onto the MC super fast.The show has no depth. Dale is irritating with how much he obsesses over Latina, and you can tell that the show is trying to get Latina to hit all of the kawaii buttons she can. I tried watching it because I liked the premise, but at the end of the day it just ended up being way too boring and superficial.

However, even if that were the case, on Dale's part he would have to go full 180 degrees in his heart to now see the daughter that he raised as a romantic/sexual partner. It is, in other words, emotional incest. Honestly, I am quite concerned for this series' author, wondering what kind of trauma they may have endured in their life to make them think that this is okay? That being said, if the anime chooses to end its story before all of that comes to pass, then it would definitely be worth watching.",5

Latina is very intelligent and learns quickly and that includes magic ability and making friends with other Kids this so far has been a very good slice of life series and I hope it gets a another season. I'm giving a low 5 on here and an 8.5 on a 10 scale of course theirs no fan service and so far very little violence I'd recommend it.

if-its-for-my-daughter-id-even-defeat-a-demon-lord,"An enjoyable excursion into a world of adventurers where top ranking adventurer Dale, becomes guardian to the recently orphaned Latina. The series is set in the land of Laband which is settled by humans and demi-humans. Adjacent to Laband are the lands such as Vassilios - ruled by the First Demon Lord and settled by demons (sometimes they are called devils)... not forgetting The Third Demon Lord who is Demon Lord of the Sea. Demons differ from humans by being much better in magic Magical beings / beasts can be dangerous to humans which is where adventurers come in. Dale very quickly learns Latina is demon born but, taken in by her innocent helplessness, he quickly moves from being rescuer to becoming her guardian. Dale is based in the city of Kreuz and so they head there to his lodgings at the inn, the Dancing Tabby Cat. In between excursions into how inn-life functions, Latina gets to grip with how human society works. The Dancing Tabby Cat is frequented by adventurers. Latina may seem too innocent to some but in remembering my youth, her lack of guile and the reactions of those about her feels right. Her disposition is endearing and the reaction of the adventurers to her rings true. As the series progresses, hints are dropped that suggest a larger (and darker) story - we discover more of Dale's background but despite some clues, Latina remains a mystery.. Just as there is conflict between humans and demons, there is internecine human conflict. It is plain to me that aspects of the larger story arc must revolve around this. The keen eyed will pick up the hints but I won't spoil this for those who haven't watched. Having watched up to episode 10 I am left in no doubt that the story tellers will not flinch if future episodes call for darker deeds to be portrayed and the later episodes leave no doubt of the ability to carry this off. Most anime suffers from 'next episode we must have a bigger and better disaster' syndrome; http://www.crunchyroll.com/if-its-for-my-daughter-id-even-defeat-a-demon-lord isn't one. This show strays from familiar MMORPG gamer territory into 'Hey this has a realistic feel' and 'Heroes with a human side... actually I like it'. Will suit those who prefer a softer, more human side to adventuring and its heroes.Glitches: tighten up on the translation (Demon or Devil?), have snappier episode titles  e.g. 'The Little Girl' and 'The Young Man' are largely superfluous after the opening episode.

if-its-for-my-daughter-id-even-defeat-a-demon-lord,"A moe version of the familiar magical empire at war SoL story. The show tends to avoid actual fight/action scenes so if you're expecting that stop reading and find another show. The show is all about the charm and warmth of raising a child and all the great and scary moments that come with. Despite the genre tags you might be looking at, the show is about character interactions, so it's heavy in dialogue and that's where the best moments are found. If I had to say something good about the show it would be setting. A vast and detailed city gives you the feeling that the town is alive, with a realistic feel to the great big adventure that is exploring it. The pacing is quite solid, creating a slow-paced feel of daily life every episode. If I had to say something bad about the show it would be the lines. Repetitive, bland conversations wear off rather quickly, turning the show into one of the most predictable shows you might see all year. Art is far below expectations with common use of ""background crowd"" faces and mediocre backgrounds. Voice acting is a problem, you'll quickly learn your least favorite characters before you find your favorites. Characters are generic as can possibly be, with a cast straight out of your stereotypical RPG. Music is quite mellow and lowkey, the kind you won't even notice or will forget ever hearing.Overall, it delivers on the premise of being a wholesome SoL but fails virtually everywhere else. There doesn't appear to be any effort put into making this anything but a heart warming drama, so the elements outside of the main story feel like a complete waste of effort. The mixing of some violence makes me caution people from thinking this is a children's show even though it has a moral undertone to the plot.If you want a story in the moe genre I think you'll enjoy, but for serious anime fans looking for a deep story you need to avoid this one.

The adventure was a little annoying when he first meets her but the show started with a balance between his abnormal over protected and jealousy and her cuteness.  That changed after the 4th episode and our adventurer, instead of adapting to being a father got even more jealous and overprotected to the point where it feels very creepy.  The 5th episode took it way over the top.  I ended up dropping this series.  I would rather watch the girl continue to grow and adapt than this “father” get creepier.",4

And thus avoided it.But after hearing that the fantasy part of the show was good, I tried to watch the first episode.The person who gave this a star mentioned, among other things, that the girl's reaction to her father being dead, and that she was ejected from her village, was unrealistic. And I agree. To a degree.But when we saw the body from the dead father, the body was long gone, I would say months. So the girl, yes, was a little too happy when she met the main character at that team was so emotionally degraded that her first instincts were to survive. I can look over this.Next is the animation, no it's not perfect but it doesn't get too bad so my eyes start to bleed. Which in my book always good;)Which makes me think that this show is actually trying (sometimes fails, ex the pause pictures -.-) not to sexualize the girl. The show tries to give a picture of a girl (perhaps a little unrealistic at times) who tries with life and its adversities. Heck, the guy mentions that ""I don't want to be from her because then I miss the moments when she understands a problem!"" For me, that is textbook one O one parents / teachers / people who want to help childern to grow. As a future kindergarten teacher, I saw this girl as one of my children. She wants to help out in the pub, learn how to cook and help with what she can.

It relies on you finding the girl cute and getting emotionally attached to her. The trouble is nothing about her is believable. She doesn't even react much to the death and burial of her father, the creators seem scared that people might find her crying annoying or something.I don't believe she exists. From the way she daintily eats her fish after wandering in the wilderness without eating for who knows how long to her being all smiles and wonder when they reach the town after burying her father. This is not the way a child acts, let alone the way one acts after being banished from her home and having her father die. This is what people *want* children to be like. Uncomplicated and cute.The only good moment was when you realize the reason her dad made her leave him was because he was going to die and he knew scavengers would be drawn to his body. I also like that the language of magic is the same language of Oni and the language barrier.The scene that made me realize it wasn't getting any better was when it was the middle of the night and he realized she needed to go to the bathroom. That would have been a great moment for some comedy. Since he only knows her language for magic, it'd make a lot of sense he wouldn't know the words for bathroom, pee, toilet, any of that. But nah, instead of having some comedy that would be natural in that setting, they just don't and it's a boring, nothing scene. I guess now we know she poops.Just don't bother unless you don't know any children or you want some escapism from the ones you do know.",1
if-its-for-my-daughter-id-even-defeat-a-demon-lord,"About 80% of the show so far has been panning shots, with stills, stiffly moving characters and a TON of lip flaps. The action that does happen is so laughably done, the monsters barely move, the violence is also toned heavily down.The series is great, but this anime does so poorly, you'd get way more out of just reading the manga instead.This feels like this series was just scraps for an incompetent or extremely inexperienced studio to take on, which gives you a less than satisfactory outcome.",4
if-its-for-my-daughter-id-even-defeat-a-demon-lord,"I love this anime so far Latina is so cute!!! And Dale is trying his hardest to be a stand in father.... I can’t wait to see what happens next hopefully Latina starts going on adventures with Dale to practice her healing magic P.S.: Ignore the one and two star comments, they are obviously comparing this anime way to much to with real life.  This is stupider to be a whole sum experience between daughter and father, but there always some idiot who has to think pervertedly and blowing things out of proportion. ~_~",4
if-its-for-my-daughter-id-even-defeat-a-demon-lord,Most of the complaints seem to be about a lack of plot. It seems these people don't understand the concept of slice of life. While this is a fantasy series it is also 100% a slice of life story without some grand story arc in the background. I know some people can't be bothered to read the source material of shows but should at least do some minimal research into something so they don't look ignorant when bashing a show for being the way it is intended to be. I personally love the manga.,1
if-its-for-my-daughter-id-even-defeat-a-demon-lord,"I was so stoked when I found out they were making an anime out of this! I just recently bought the book  as one of those ""okay, sounds interesting, whatever"" purchases and it instantly became one of my favorite additions to my library! The touching story of a father simply living life and learning to raise the daughter he never knew he wanted, but can't stop doting on while the whole ""demon lord"" plot from the title really takes a back burner is a breath of fresh air in a day and age where even the school days, slice of life animes usually have some kind of central problem. Latina is absolutely adorable and Dale's character is completely relatable. Overall, I'd give this series all the stars.",1
if-its-for-my-daughter-id-even-defeat-a-demon-lord,"Too many people have said it to be ignored: This, one of the most wholesome animes I've seen, will do a complete 180. The episode 8 already implies it.Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideDale, the adult male mc, finds a little demon girl named Latina (equal to 5 y/o human girl) in the forest, and adopts her. He starts to raise her, and acts like a overprotective father.It is clear to everyone that he considers himself as Latina's father.So, here's the thing. Apparently, in the light novel, he MARRIES HIS OWN DAUGHTER! WTF?!? DALE, YOU SICK F!I actually felt it in my stomach when I found out about this. I can't remember when that happened the last time.This betrayal came as a complete surprise.Avoid this show at all cost!",4
if-its-for-my-daughter-id-even-defeat-a-demon-lord,"I'm just going to go straight to the point, this anime is really good! It a good change of pace from all the mainstream animes. This anime has really played with my heart strings and I just can't get enough of it. An awesome adventurer adopts a little devil girl who lost her parents and was cast out from her race. In all honesty it is a little corny, but its a good kind of corny, like dad jokes, kinda. This anime is just soo adorable! However, there are some down sides, most of the animation quality is not great, some close up shots of characters do have better quality but nothing to special. Yet, just like with video games, it not all about the graphics, so the quality does not take away from what to expect when watching this anime. Also, it does seem to be rushing through, taking away from some deep character development, there is character development but I wish it could go deeper. However, since it being based from a light novel, i can see this anime only lasting 12 episodes but hey their are only 5 episodes in so far and maybe I could be wrong and it lasts longer, I sure hope so. Yet, in the end I do think this is anime that you must watch if you like a nice ""slice of life"" anime to watch. If you like some cornyness and overwhelming adorableness than watch this anime!!!!",4
if-its-for-my-daughter-id-even-defeat-a-demon-lord,"So I read most of the 3- ratings, and while they arent not justified, take those reviews with a grain of salt from what seem like Animation and story plot aficionados (people who are ""knowledgeable"" and albeit picky about their passion and hobbies). The story itself is cute, and while the animation/fight scenes aren't anything terribly spectacular, this story does a decent job showing how children can change a person. I agree with some that the plot is not super thorough in its world-building or storytelling thus far to Ep 4, but this is more of a general slice of life featuring a kid character and touches a little on racial inequality. This is a fun little slice of life anime that actually has some somewhat deeper points to it, however, I feel due to the episode count and funding possibilities, lots of content is cut so I would recommend reading the manga first which you can find here...(contains added spaces)https://mangakakalot. com/manga /for_my_daughter_i_might_even_be_able_to_defeat_the_demon_king",5

if-its-for-my-daughter-id-even-defeat-a-demon-lord,"After having watched the first three episodes, it' shard to say whether or not I'm going to come back to this series. On one hand it's nice to see something like this and get a small laugh here and there; but on the other hand, which I'm leaning to mostly, it's a series that isn't worth watching or putting my time into investing.Overall, I have other shows to watch and that more interesting and I might, highly unlikely, come back to finish the series later down the line.",5
if-its-for-my-daughter-id-even-defeat-a-demon-lord,"The main character is an adventurer that stumbles upon a devil child in a forest all by herself and seeing that she is actually kind and innocent, he takes her to his hometown. Being there, many father-daughter vibe interactions occur between the two and thus a loving bond is formed between the two. I can't get enough of these slice of life animes, it's nice to see that even though they are different and don't understand each other at first, they still show each other the fundamental and most vital expression of feeling which is love.",5
if-its-for-my-daughter-id-even-defeat-a-demon-lord,"Then you already know that your daughter doesn't even need to try to tug at your heart string. Especially, if your daughter is the only girl. Watching this is great! I am already overwhelmed with nostalgia for when my daughter was young. It is truly great given the positive environment she is placed in. If you dont have a child, this show should illuminate what a loving parent feels for a child, even if they are adopted!!",5
if-its-for-my-daughter-id-even-defeat-a-demon-lord,So usually I watch shows that are either full of action or occasionally drama/romance stuff mixed in but this show has neither so far. It is pure untapped adorableness and I love it. I was not sure what to expect with this show but one episode is enough to tell me I'm gonna watch this one weekly. I love the idea of a young skilled adventurer making time to raise this kid he's just found and they are so damn cute together. I cannot wait to see the fun father-daughter adventures they go on together and I am fully on this ride for all of it.,4
if-its-for-my-daughter-id-even-defeat-a-demon-lord,"I understand why some people are displeased with this anime but honestly i have enjoyed it so far. Dale (male main character) is kind and protective of Latina (female main character). He helped her when she is in need, provides for her however he can and worries about her. Latina is very cute and i can't wait to see how this anime ends.I don't understand why people are hating on it though.Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideI have read the spoilers about how he ends up marrying her and people think that's incest, but really i think jumping straight to incest it's a bit overboard as they aren't related in the slightest. He is a human and she is a demon. It's closer to being beastiality than incest. Lets just remember this is an anime not a reality TV show.",4
kaguya-sama-love-is-war,"I have no familiarity with the original work what so ever, never even heard of it. But god damn, this has to be one of the best first episodes of an anime I've seen in ages. It's so brutally simple, cartoonishly elite student counsel president and VP are in love with each other, but both are ridiculously prideful so instead of communicating or indeed expressing their affection in any normal way, shape, or form; they're trying to get the other to declare their love to them. The declarer's image of an independent, powerful, sophisticated, and aloof titan of world commerce and society will be ruined and they will forever be the overly-emotional, beta in the relationship while the other gets to bask in ultimate victory in their hard fought war of love.It's essentially a two tsunderes fall in love but won't admit it story line with the pride elevated to an utterly absurd level. The goofy mishaps of other romcoms are gone, replaced with calculated and precise strategies of two genius masterminds giving their all to gain the upper hand. The show plays heavily on the tropes of gambling anime (as evidenced by all those playing cards in the intro and on the poster) and almost comes off as some intoxicating hybrid of Kaiji and Toradora. Indeed, it does an amazing job of selling Love as a War and shows us a pair of extremely likable and impressive combatants. Likewise, the supporting character/collateral of the first episode is a true idiot savant, waltzing through this battlefield without a care in the world and suffering not so much as a scratch.The animation and art direction on this show are amazing. The OP blew me away with it's slick Bondian style and the rest of the episode likewise carried over that high level of production. The show, like many gambling anime (among other genres) uses overt visuals to lend a sense of grandeur equal to the intellect being thrown around. The animation was beautifully smooth and direction and ""camera"" work amazing for anime. The expressions also really stood out, while not as overt as say Hinamatsuri or Ashobi Ashobase, they are so effective and so perfectly timed to the comedy I was blown away.The soundtrack was fun (once again, the OP is gold) and the mixing was good. VAs did stellar work but I couldn't help wishing I was watching a good dub of this, between the amazing animation and rapid pace of some dialogue I was struggling to keep up.I'll admit, I'm getting bad about reviewing shows before they've really had a chance to prove themselves. But I honestly can't see this show going bad. It's base off of what I understand to be a really good manga, its shown it has amazing characters in an amazing premise and was executed damn near perfectly. Sort of a complete and total breakdown of Darling in the Franxx proportions, I can't see this show being anything less than a god tier romcom.I was concerned 2019 wasn't going to be able to follow up 2018's act but this show is making that fear look redundant.",5
kaguya-sama-love-is-war,"Coming into this I was really excited and coming out of it I was just as excited. Honestly this Show surpassed my expections and I this show did what anime is supposed to do; enhance the manga’s experience. And boy did it do that.Two things that really impressed me was the animation and the direction. The shots that they had were really smooth and lively. And overall made watching this show a blast.Overall I’m really happy with this adaptation, and look forward to continue watching this.",5
kaguya-sama-love-is-war,"...this show is freaking incredible. The MCs are two of the biggest narcissists ever portrayed in an anime. Every minor interaction between them plays out like an episode of Death Note, only instead of one of them being L they're both Light. After graduation they're probably going to enter the Supervillain track in college. The interplay between them and the rest of the cast are pure comedy gold. I was a little dubious about the narration at first but it turns out watching acts of truly breathtaking passive aggression called out play-by-play like a sports match is pure joy. I'm literally dying waiting for the next episode.Legit 10/10. If you give this one a pass you're missing out on what is easily one of the best shows of the season, possibly THE best depending on how Promised Neverland turns out.",5
kaguya-sama-love-is-war,"Original manga reader here, and I cannot stress how well done this adaptation (currently Episode 1) was.The staff could have just adapted the story panel-by-panel and the voicework, soundtrack, and animation quality alone would've brought a decent result. But that's not what we got.Instead, we got lots of details added in that weren't originally there, such as small animations added where there was none, certain sound effects, camera angles, and classic Shaft style. They didn't have to do that, but they did. And this fact tells me one thing; this was a product of love, and the staff wanted to adapt the story so that it took advantage of its new medium and make it the best product they could.",5
kaguya-sama-love-is-war,"This masterpiece evokes every emotion I want to feel from a romantic comedy. The story and how it conveys are very outstanding, it makes me laugh and makes my heart flutter. *How cute*. If you want to watch a show where two tsundere tries to outwit one another, in hopes that the OTHER person would confess; LOOK NO FURTHER. KAGUYA-SAMA IS HERE. No seriously, watch it. Plus, that opening *muah*; and that ep. 3 ending, omeegahh",5
kaguya-sama-love-is-war,"An intellectual elite, and a super-rich athlete develop feelings for each other. However, their sense of status and inflated sense of pride prevent either of them to confessing their feelings. Both have set for themselves the personal goal of getting the other to confess to them. The result is Machiavellian chess match. The artwork is good, the premise is well executed, and it's entertaining. Plenty of humor is involved, and by the end I wanted both of them to succeed. But will they? You'll have to watch.",5
kaguya-sama-love-is-war,"As my title suggest, this show is all about rom-com yet mostly about pride. Their war is not about typical couple wars but rather simple pride war. They wanna outsmart the other and make him/her confess ""first"". Some people may not like the animation as it is quite unique. Some others would probably be disturbed by the narrator's full existence throughout the show, but not me. I truly loved the 1st episode. I definitely want more! The opening is very catchy and the ending is pretty good. Characters are both messed up but you will accept them for who they are TL;DR It is highly recommended. Please do watch and support the series. Go ahead and try Episode 1.",5
kaguya-sama-love-is-war,"They* have brought the characters on the pages to life with the brilliant VAs animation, and soundtrack!  I really like the intense music haha. Thanks for bringing this wonderful series here Crunchyroll! Fasten your seat belts, this War between geniuses has just begun! Who are you voting for!? Koga Aoi, Furukawa Makoto, and Kohara Konomi have have done an outstanding job with Shinomiya, Shirogane, and Fujiwara! I look forward to seeing how they act out the most memorable moments in the manga! *Thank you Magic Capsule, Shueisha, Aniplex of America, A-1 Pictures, Mamoru Hatakeyama, Yasuhiro Nakanishi, Yuuko Yahiro, Jin Aketagawa, Kei Haneoka, Ihara Rikka, Halca, and the VAs for bringing this manga to life!And of course, thank you Aka Akasaka for creating such a marvelous series!",5
kaguya-sama-love-is-war,"So I'm here to write a deserving 5 star review and also make a long story short for anyone who's thinking about giving this one a shot. My roommates in college all hated anime. I slowly greased them up by showing them Kill la Kill and Parasyte but they all either lost interest or stopped wanting to sit down on the couch with me while I conducted my routine ""anime hour"". I was berated for weeks for hogging the couch, called a weeb, among other insults I wouldn't sully this review with. All of that changed the moment I forced them down on a new anime I was trying to watch called Kaguya Sama Love is War. Me and my roommate CJ, who NEVER liked anime to begin with, got insanely addicted to this show after the first episode. We bonded heavily over the episodes that were to follow... and boy were they just incredible. The narrator, who just randomly narrates over the funniest and most extravagantly thought out scenes I've ever seen in an anime of this style, was definitely his favorite part about the show while I was obsessed with the art style and amazing voice acting. With Kaguya Sama, I actually managed to convert someone into an anime watcher. He would come down the stairs every time a new episode came out and would beg me to open Crunchyroll so we could see that sweet 1080p. There are laughs, cringe, and especially lots of memorable moments in this show. If you want to get someone into anime, I would start with Love is War.",5
kaguya-sama-love-is-war,"I usually watch shonen or any anime with a lot of action in it, so this show isn't what I normally watch, that doesn't stop it from being spectacular though. I find myself dying of laughter at least once per episode. Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideFrom Kaguya learning what ""first time"" really means. To Ishigami wanting to die every second he is onscreen. The jokes in this show come out of nowhere and hit you hard. And this show likes to mess with your expectations with the gags. Sometimes it goes exactly how you expected it too, while other times it is completely unexpected. I have never laughed so hard at any anime before (well except maybe Mob Psycho 100/One punch man) But it's not just the comedy that makes this show what it is. It's the characters as well. Kaguya and Shigone are written in such a way that their secret love for one another feels real and genuine, like they are made for one another (even if it's going to take 1,000,000 episodes just for them to hold hands lol). Additionally characters seem to have no more than a one off gag are implied to have a deeper history.  Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideIn the latest episode we see a younger less depressed Ishigami so even he has a reason for becoming the way he is and the way he talks to Kaguya about staying away from him further makes it seem that way All in all this is a great show you should watch even if it doesn't appeal to you genre wise.",5
kaguya-sama-love-is-war,I became a huge fan of the series since the manga began and the anime does it justice. The OP sounds like it's straight out of an 80's bond film and it's one of the first I haven't skipped through to get to the anime. The anime itself is very good with great animation and the voices given to the characters sound exactly how I would imagine them to. It's definitely going on my list for best Rom-coms of 2019 and possibly all-time.,5
kaguya-sama-love-is-war,"My quest for a good romantic anime has led me to Kaguya-Sama Love Is War. It wasn’t anything what I was expecting but everything I didn’t know I wanted. Kaguya-Sama Love is War is a romantic comedy, will they won’t they story but with a psychological element to it that sets it apart from others in the genre. The story centers around the relationship of Kaguya Shinomiya and Miyuki Shirogane. They’re apart of the student council of the most prestigious high school in Japan. They’re the most popular students in the school and both are geniuses. It seemed like it was only a matter of time before they got together but as time passed neither wanted to make the first move. This introduces the psychological element to the series, getting the other to admit they have feelings for the other. Instead of the standard romance anime theme of building up the courage to confess their love, this show states there is a winner and a loser of love. The one who confesses their love is the loser of the relationship, the one with no power. With that mindset they turn everyday social situations into a battle of wits every episode in order to get the other to confess.The one thing that bothers me is how short series is. With only 12 episodes we don’t get enough character development. Sure, we’ll get to know Chika Fugiwara a little and Yu Ishigama gets an episode around him but its just enough to build around the finale. Yu and Miyuki would act like really great friends but we didn’t get to see just the two of them together often. It feels like advertisement for the manga which is currently ongoing. This is just me nitpicking so don’t let it defer you. The animation is great, the voice acting is the best I’ve experienced in an anime, characters are all great, soundtrack is great and overall it’s just hilarious.I do plan on getting the manga to see how the story progresses.",5
kaguya-sama-love-is-war,"- Character development --> 4 Stars- Writing                           --> 5 stars- Animation                      --> 5 starsThis slice of life anime hooked me from the very first episode, introducing the character complex love dynamic between the two main characters. During the end of the anime, we see that the two main characters are different from when we first met them. This is the type of slice of -life anime that get you addicted to every character and their story.",5
kaguya-sama-love-is-war,"I feel somewhat torn on Kaguya-sama. For the first half of the season, I was ready to call this one of my favorite shows of the year so far. Now, I'd just call it... ""good"". The premise, one with two strategic powerhouses finding themselves in love with one another and going to extreme lengths to make the other confess first, is a strong one. I loved watching plans get made, only to be countered by deeper layers of planning heretofore unseen, then more often than not getting foiled at the last minute by a pink-haired space cadet. Tension, humor, and a few little bittersweet moments when sometimes, things just worked out for some characters to be happy together.Then... the second half of the season happens. Dramatic swerve into paint-by-numbers romance tropes. Frantically pedaling a bike searching for someone late at night? Check. Delirious admissions while having a Japanese style ""stood in the rain fever""? Check. Uncaring parents dashing hopes of happiness? Check. Romantic fireworks scene? Check. No schemes. No cunning. No wit. Just grabbing heart strings and yanking as hard as they can to see if they can get a reaction. Then quid pro quo, reset to starting positions, try to throw in a couple of gags like everything is back to normal, roll credits. Nevermind trying to sell itself as a serious romantic drama there for a second. Just critically misunderstand one line of dialogue and pretend that's enough to throw all of that emotional development out the window.I'd still love a second season, mind. I just hope it continues with the brilliant pace of the first half.",5
kaguya-sama-love-is-war,"I was just looking through animes to watch and then I remembered about people saying that this is anime is awesome and worth the attention. At first I was quite skeptical about watching this anime because I'm not really a fan of romcom although I do end up watching it sometimes lol, but this anime just seemed so much fun. In the start I wasn't too sure about it but the more I continued watching it the more fun it got and I just loved all the characters and their different and unique personalities. If you haven't watched it yet or stopped watching it, JUST GO WATCH IT lol. trust me you will enjoy the shit out of this one XD",5
kaguya-sama-love-is-war,"It is really amazing, i loved it! i laughed a lot, and the last episodes made me cry, the voice actors were amazing, i simply loved this series! hope it gets second season! <3the work A-1 Pictures made here is astonishing, this is a high quality show that deserves to be watched just for how well the animation is done, if you add the great characters and their development to the formula you get this, one of the gems of this season!",5
kaguya-sama-love-is-war,"At the time of writing this I see one person gave this three stars and I say to that person SHAME!!  How dare they write a poor review.  This show was awesome.  It's very light hearted and short and to the point.  Very fun to watch, makes you yell at them, yell with them, laugh and cry through out each episode.  So very well done, I appreciate the writer and the creator of the anime.  Please give this one a shot, you will enjoy it!",5
kaguya-sama-love-is-war,"I was expecting a time waster and it ended up becoming my favourite anime. So much so that I'm actually reading the manga, which is something I rarely do. The characters are well written and show a lot of development, the ""battles"" (segments of each episode) are well written and the vast majority have made me laugh or given me the feels, yet it doesn't get overdone or worn out and it doesn't feel like they're dragging it on at all. The main characters are especially believable and are genuinely smart in comparison to a lot of protagonists in animes with similar plots. All in all, I'd be down to rewatch it 3 times in a row if I wasn't worried I'd wear it out for myself.",5

Click to show or hideSo the ending was ok. It was kinda boring and really misleading one what was gonna happen. Even though it is a rom-com, and I expected them to leave on a cliffhanger where they don't kiss at all, I was still hoping this show wasn't going to that cliche. Oh well. Hoping for a Season 2 where they confess or at least become more open to one another. Definitely needs one. Probably going to read the manga in the meantime and see what goes on afterward. Hopefully, that one doesn't end as badly.",5
kaguya-sama-love-is-war,"There's something interesting about the way Shinomiya and Shirogane start off the show with dramatic tension over what we would see as trivial middle-school love. But it isn't just that - it escalates into an absolute bombshell of storytelling, wit, and wholesomeness. I have never been more invested in such hilarity until this anime.The dynamic relationship between Shinomiya and Shirogane stems from what initially seems like pride. But as each episode progresses, we see them coming closer together. With Ishigami and Fujiwara being great sidekicks and great additional support cast members, the 4 characters create such a fluent and great dynamic with one another with their personalities.But the kicker of them all is just the pure adrenaline of each intensifying moment in the beginning of the show as it skewers through the thinking processes between our hero and heroine - and the drastic measure they go through in order to achieve love. This becomes toned down later on and doesn't overstay its welcome (WHICH IS GOOD BY THE WAY). I'm always excited to see what kind of crazy each episode will bring.But that's not all the goodies you get from this. You also get the wholesome bits and the backstory bits. Although the story really centers around the love power disparity between Shinomiya and Shirogane; it also shows that progress you're dying to see. Every wholesome conclusion makes you know that the two were meant to be together. It really makes it feel like progress has been made (LOOKING AT YOU ERO MANGA SENSEI.)So all in all. Yeah. Two Tsunderes in a room, what are you gonna do about it?",5
kaguya-sama-love-is-war,"I can't see this show losing any ratings from now on, so after three years of watching anime on an almost daily basis, I have decided to write my first review. (As of this writing there are 6 episodes available on Crunchyroll.) So far this show has been an extremely fresh take on the romance comedy genre. The animation is top-notch, and the inclusion of VHS filters and other visually appealing shading techniques have made this show extremely enjoyable to watch. The scenes are the right length for letting off and picking up mid-episode, and the jokes seem to last for the perfect amount of time. The many anime tropes you may see often get turned on their heads multiple times. This show has a great contrast of the two main characters acting like their lives depend on their actions, but the show knows exactly how seriously to take itself. I don't find myself laughing at many jokes in other comedy anime, but this one has jokes that caught me off-guard many, many times. The show introduces Kaguya Shinomiya with a very over the top montage of her achievements, which caused me to dislike what I knew about her character from the beginning. At first I also had a similar feeling towards Miyuki Shirogane, the student council president. After watching the first few segments, I began to associate with Shirogane and found myself wanting things to work in his favor. Further into the show I realized that Shinomiya wasn't the stuck-up wealth abusing character I thought she would be. I have reached episode 6 and I'm not rooting for one side or the other, I just enjoy seeing how the interactions play out.",5
kaguya-sama-love-is-war,"I love this anime personally. It is a comedic and dramatic way to show a misunderstanding between two people in love. Misunderstandings can sometimes be annoying in some terms but this show softens that annoyance by showing the perspective of both of the characters. In the relatable area, this can also appear in real life or by the average person, saying that that person might like someone but can't tell if they like them back. Also, trying to make them make the first move or thinking to go in first.",5
kaguya-sama-love-is-war,"Two elite students, at an elite school, prideful, scheming, and calculated, the president and vice president of the student council. They've got status, fame, and respect, but what they haven't got is the guts to tell each other that they're in love! All's fair in love and war right? And to confess your love first is to LOSE that war. Which one of them will come out on top in this slice of life comedy masterpiece?",5
kaguya-sama-love-is-war,"Looking to be my favorite anime of the season. Dry humor, Cute characters, Stylish animation that isn't too distracting and best of all a coherent plot and strong personalities.The story beats remind me of baka test but this time instead of an ensemble, we have 2 main protagonists with a limited supporting cast. The episodes essentially breakdown into what amount as contests of wit which inevitably leads to hilarity and wacky situations thanks to the wrench that is the supporting cast and their well defined idiosyncratic relationship to the two mains.",5
kaguya-sama-love-is-war,"I absolutely adored this series about them trying to not confess their love for each other. Even though there were some cliche moments and predictable scenes, it was one to remember for sure. However, the ending wasn't satisfying enough for me. But I mean everyone is different I suppose. I hope there will be another season or something!  Spoiler Alert!

kaguya-sama-love-is-war,"If you're someone like me who is typically far more action and adventure prone when it comes to your anime, you may be hesitant to watch this. But you have to believe me when I say that this anime is absolutely hilarious and so full of cute fluff that it will make you squeal for an hour after every cute moment that this show has.The two main characters, Kaguya Shinomiya and Miyuki Shirogane, are hopelessly in love with each other, but their pride would never permit them to be the first to admit it. So their school year turns into one of competing to get the other to admit their love first. Its a game of intellect, each trying to gain the upper hand by slyly avoiding their opponent's attacks and returning the blow, using all their knowledge to turn the conversation into something that would force the other into admitting defeat by confessing their love. The supporting cast is excellent, with the main supporter, Chica Fujiwara, being your stereotypical air-head who doesn't know what is going on except. She ends up playing a key role in the MCs' plans, either breaking it apart or taking it over the top to victory. The other member of the supporting cast, Yu Ishigami, tends to have the opposite effect, rarely being included in the plans yet still managing to play some part. For me, this psychological fight for dominance makes it extremely intriguing, with lovable characters and a solid romance-centered story pushing it onward, the comedy making it excel even further. Then if you consider everything else, such as the masterpiece of an OP and some amazing camerawork and facial expressions, this anime soars to the top as one of the best ROMCOMs that you will be able to watch.",5
kaguya-sama-love-is-war,"Going into this anime, I expect it to be a classic romcom with a fun twist and while it doesn't stray far from the usual tropes, it does do a great job at refining those tropes to near perfection. Story 3/5: The plot is fairly standard: the student council president is the smartest guy in school, getting top marks since forever. The vice president is a beautiful girl, also incredibly successful and her family is super rich. They like each other but can't say it. Its like they took a handful of classic romcom tropes and put them into a blender. While the general plot itself does not surprise much, how the anime refines those tropes and provides an interesting narrative and does push it above average.Characters 4/5: The characters and their interactions are what make this anime good. While the characters don't really break out of their tropes, they are all refined to such an extent that you really get a feel for each characters inner dialogue and mental state. Additionally, there is some real character development as the main protagonists push each other towards confession. Art/Animation 4/5: Characters are beautifully animated, their movements are precise and give life into the character. One notable scene is one of the ending songs where Fujiwara Chika is singing and dancing. The animators beautifully captured each frame  and her dance is very smooth.Sound 4/5: Songs in this anime have a huge dynamic range where it can at one moment sound like an epic battle of wits while in the next cutting in with a cute romantic tune. The opening song is particularly catchy and the soundtrack songs have a slight funk theme to them which ties nicely to the opening.Enjoyment 5/5: This anime is hilarious. The internal dialogue, the narration, and the individual character traits and interactions work perfectly together. It's cute, it's funny, it has its heartfelt moments and its tragic sadness. It's a very easy watch that can at times grab your attention with its humor and wit.Overall 4/5: Kaguya-Sama: Love is War is very nicely refined anime that is an incredibly enjoyable and entertaining watch. It is fairly standard as far as romcom's but the refined character tropes and humor push it to be above average and one that I would highly recommend watching.",5
kaguya-sama-love-is-war,"I was very bored one day and i decided to give this anime a shot - this is usually not my genre of anime but i am so happy that i did. This show instantly took off. It was absolutely hilarious from start to finish. The plot is very unique, not to mention the layout of the episodes along with the narration. If you want to chill and cry from laughing while being able to relate to the MCs; do yourself a favor and watch this anime. Go on, give it a shot. Youll love it. This anime is in my top 3 all time favorite anime series now. 5 STARS all the way.",5
kaguya-sama-love-is-war,"Love is War is really funny show with modern jokes that most rom-coms don't seem to have! I really reccommend that you check out the manga if you can too, it has even more hilarious references and scenes. I sure hope they make another season about the later part of the manga.TL;DR: Love is war is a great show that subverts expectations, and the manga is really worth checking out! Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideIshigami's ark is what I hope to see in the future of this show.",5
kaguya-sama-love-is-war,"While ToRaDoRa! is always going to stand out as the gold standard for Romantic Comedy shows for me, Kaguya-Sama is a romantic comedy that really delivers on the comedy.The Plot: This show has a fun premise that it spells out to you in the first couple of minutes. Everything after that is completely dedicated to revelling in the ridiculousness of the scenario that it has set up. The jokes that it drops are actually pretty funny, which makes the few moments that it pulls at your heartstrings that much more impressive. The schemes and plans that our main characters go through are all ridiculously over-thought, and all the more hilarious for it.The Characters: The characters are all flawed in extreme and hilarious ways in service of the humour and jokes, but none of their broken personality traits are grating or annoying. It would be easy for this show to slip up and make you hate how a character acted for a goof, but instead their flaws just seem all the more charming.Final Thoughts: While it's likely never going to be the first show I suggest to someone who asks me what a good romantic comedy anime is, if someone asked me for a comedy about romance, Kaguya-Sama would probably be the one.",5
kaguya-sama-love-is-war,"It may seem like a typical comedy with recycled characters.  But after watching one episode I was convinced that there is meat in this one.  The characters are not really at war of each other, and they are actually adorable.  And there is a punchline at the end of each short story.  It is so fun to watch I binge watched several episodes in one shot.  The romantic elements become more apparent in later episodes.  This is one rom-com show that should not be missed.",5
kaguya-sama-love-is-war,"Honestly, one of the best anime I've ever seen. The things that make this show really enjoyable for me was the character's interactions with each other and the very concept of this show which makes it pretty interesting. I've seen shows that show how two characters fall in love, but this is the first time I've seen one focus on making one force the other to confess their love because the writers made it easy to see that they both like each other.",5
kaguya-sama-love-is-war,"Kaguya-Sama: Love is War is nothing completely out of the ordinary, however the approach the show goes to in showing both sides fighting for the same thing in the same way is rather unique. This insight allows for some really great and well executed jokes, plus the supporting cast is fantastic in helping to proliferate these moments of comedic gold. Not to mention the chain of events that do occur help to endear both characters so when things seem to almost get to a big payoff you the viewer are also invested in their efforts just as much as they are. From a technical standpoint this show is fantastic on the animation and the gags, the only downside to this show is it's only twelve episodes long.",5

Every single episode is so entertaining that it seems almost impossible to move your sight away from the screen. The animations, the voice acting, the narrative, and the characters... everything blends together to be one of the best romantic comedies there is. There are not enough stars to give to this great show, and there are no words to properly convey how much I enjoyed it. Absolutely recommendable to any anime fan, since it's a light series enjoyable by everyone, especially for those of you who are mostly into light comedy and slice of life genres.",5
kaguya-sama-love-is-war,"Just wanted to give the show 5 stars because I want people to watch it. Don't have anything to add, CR just made me put something here. Okay and now apparently I need to submit a  longer review, because of course I would. So hopefully this is enough. And now I just noticed that little blurb at the bottom that would have shown me how many more characters I needed to add and I feel like a full retard. Thanks CR",5
kaguya-sama-love-is-war,"If you are looking for a romantic comedy this is one of the best.The romance is simple and sweet, sprinkled throughout the series and a prevalent aspect of character development. There is more humor and comedy than romance but what little there is, is heartwarming and gooey.Comedy is slapsticky and fueled by wonderfully quirky characters. The style and presentation of romance and it's 'war' aspects adds the the humorous appeal of the show.",5
kaguya-sama-love-is-war,"I'm going to hit a few points about the show and state how I feel about how the show did in said regards.Music - The soundtrack is one of the best I've heard. The best for the romance genre that I can think of off of the top of my head. I'd probably only hold a few shows in totality higher in regard for music, but even then I have to drive the point home that the music is amazing. I still can't get enough of the opening ""Love Dramatic feat. Rikka Ihara by Masayuki Suzuki""Plot - Or should I say substance? While the plot itself isn't anything complex or intricate, it definitely feels original. Each episode is two to three mini stories that involve the Student Council members and build up the relationship between the characters. While they are mini-stories they don't fall into the same trap other shows with a similar structure do, which is fail to connect the stories. Each and every episode has meaning. Callbacks are made quite frequently to events that happened earlier in the show and character development is made quite clear in the show. I'd say the only problem I have with character development is it feels over-exaggerated. Although with how the show carries itself, it doesn't seem out of place, it may even be a positive thing when taking into account its story structure.Character Design - Definitely the weakest part of the show. I will put my own bias here however and state that since the show is following the manga very well I don't doubt that the show will also dive into the character's backstories deeper than the show has currently. So I do have to say this is a negative, but honestly the trope problem doesn't really feel like a problem just due to how the show carries itself.My Thoughts - Obviously the most important part because some random dude on the internet is definitely a ""flawless critic"" eh? I didn't really touch on many points because there aren't many points to hit on in this show. It's just a really good show. A very lighthearted rom-com with no NTR, love triangles, ect. (Honestly the zero live triangles is probably enough reason to rate an anime highly these days). There's more I'd like to talk about the show. Like how the ""Love is War"" trope starts to fall apart late in the anime and will continue to do so following the manga. It becomes less about convincing the other to act on their emotions and more about the fact that they personally cannot act on their emotions so there is a lot more hope about confession rather than tactics. I think it's actually a nice development because it shows the irrationality that is love. Although I'm going to just end my review here and give it a rating.I wish you could give half stars because while I really loved this show, I don't think it's a full 5/5. I'd definitely say a solid 4.5/5, and I'd really think the only thing stopping it from being a perfect show in my books is it does become tropy and slightly repetitive although not nearly enough to turn someone away from the show in my opinion.",4
kaguya-sama-love-is-war,"I realy and truly, loved and adored this show.just has so many amazing qualities and elements to it! The best part of the this show was how the characters change and evolve throughout the few 12 episodes there are in it.

kaguya-sama-love-is-war,"Not only is the source material for Kaguya-sama fantastic in its own right, this adaptation knocks it out of the park! The voice actors, animators, directors, and everyone else involved in the production has done an amazing job in bringing this series to life. The show itself is a hysterical romp through the daily ""battles"" between two of the most lovable genius-level idiots in an anime.

It was, without a doubt, one of the best anime's I've viewed in my 2+ years of watching all sorts of shows. Crunchyroll, thank you for spreading the gift of anime to different countries for many viewers, such as me, to enjoy. This show has everything I'd ever want with an amazing opening, closing, characters, development, and more. I can't wait to read the manga of this series as I truly do look forward to doing so.

I am now addicted to rom-com animes.Everything about this anime was just... perfect. The characters were funny and loveable and the voice actors did an amazing job. The pacing of the show was fantastic with its short stories following up to a 2 or 3 episode long arc. The humor had me giggling like I was a school girl. And the animation was flawless.The last episode of this season left me wanting more and I pray that it gets a second season.

It gave me a good chuckle, and wanting to take a break from stuff like MHA and JoJo, I decided to give this show a try.This show is a masterpiece. The first episode gave a strong foundation, introducing the our leads, and made me chuckle a couple of times. Growing up with Death Note, I love the mind game aspects from both Kaguya and Miyuki, even though I know they're both being incredibly stupid. It's absolutely hilarious seeing them come up with these crazy ideas, almost succeed, until either Chika or Ishigami come in and everything starts crumbling down in the most hysterical way possibleI also love that when it's not funny, it can get real, and I like that. Not saying other romcoms don't do that, but there's something that feels actually real about this.I'd say that this is probably at least top 3 of one of my favorite animes of all time.",5
kaguya-sama-love-is-war,"You know an anime is incredible when after an episode concludes, you’re heart is aflutter and you’re thinking about so many trailing ‘what-ifs’. Kaguya-sama: Love is War, beautifully captures the obsessive idealization and awkwardness that seems to define every adolescent introverts first romantic excursions. With rich character interactions that are seldom wasteful, frequent comedic excursions down a winding rabbit hole of opportunistic conjecture, the plot is all wrapped up in the familiar school setting that serves as a backdrop for Shriogane and Kaguya’s greater theatrical romantic escapades. Far too often supporting characters exist exclusively to further the plot. By this I mean, if you cannot imagine a character on there own outside of the overarching story, then they have had weak character development. Fujiwara and Ishigami, the two main heroes of this story (for having to put up with the always at-odds love birds), are superbly fleshed out, and it’s easy to grin as one enters into a scene, because we know that their unique qualities will set an already turbulent mood aflame. Fujiwara is so strong a character we actually saw an entire, random scene dedicated to her in a ramen shop, and the entire subplot was both natural and welcome. The fact that any of us found a ‘filler’ scene enjoyable was thanks in due part to Fujiwara’s incredible backstory. Kaguya and Shriogane are both such frustratingly adorable characters. Their plight is so reminiscent of most folks romantic experiences back in high school. Due to their extreme stubbornness and really poor self-esteem (as supported by Shriogane’s reoccurring thought of  ‘so cute’, which reached a crescendo in the season’s finale), they are both engaged in a strategic game of mental chess to force the other into submission to get the other to proclaim their love. Seriously though, Kaguya literally planned to corner Shirogane on a rainy day when the trains are shut down in order to get him to offer her his umbrella, and when the train schedule resumed, so Shirogane wouldn’t know, she swapped out his phone battery with a dead one she kept stored in the club room. A little creepy AF, but in a loving way, you know? Kaguya for waifu 2019?These characters definitely imparted onto me the true pleasure they felt. I found myself smiling at my TV (undoubtedly giving it mixed signals), at the end of most episodes. It was clear to me that the happiness I felt at those moments was the same as the character’s whom I watched, serving to deepen my adoration and support for their cause, and bringing me back week after to week to continue on the journey with them.",5
kaguya-sama-love-is-war,"Kaguya-sama: Love is War is a battle of the brains, where the first one to confess loses!It is by far one of the best romantic comedy anime I have seen to date, with a ridiculously smart way of using the will they won't they trope. Instead of having two characters that are obviously madly in love with each other, forcing the audience to wait or sometimes never get a romantic resolution. Love is War creates a much more absurd but ultimately devilishly impressive solution. The lovebirds simply have unreasonable levels of pride and an intense inferiority complex. Most romcom dilemmas that create stagnation revolve around the ""do they like me or do they not like me"" question, however our two leads Kaguya Shinomiya and Miyuki Shirogane are instead SO convinced the other is in love with them and is about to confess. This in turn creates the doubts in the first place about whether the other likes them, a byproduct of the mind games, psychological warfare and impatient attempts to have the other confess sooner, or at the very least give in a little. A fascinating execution for romcom dilemmas if I say so myself, especially since that same pride and inferiority complex I mentioned is likely to be what brought them together in the first place.All that on it's own is pretty solid for a romcom premise, but Love is War doesn't stop there, cause I haven't even mentioned a pink haired little joker in our deck of cards yet. The side characters of this anime have just as strong as a performance as our two leads, Ai Hayasaka, Yuu Ishigami, and even the presence of a fantastic narrator put on a great supporting performance. Ah yes, and then there's the joker of this deck, Chika Fujiwara, at first a she is seemingly nothing more than a ditsy girl who gets in the way of Kaguya and Miyuki, causing their plans to crumble spectacularly with maximum hilarity. In truth however she is a well-adjusted and competent enough girl to read the situations surrounding Kaguya and Miyuki, assisting them and driving them forward towards more reasonable approaches to solving their shortcomings. She still is unpredictable and a great comedy relief character, with on point reactions and comedic timing that made pretty much 100% of the jokes land.Kaguya-sama Love is War is hands down my favorite anime to come out of 2019 so far. There's not a single thing this romcom doesn't do right, from it's comedy, characters, production value, script, voice acting, scene composition, YOU NAME IT! A damn near flawlessly executed romcom that should force all other future romcoms to take notes, and my first contender for best anime of 2019!",5

Very little about this romantic comedy is standard fair for the genre in terms of style and substance and that's what makes it stand out.Throw in an absolutely awesome opening theme and you have a solid 5 star anime. It's not gonna be everyone's cup of tea, but for those with a taste for this sort of thing, they are going to be very satisfied!

I'm a pretty critical person, it's rare when I legitimately can't find a failing or disappointing aspect about something.

Sure theres better anime, but theres also worse, the humor is funny, not busting any stitches, but i cracked a smile. The action is copy paste action, but this is not the first show to do that, and probably not the last. The story will most likely end up where the rest of them do, nothing really happens for most of the show, then a ""problem"" occurs toward the end, and the protagonist saves the day some how.

I don't know about the author's original intent, but this is the sort of show you need to go into treating it as more of a slice-of-life comedy without any deep story beyond that.Having said that, this show is the definition of a guilty pleasure for me, and I'll definitely be watching through the whole season regardless of how good (or not) it will be. I won't excuse any of its flaws, but I'll indulge out of an irrational affection anyway. And really, that's all you need to keep in mind when deciding whether or not to watch this anime.",5

I'm actually kind of disappointed, the animation quality doesn't seem to be where I had hoped and as of EP 2 they cut out some details I was hoping to actually see. (EX: Yae's fight with her fathers former student.)Also, they down play a lot or out-right remove when Touya actually uses his phone for things, which makes it seems like it has become instantly useless from the start after he learns magic.All in all, it's ok, but they seems to be going out of their way to make it as generic as possible.",4

It was over before I knew it and it felt as if the progress the protagonist made with all the new spells was for nothing. Geez.",5
in-another-world-with-my-smartphone,"I consider myself a verbose man, yet even I do not have the linguistic skill necessary to properly ward people off this absolute tragedy of an anime. Plenty of people defending this show are talking about those who dislike it being 'anime snobs'. Hopefully, this review debunks that, if only slightly.MC is godly powerful. That's fine, I like godly MCs when they get executed correctly. With someone so powerful that winning every combat is a given the only place left to go is character development and world building. Right? Wrong. The anime builds its world decently through the vessel of characters you couldn't care about if you were their parent.Other people have hit this, but I'm letting you know it's true. MC is a nice guy who is always nice and everything always goes nicely nice. It's tragic how little depth these characters have considering the art direction of this anime was actually decent. Wanna have a good time with this anime? Get your buddies together and take a shot every time the MC is polite. You'll be dead by episode three, which if you're watching this will feel like a mercy. I'd be willing to play Russian roulette if the terms were to pull the trigger every time the MC showed personality. I'd have a zero percent chance of death!I could keep going, but this anime isn't worth the time. If you want a blandly nice MC who gets all the girls because he's polite and strong then be my guest. Be aware there are zero stakes in this show, nothing matters, and you never feel like the characters are in danger. You never feel like the characters are suffering. The characters never grow. Static characters in a boring bout of isekai wish fulfillment. GetMeOut",3
in-another-world-with-my-smartphone,"I really want to like this show, it makes a decent attempt at comedy, characters at least at first seem likable enough and ultimately I feel a vast majority of it falls flat. The stories narrative elements never truly drove me. Each character felt like a trope more than an actual person, there personalities and dialogues falling very closely to lines already drawn many times before by successor shows. Unfortunately this didn't improve much as the show went on. The cute narrative gimmicky element was a nice add on at times, and provided a bit of thought as to how a smartphone would work in a world where their were no cell phone towers but magic, however this was largely hand waved with the power of god. Previous anime have also showed us how fun it can be to follow around an overpowered protagonist, for example, One punch man, The Devil is a Part timer, MOB psycho, Overlord and Death March, just to name a couple. However, this show doesn't deliver on that same sense of satisfaction once a battle is one, or comedic elements of what it means to be the best.This show feels like it tried to bite off more than it could chew, throwing together too many elements and characters in addition to the plot gimmicks that forced each individual element to feel a little shallow, preventing this story from truly shining.",3
in-another-world-with-my-smartphone,"If you ever played a video game, and used cheat codes to give yourself godmode, unlimited money, and every other possible buff the game allows, that's this anime.This isn't a slice of life anime, which you might expect to not have any real conflict. It's an adventure story with no real adventure - because nothing can actually go wrong.It's like a child's story that stars himself, which you would naturally expect would feature him as the center of the world, with unreasonable powers and abilities, loved by all.If you watch this, you'll quickly find that while there's no real reason not to watch it, there's no real reason to keep going either. You won't be left wondering what will happen the next episode, because you already know - the protagonist will solve any problem with little to no effort. As each episode passes you will find yourself wondering when the main plot will start, until you realize there's not going to be a struggle to overcome. It's just more of this. If you just want an anime where you can fawn over waifu's without having any angst about what will happen next, this may be the anime for you.",3
in-another-world-with-my-smartphone,"This anime is not 5 outta 5 stars type of anime, but it's good enough to pass the time and to possibly make ya wanna read the light novel (I know I ended up reading it). In any case, I think it's overall pretty good but it doesn't make you think or ponder stuff like Overlord, Re:Zero or Konosuba and so on.So, grab some drinks, food and prepare yourself for a little more than average show to pass the season. :)P.S.: Don't listen (unless you want to) to the anime snobs cuz they hate that everything that isn't pure diamond or gorey.",2
in-another-world-with-my-smartphone,"Summary:Boy accidentally gets killed because God is clumsy. He feels bad for boy so he sends him to a fantasy world with all the fighting skill and knowledge on all the magic he could ever ask for. Boy stumbles into two girls in distress. Boy saves girls and thus he starts his harem adventures.Review: If you're going into this series expecting a grand story to unfold, then you'd be better off watching something that won't waste your time because in this series there is nothing to look forward to. There is no goal, no motivations, no conflict. Each episode is just this guy living out his own fantasy and having all the girls he meets fall in love with him, because why not. The characters are your typical archetypes, and trust me when I say they made the females in this series dumber than a bag of rocks and it's the male lead that shines because he can never do no wrong. The animation is very generic, but the art is vibrant and pleasant to look at, yet I wouldn't say it's anything special. The music is forgetable, despite the tracks do carry a tone throughout the series. The voice acting ain't bad just average all round. So overall I didn't find this series to be fun to watch as there is nothing that kept me invested. So if I were you I'd avoid watching this show and instead go watch Konosuba or go watch Re: Zero which have similar premise, and they're entertaining to watch.",1
in-another-world-with-my-smartphone,"This is the most poorly written hunk of junk I have ever watched. All the characters essentially have no personality, including the main character. There is no sense of drama or anxiety, no challenge what so ever. the entire plot can be summed up as 1) problem exists 2) MC can solve it instantly and with ease 3) stuff and 4) MC solves it instantly and with ease, and everybody loves him.In short, this show is a complete pandering sellout piece of trash. And that is being kind.",2
in-another-world-with-my-smartphone,"Summary: Essentially, the beginning is what would happen in every light novel that starts the story with challenges, obstacles, and emotion were to be on their last episode. The character gets everything they could ever want, in the first episode. If you want a character who doesn't develop, and will remain the same guy as he was in episode one, you've found the 12 episode series for you. Complaints: If you're going to have a character be so deadpan, and unrealistically react to situations, then I'm glad you continued that style with the harem he's in. Our MC has the same reaction to his harem that any other unrealistically virgin male would have, he completely ignores them and doesn't want anything psychical with them. He sometimes has perverted thoughts, but when you're a god with every power in the universe and perfect mind and body(and then some) You'll know that it really is better to keep your thoughts to yourself, and that you don't deserve the love of those around you. His relationships essentially turn into minor perversions in his head, with nothing but a range of pandering girl archetypes. The MC is overpowered, but not in a funny way, the show takes the problems very seriously. You can tell it's serious with the lack of prevailing conflict. A character who was less serious would get cocky, and leave the problem to fester. This MC prefers to end all problems right away, before they have a chance to grow uncontro- Oh my bad, nothing unfixable. Our MC is both the plot-armor and plot-sword. If there's a problem, it only happens to other people. If those other people know of our MC, they won't have a problem after he waives his hand. Like a real magician, he made that problem disappear. Oh, was that a joke, this show doesn't have those. It's a 24/7 serious fluff show. Everything that happens doesn't have any effect on our MC, even a new girl joining his harem isn't an event. As I've stated before, none of the relationships ever move. Some of them have time limits, but those don't matter, because the time-skips are negligible, and rarely skip to an interesting moment. Last but not least, combat. The combat scenes are often every person doing a move to finish off the enemies. Everyone contributes some aspect of their abilities to the end result, which is them winning every time. Usually a battle starts with something that seems pretty serious, or a mission they have to complete, or perhaps a godlike figure. In the end, if his team of chicks can't win, MC will pull out his plot armor and plot sword, and end the battle. Afterwards, the MC is showered in praise, money, and influence. You're probably wondering, what does all of this have to do with a smart phone? Very little. He doesn't spend very much time on it, and the times he does are the ex-machina for specific situations, or to have a short chat with God.I had these same complaints when I read the light novel, after a friend recommended it to me. There's more to the light novel, but the results are the same.",5
in-another-world-with-my-smartphone,"The MC is not interesting of a character, and all the side characters act like they're in Japan even though they're in a different world (i.e ""no stealing, no misusing your powers!!!"").  The MC's smartphone is not relied upon much (which is fine), but his granted powers pretty much make him a god in the new world, but he doesn't do anything about it because he is boring.  Literately, that's the reason, he is boring.      The magic system is cool but why did they have to explain everything about magic when the MC can do whatever he wants because he technically can do anything!     Honestly, this series could have been much better.  I feel like this show would be great if it explored how someone with a smartphone could change a less developed world, akin to Log Horizon.  But nope, just a useless MC with god power gimmicks and stereotypical girl side characters going on generic adventures. Sigh",3.5

in-another-world-with-my-smartphone,"cliff notes: it sucks, don't watch it. long review:After fully completing the season all. If you are looking for a wish fulfillment or a show that's a great learning example for how not to tell a story, this is the show for you. Or if you are versed in the mystic arts of ""turning off your brain"" then i guess it really doesn't matter what youre watching, so this is for you too by default. But for everyone else, i cant (even a little) recommend watching this show over all the other great ""sekai"" shows out there. Anime like konosuba and re:zero really explore some interesting themes and perspectives (though on complete opposed ends of the spectrum). Where as with this show there is nothing of interest explored throughout the entire 12 episodes of this show. Every single encounter (with maybe one exception to the last fight) is completely weightless and devoid of any real significance or meaning. If their intent was ""here is why abusing cheat codes is bad"" then sure, i guess the narrative delivered because its outright cringe worthy otherwise. As for characters, they don't develop them much. In the end, i honestly only cared a little about one of them and don't really have much to say about anyone else. Especially the protagonist. I don't think its possible to make a more unrelatable character. Heck i've related more to a literal square (as in the shape) character than i did this dude. Now that i think back on it, I don't think dude was human after he went to the other world. I don't even think he was a robot/android either because at least programs have some sort of bugs (i.e. flaws). Here they present protagonist_1 as this perfect individual who can do basically anything because, literally, deus ex machina.As for cinematography and music... it was ok most of the time but there were moments when the obnoxiously long fan service scenes and intrusive sound track's completely destroyed the immersion (and mind you, i really enjoyed keijo and girls bravo. let that sink in). In the end, it does some things right but does a lot of things wrong. And by wrong i mean things that effect suspension of disbelief. Things that get us to care about characters. ANYTHING to anchor us into the world. as an example... spoilers btw (i do rant a bit lol. that's your warning)Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideHe shows up into the world. Oh darn i don't have any money. Conveniently someone shows up, likes his suit and wants to buy it. Dont worry about cloths, he is a tailor and can make you some. So, he traded the shirt off of his back for another, free, shirt, a free ride into town, and a scrooge mcduck style bag of gold.What happens after that? maybe it would be difficult to find his way around town? Nope. dont worry he has google maps for that. wouldn't want him to have any kind of hardships after being ripped from his world and thrown into a completely unfamiliar and strange land. That might boarder on the lines of being interesting. Later on he meets up with two chicks doing some sort of a drug deal for this crystal they found in what i can only imagine is the raspiest looking alleyway the city had to offer. And of course he ended up saving the day and adds two new waifu to his party. They learn shortly afterwords that he cant read. Having him not able to read would be problematic so naturally this gets resolved in about 2 minutes. honestly, at this point i think gate did a much better job of covering that aspect of it where you could see an honest effort and struggle... but i digress...anyways, i hope this helps give an idea of what kind of disappointment waits for you ahead in this show because it most certainly doesn't get any better. side note: what i was mentioning before about the one fight scene that has some weight to it. its the one where this dude lost. i mean, he still got his +2 waifu's added to the harem but at least we got to see him in some form of a vulnerable state. anyways, i hope this long rant helped you come to a resolution one way or the other. And to that i say have an excellent rest of your day.",4
in-another-world-with-my-smartphone,"edit: after 11 eps of watching. it's not as bad as i made it out to be. i just really prefer the read material for this type of series i guess. it got better around episode 3-5 or somewhere. hell it's a series that can't be explained why you like it. no stakes in ANYTHING AT ALL. which is nice if you just want to chill and read... or watch in this case.Read up to vol. 3 of the light novel. normally hate stuff where the main character is crazy op. but this one i like for some reason. I just look at him as a red mage from Final Fantasy 11. (permanent regen of mana, can use up to a certain spells and sword skills of everything. cannot use advanced spells or sword play). but the light novels had a charm where there was zero tension on if the character will survive in the world and how much pain he'll go through to get anywhere in that world. the LNs just followed his life in this new world. for an isekai series it's just fun. so avoid this series if you hate the following... if you don't like over powered characters, don't touch this anime. once he has use of his smart phone with magic don't expect him to be hurt easily. also don't watch this if you hate harem anime.edit:  I watched the first two episodes and it feels... to fast paced and the world building is not there. which to me, was a huge point of the light novel. events are done out of order (not really a problem for most people.) also, the animation is not very good... I recommend the light novel instead of the anime. also if you didn't know the author writes the entire series on his smartphone. which i believe is the reason he made it about a smartphone.",1
in-another-world-with-my-smartphone,"3 eps in and this show still doesn't seem to have any direction.     Gimmick is MC has a smartphone in an another world, and is OP, and his friends are OP. OK. That's ok Slime made it work so it could work here, right?     No. MC is a push over with no apparent wants of his own. At least non that I know of. Or I have forgotten about it already because nothing interesting happens. Main group just appears to wander around without any bigger ambitions.     My main gripe is that he has a fricking smartphone in an issekai and all he does is mundane things. OP powers are really unnecessary when he comes to effectively medieval world with this level of technology. He could make hand over fist mad dosh by copying maps from his phone. He could be crazy siege engineer. But this devolves into basic bitch boring issekai and it really feels like I'm wasting time watching this.",1
in-another-world-with-my-smartphone,"I read some of the reviews, and I'm seeing titles like ""It's not really that bad"", which has 5 stars.If you need to preface it that it's not bad, then it's also not good. I'm trying to get through the 1st season, and it's tough. By episode 8, I don't know why the girls are there, except for service. He doesn't struggle for anything, and everything comes easy. If he can use every magic possible, then why have other magic users: he should be able to learn every spell, and adventure on his own.The jokes are meh. The adventure is meh. He's overpowered, His personality is so stunning that everyone loves him.Anyone who is his adversary evaporates after one scene, maybe two.At least the service isn't over the top.",1

It's not offensive or anything, just not something to watch if you want a good story. It's... Like an anime of all filler. Nothing really has any consequences and that's fine. Just don't expect it to be as interesting as something like Overlord, Konosuba, or Rising of the Shield Hero. It's just lazy junk food anime and that's ok every once and a while. Still doesn't make it good.",2
in-another-world-with-my-smartphone,This show is a very bland isekai with very little to no plot at all. It's more of a show to pass time as the main character is op and there is no plot or character development. The harem style of the anime is also very predictable from the beginning. I would recommend this show to people who need anime to watch if they have nothing else or just want another isekai. Do not watch this show expecting something big. It won't happen.,1
in-another-world-with-my-smartphone,"This anime doesn't pretend to be anything than it actually is. It has an overpowered MC that can resolve any problem pretty much immediately, it has a harem aspect with some fan service, and it has a happy-go-lucky feel to it. Lots of reviews on here are pretty negative but if you're coming to this anime for a brief fun vibe, then you're in the right place. If you're here for a full blown out plot line with twists and turns and suspense...you should probably look else where. I'd give it 4 stars usually, only giving it 5 to try and average out it's overall reviews with the super negative ones",1

But the site wouldn't let me post unless I added unnecessary gibberish.",1
in-another-world-with-my-smartphone,"This is a tough show to review.  I had very low expectations going into the show, having watched it a season late.  It's not a top-notch show by any means, even within its own specific sub-genre.  But for some reason, I did enjoy watching it.  If you're going to watch this show, it's best to go in with the clear understanding that this is about the most blatant, ridiculous, over-the-top adolescent male power fantasy you'll ever see.  MC doesn't just enter the world with his smartphone.  In fact, he's more or less turned invincible by God as an ""oh, by the way"" moment, and time after time, he simply relies on these enhanced abilities rather than his smartphone.  You wonder if the author realized after the premise was established that only having a working smartphone would be a pretty lame ""superpower"" in a fantasy world, and said ""screw it, I'll just make him invincible.""  Oh, and all the girls fall in love with him, naturally enough.  Yeah, that type of show.I suppose if you can get past this, and just enjoy the show for the lighthearted romp through a generic fantasy land (and it doesn't really try to even take itself seriously), then you'll probably have fun watching.  Think of it more like Dog Days, where you don't really want to see anyone (important) getting killed, or even seriously hurt.3/5 stars because while it's not great, it's not terrible, and actually kept me entertained.",3.5
in-another-world-with-my-smartphone,"This work definitely brags about its 2 very cliché themes in animes - teleporting into other worlds, OP protagonists and lots of girls. It does not have much in it to squeeze out, even compared to the already light LN. I edited this and changed the review, since it is definitely a relaxing work, especially after finishing relatively heavier titles such as Black Lagoon, or the heartbreaking ending of WorldEnd with the sweet, sweet Scarborough Fair that forced me into tears even after having read the LN. Not good if you are expecting another great title like Zero, or being a hardcore or even snobby viewer all the time, but definitely a light and relaxing work to watch for chilling, that does not require much attention from the viewer.",3.5
in-another-world-with-my-smartphone,"It's a cliche harem anime, it is very entertaining and fulfills many of the cliches of a harem anime or even just fantasy anime in general. The story itself is not very deep or original, but it is very entertaining to watch if you just want to take your mind off of things. I enjoyed it just based on the general happy tone of the anime and positive upbeat attitudes of the main characters. It's definitely fun to watch (minus some of the more socially taboo scenes), but if you are looking for an anime that is deep you won't find it here.",2
in-another-world-with-my-smartphone,"This is one of the dumbest, most unoriginal anime I've ever seen - it takes a recently overused premise of ""being transported to another world"" and pretty much uses it to replicate every predictable cliche of fantasy harem shows. It also adds a ridiculously overpowered, literally invulnerable protagonist that overcomes every challenge without breaking a sweat, eliminating any possibility of tension or uncertainty from the story. With flat characters (maybe with slight exceptions of Yumina [best girl <3] and Leen), simplistic plot and lack of any real stakes, it might challenge the slowest slice-of-life high school shows in pointlessness. What saves it a bit (but not that much) is the fact that it's completely aware of its trashiness and embraces it to the fullest. It also does it in a more timid, approachable fashion than for example HighschoolDxD (only the last three episodes of the first season go hard on the ""ecchi"" factor). If you don't try to take it seriously at any point, you can find some decent humour and relaxing, mindless fun in it, especially in the opening episodes. Also, it somehow manages to lead harem scenario to it's logical conclusion, with proper confession scenes and protagonist being forced to realize his situation and react in some tangible ways - that was actually quite unusual and amusing.In Another World With My Smartphone is a dirty pleasure at best, but on a cloudy afternoon, when you just want to turn your brain off and have a laugh at the sheer ridiculousness of it, it might just be the right thing.",3
in-another-world-with-my-smartphone,"I binged the entire season. It wasn't the most 'epic' of series with plot twists, dark areas, or asking in the matter of philosophical concepts. Instead, it's a harem where connection meets the best of two worlds: the harem comes together, and the comedy is common-sense. -1 Star for not keeping certain aspects of the harem interesting. Everyone knows they can brainstorm better on it.You have humor, predictability, common-sense, practicality, a harem THAT ACTUALLY HAS A FUTURE, and the capability to take the story literally wherever the animators want to go. So don't mess up; I'm waiting to see the second season. Keep it twisting and interesting. Don't press too hard on the 'God mode"" but don't ultimately take it away. Keep it sensible and reasonable, and everything will come together. Do not slack on character development (this is the most important--and hopefully I noticed it started to build). Good luck and give the show a run! It's good and funny!",1
in-another-world-with-my-smartphone,"Okay, so I originally avoided this show because I'm not into harem shows aimed at boys since a lot of them have ecchi.But after seeing Gigguk's video featuring this, I just had to see for myself how bad it is, so I watched the first episode and said...""... Shoot. I actually like this.""So now I'm an avid follower of this show and am probably(Definitely) going to buy the series if it ever hits iTunes for digital download.Heck, I'm even writing a fan fiction about this show by inserting a 5 year old OC that I created just for this purpose. Of course, it's more for my own enjoyment than something I would actually post to the internet or show anyone. (Just so you know, I love inserting OCs into shows I really like, just so I can create different situations for the characters to be in)I'm even re-watching this series as I'm waiting for episode 9, and I am still enjoying it for some odd reason.This show is not that good. But to me it's a great one to just watch and feel happy. It's not terrible, it's not revolutionary, and it's not unpredictable.It's just... Fun to watch for some reason.However, if there is one thing I have to highlight about this series, it's the fact that I can't tell what direction its going in at times.Sure, it's not unpredictable, but there is a sense of vague surprise at some of the solutions, as well as situations, that the characters work through. For a happy go lucky show, there is a bit of thinking going on that I didn't expect. Episodes 3 and 4 are a good example of this.The main character(Touya) may be a bit bland, but at the same time he's got a slight personality to him. It may be because I don't watch a lot of harem anime, but I find his character pleasing.Yes, this show has flaws, but for some strange reason, I don't mind them enough to see them completely. It's either that or I haven't seen enough shows to actually be able to point them out.Well, that's all I have to say......Well, except one thing...For some reason... I feel like the show is foreshadowing something that doesn't fit the atmosphere of the show at the moment. Sure, everyone is happy now, but something feels off, and the first hint is in the show's description. It says the Touya ""inherits the legacy of an ancient civilization."" However... Well... Keep this in mind when you're watching episodes 3 and 8. Sure, it says that Touya has ""carefree travels,"" but I can't help but wonder if that's going to be true for the whole series.If I'm wrong about this hunch, feel free to laugh at me for overthinking things.Anyway!

The only true complaint I have so far is that I feel they could do a lot more with the smartphone itself, there's so many ways to use it in this world that they barely even tap into. All in all the show has it's flaws, but I enjoy it tremendously never the less because it's not trying to be too serious like so many others.",5
in-another-world-with-my-smartphone,"It's boring.  I can't relate to the main character.  the decision to keep the iPhone was stupid and no where NEAR what any real human being would have asked for (like maybe money or magic powers) but of course he gets those anyway.  The animation is crap and the fight choreography is cheap.  I honestly can't think of a good point for the show because not even the idea is a good one considering how over done it is.  How did this get made?When you write yourself into a story, it can be very hard to determine how you actually react to the various scenarios that appear in said story.  What usually happens is you create a surreal, ""objective"" type of character who responds to every situation w/o flinching or slipping up.In spite of the fact that (in real life) you DON'T make friends with a group of the most attractive, talented, fun people around, your MC manages to do so instantly.  Despite the fact that (in real life) you only have a few talents, your MC gets every magical power, including, no, ESPECIALLY the super extra-special-AWESOME power that NO ONE has.  I feel like that's what this story was.",5
in-another-world-with-my-smartphone,"This show man. It didn't have to be this bad. Sure the premise is overdone and uninspired but I was looking forward to at least something mildly entertaining... distracting even. But this is too painful. I haven't actually heard anyone talk about what they like in this show so I'll be specific. The character designs are terrible, the animation is flip book quality, the character personalities are vapid, the script is bland and uninspired, and the direction bland and thoughtless. The comedy is also non-existent. Maybe the God conversation at the beginning would have made me laugh more if I hadn't already seen it done better a year ago. Even A Centaur's Life has some production value. I felt like I had to watch at least the first episode all the way through for this review but nothing would have changed if I stopped 8 minutes in. I was constantly checking the timeline to see how close the episode was to ending. Of the 15+ new shows I've checked out this season, this was probably the hardest to watch.I've read now a couple of the reviews crying ""ripoff"" and yeah, those reviews are pretty  and poorly written. Besides that's the LEAST of this shows actual problems. Also, it's not like the ""this show is uninspired/ripping off other shows"" argument is unfounded or unhelpful. Basically, it tells you ""why  your time with this show when there are days worth of much better content that does the same exact thing in other shows"". It also explains the reviewer's reasons for disliking it. Was it my fault that I watched KonoSuba and therefore already got a better version of the same joke? Speaking of which want a good isekai comedy/parody? Watch Konosuba, both seasons, then watch them again, because watching the same good show a second time would still be more productive than watching this... ""thing"" once. Knight's & Magic of this year isn't a comedy nor is it great but it's world and characters ain't half bad. Watch that! Or Restaurant in another World (could be written better but it looks and feels nice).I have a real hard time believe as many casual anime viewers are enjoying this as much as they are. It doesn't even have that cute of girls, like Eromanga, to elevate it above its dumb characters. I don't mean to rain on their parade but I'm just saying I've seen enough anime to understand that given the standard level of quality that anime as a whole has to offer this is on the low level of quality side. The show's director has a talent for making bad scene transitions, lifeless character performances, uninspired editing, bad scene composition... the complaints truly do go beyond cries of ""ripoff"". And just because it's a silly pleasant show DO NOT THINK that excuses the show of being bad or underwhelming in these areas. When I watch my dumb distracting anime shows I still expect a base level of direction out of it.I guess it also doesn't do anything particularly offensive (aside from the animation and character design) but the fact that it does nothing new or original in an ocean of nothing and unoriginal anime is reason enough for me. Not saying reinvent the wheel with the genre, just don't s*** the bed with it.",5
in-another-world-with-my-smartphone,"Dude, so I only watched a couple episodes of both this and Konosuba. Although it is a little different, and the main character in Konosuba is of course the goddess, Konosuba (at first) and I guess Megumin? I looked it up because I don't fully know, all I know was she was introduced later on in the story.. Anyway, the main character in this is the dude with a phone. Either way, they both take place where a character dies and meets a god and reincarnates into a new self. I don't fully know which episode he thinks of them in slime, but its quite similar to KonoSuba, because I recall them having like the same episode. If you start to like this and have never watched KonoSuba, I recommend Konosuba first.. I feel as if KonoSuba just does a better job with animation and bits of their story.",5
in-another-world-with-my-smartphone,"This had the premise of being something cool but it turned super generic.He ends up in another world with only his smartphone and his clothes.  Has literally godlevel magic power and can ignore the normal limitations for null magic that applies to everyone.  God tells him polygamy is accepted in this world and he still doesn't understand all these women around him.  I use women lightly because one was like 12 and the others are probably around his age of 16.  Once he finds a way to interject himself into a woman's life they just cling to him.  Plans and ambitions were practically none existent after encountering him.  At one point he gets a big place, because it's a harem anime and you need somewhere to live with all your women, and he makes the decision for them to live with him.  The line was something along the lines of, ""This place is good for the 5 of us.""  They don't even question it or think for themselves.  First reaction was basically, ""Do you really mean it? Yay!""  Once it got to that point I gave up.  Especially since they were trying to establish him starting his harem with the 12 year old as the main wife.",3.5
in-another-world-with-my-smartphone,"Spoiler free!Review or TLDR at the end: The show is another generic taken to another world fantasy but it isn't bad. There is no real plot so it relies on it's polygamy accepting culture which allows MC to start a Harem and actually get somewhere with them! Not just be a teaser. Animation is what you would expect, shoddy lower end but it isn't bad, just really is not the focus. MC has his smartphone which he uses to take advantage of our modern science and understanding to do anything he wants. He is your average MC who is a total child with hormones and girls that are not sketchy but your FBI agent might shake his head. The pacing is wacky, plot points work but are just to keep the show going forward, yes it has a beach episode to be filler content, etc. Summary/ TLDR: Generic yet again, plot is laughable, harem, polygamy is A-Okay and the MC actually might get somewhere unlike other shows. And in some ways he does! Animation is eh. MC overpowered. Some humor is actually pretty good though. You got spare time to blow go ahead, just don't be too excited.",3.5
in-another-world-with-my-smartphone,"...and then you reach the last two episodes and realize that they pretty much just stuffed a full season's worth of fanservice into two episodes. *sigh*It started with some bland, easy to enjoy tropes which was okay due to the lack of overpowering sexuality. The protagonist is nice, clever, and interesting things happened. Then the last two episodes have the progression stop so that his harem can just force themselves on him while nothing of any meaning happens. It's super frustrating to see it end like that.",4
in-another-world-with-my-smartphone,"It's that but bad. The main character is a Mary Sue and I really don't like using that term. The Smartphone is more for a catchy title to the anime more than anything else. No one wants the title of their anime to be ""That Time I Got Reincarnated Overpowered and I Brought my Smartphone."" Slime gets away for comedic reason and because he has more personality than a brick. Buildings in Detroit get more development than this typical harem protagonist.EDITS:Also to people calling other Snobs because they think this isn't good, who's the real snob here? I'm not the one berating others for not liking something.I decided to go through another episode since I thought I was being a bit unfair and increased from 1 to 2 stars. The phone does manage to stay relevant. I think my biggest problem is that this main character is too much of a messiah. He can basically save anyone. He's powerful, can heal fatal wounds, blindness, teleport, trace assassins, probably cure cancer. Perhaps it's less so that he's overpowered but that he can do any and everything. Interesting characters' have flaws, it makes them more human. Saitama is constantly bored , possibly depressed, and very stupid. Ainz ironically has little human compassion and approaches life like a series of experiments. Speaking on Ainz he also has a full cabinet of pretty intelligent servants. Mob is physically weak, doesn't know how to make friends, and too kind for his own good(also a flaw to Vash from Trigun). This guy is lecherous at worst. Too perfect, too perfect.",4
in-another-world-with-my-smartphone,"It's a lighthearted show with no stakes, no drama, just literally a dude with god as his buddy walking over the world picking up a harem. It's inoffensive, and clearly doesn't want much thought put into it, however, it is entertaining, and that's what really matters. I think if people were to judge this from purely a formalist point of view, of course, it's a bad show. However, that doesn't mean it's unenjoyable, and for the most part, it's incredibly enjoyable if you're into this OP main isekai harem subgenre that's popped up.",3
in-another-world-with-my-smartphone,"I'm only giving this three stars even though my personal opinion is higher. Isekai in general are a guilty pleasure of mine.My favorite analogy for these type of shows is it's like cake. Cake is sweet and fun, but is not particularly nutritious and it's richness is artificially filling. It would be bad for you to eat excessive amounts of cake. If you eat too much cake you'll probably lose your taste for it. But despite all that, dang it all, sometimes you just want some cake.I do have one criticism. For a society that is supposedly pretty pro polygamy, why is the MC and his harem literally the only (potentially) polygamist relationship shown? Major plot hole there. Answer me that and stay fashionable.",3
in-another-world-with-my-smartphone,"while writing this review i'm on my 6th run of the anime and i still enjoy it very much it's simple in some areas but it's done so nicely i really hope for more seasons.  Over powered protagonist - checkRandom cute girls - checkMostly female cast - checktransported to a different world - checkThe list keeps going, but i think you get the point, the show so far isn't inherently bad, its just nothing new. Sure theres better anime, but theres also worse, the humor is amazing for what it is there is always a point i'll laugh at.",4
in-another-world-with-my-smartphone,"The protagonist is the classic harem lead: heart of a saint, power of a god, intuition of a gnat and unable to allow himself to fall for any one girl. I love the story idea of using a smartphone in another world but I really wish they had actually invested into it rather than use it as a new idea for yet another harem anime with extra focus on ""harem."" Whenever there is fighting the overpowered hero shuts it down in an instant but if there is typical, say, ""romantic mischief"" then emphasis on that with a dose of ""[Hero], you pervert!"" and ""I-I-I-It's not what you think!"" and the unspoken ""It IS what I think no matter what you or the truth says!""So if you can't get enough harem animes and their clichés, dive right in. If you want a show with a little more story than just clichés, keep looking.",2
in-another-world-with-my-smartphone,"There is not a lot of originality to it and while that's fine there also really isn't anything in particular to this anime that makes it shine over other ""Other World"" animes. With other animes in the genre like slime, konosuba, overlord etc. All of them have something unique that stands out, something you can go to your buds and say ""watch this anime for this reason"". So if you need something to binge as long as it's an anime, this would satisfy you but if you are looking for something to make you want to watch this anime i don't believe you are going to find it.",4
in-another-world-with-my-smartphone,"Overall, not terrible, but it does feel like this show was pieced together to make a quick buck in some sense. Yet, I still mostly enjoyed it for what it was.The animation isn't that great, but it isn't the worse I have ever seen in a show. The music is the same way pretty much just meh. Although, I will say that the opening song is rather catchy, The characters in this show feel as generic as tofu in some ways, but they are cute, so it does make it that much more enjoyable.The thing that is the weirdest about this show is that it feels like it was designed to be specifically enjoyed in western homes like in USA, Canada, Europe, and Australia (you know what I mean). I normally never think about this when it comes to pretty much every other anime I have watched in the past. Now, I don’t know if this is true. There are certain aspects to the show though that make it feel like a studio in Japan just wanted to do a quick cash grab to western audiences as they knew they know that we would eat it up. Does this mean it’s the worst show ever? No, it isn’t. Sure, it is lacking a major story, and some of the stuff is as generic as I do in my own home, but it keeps you interested in it as there are some interesting aspects to the show. There are only 12 episodes and trust me that is enough for this show. I doubt they will ever do a second season as I wouldn’t think there would be enough people interested in it to begin with. If you do decide to give it a watch, don’t feel bad if you don’t like it because this show definitely isn’t for everyone. Overall, could be worse, but also, could be better.",5
in-another-world-with-my-smartphone,"Absolutely loved this series. can see why a lot of people dislike it because everything goes very conviniently for the MC, but this is an almost perfect embodiment of what I like in books and in anime. Instead of the second hand embarassment I felt from watching Subaru mess up in RE:Zero, which by the way I loved too, it genuinely felt good when things went right for the MC. The story is not very deep but the show is really easy to sit down and watch.",4
in-another-world-with-my-smartphone,"I'm not sure exactly what is wrong with me, but I really enjoyed this show. It's your typical isekai with an absurdly powerful MC and a harem. There's barely any conflict, the world is a bit underdeveloped, there's no deep messages or meaning to be found, but it's just so damn lovable I can't help but want to watch it again and again. Perhaps it's just that the Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideHarem Ending is so rare and brings me such joy, and I'll admit I'm a bit of a simple man when it comes to liking the things I like. The entire show was comfy fun from start to finish, and I desperately need to see another 60 episodes immediately, though I do hope that if the show continues we will see the world itself fleshed out a lot better. That being said, it seems pretty likely that the MC is Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hidedead dead and the entire story is his Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hide Heaven, which gives the whole thing a darker vibe that also makes more sense cognitively. Either way, I adored this show, especially as a palate-cleanser after watching something heavier (Goblin Slayer before this myself). Furthermore, while I'd love more episodes, the ending of what we have so far satisfied me almost completely, which is an incredibly rare feat for any anime, especially a 12-episode one.",1
in-another-world-with-my-smartphone,"This show is a mess. But it is a mess in all the right ways! It is a total self-insert fantasy. If you can set aside any desire to take this show seriously, you'll have a lot of fun. Just ignore the absurdity and enjoy it for what it is. Someone's fantasy life. The MC is basically a god, he has his harem, every super power imaginable, the real god on speed dial and cute girls everywhere. Thankfully his harem isn't a bunch of mindless drones and all fairly distinct, if one dimensional, characters who can hold their own in their own rights. And an OP main character is always better than a useless one, especially in a harem. If you are bored, there are certainly worse ways to waste some time.Pros:Crazy over the top godly MCLots of cute girlsFun to watch Cons:The story is full of plot holesEverything is way to silly to every take seriously",3.5
in-another-world-with-my-smartphone,It's a nice change to the anime's that try to hard to be taken seriously it has a pretty ok story (though to get all of it you need to read the novels) that needs a few more episodes for you to get why the protagonist is as powerful as he is. (there is a good reason but it's not touched on in the anime.)it's pretty light hearted with a sense of humor that seems to not take anything seriously even itself. it's a nice anime to watch if you just want something less serious to watch after a serious or grim dark anime and it's the lighter side to some other in another world anime. And like i said it in no way takes it self serious and i think it works for this anime in particular. it was fun to sit and laugh at at the very least.,3.5
in-another-world-with-my-smartphone,"Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideThis anime has no feeling like other anime, I mean it is not that bad anime. I only recommend this anime if you have nothing to watch, if you feel so bored in the holidays and have nothing to watch.What I think watching this anime,Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hide I think this is funny for the first part, but after this anime gets so stupid. for example a normal person would get freaked out if they got thrown to another world with no idea what kind of world it is.I found the title so funny that is why I stared to watch this anime, and if you don't have anything to spend time with, would recommend you watching this anime.",5
in-another-world-with-my-smartphone,"This anime's pretty much pure garbage. The title says ""In Another World with my Smartphone,"" but really, the smart phone hardly plays a role outside of a convenient plot device.It's basically wish fulfillment to its core -- Nothing's a challenge, everything falls into the MC's lap, and he's able to solve any problem. Case in point: He comes across a coat that comes with some huge resistances, but the downside is that it doubles the damage taken by magic types the wearer can't use. The solution? Oh wait, he uses ALL types LOL. And that's not even the worst example.People will say ""Oh, the MC's OP, this is like One Punch Man!"" No, don't compare this to One Punch Man. Saitama's got more personality than this MC, and some could argue that One Punch Man is partially about the world and the other heroes as well (who are each far more interesting than the bland series of walking tropes this anime calls a ""harem"").""Oh, but this anime's like Konosuba!"" Please, get out of here with that. Konosuba's got a FAR better premise, MUCH more interesting characters, superior animation... I don't get how people even make the comparison. It's like taking a McDonald's hamburger and comparing it to a fillet mignon from Ruth Chris on basis that they're both ""beef.""This anime/""story"" was essentially a bunch of people sitting around and taking the most generic parts of isekai/harem storylines, putting them together, then making it extremely convenient so that everything gets solved at a moment's notice. It's lazy to the point of being disgusting.",5
in-another-world-with-my-smartphone,"This is one of the worse isekai anime I have suffered through.  Up (or is it down) there with death march to the parallel world rhapsody or Master of Ragnarock.  Lack of effort from the story, I mean .. it appears to be a work written by a committee, who was pulling ideas out of a hat.. harem with characters drawn to look ten, check,  special powers contained in a smartphone (cause the internet knows all).Nothing special about the characters.. just tropes.  Lead character with no personality. Only reason it doesn’t deserve a 1, is that it is pretty unoffensive compared to what it could have been.",5
in-another-world-with-my-smartphone,"The premise seemed silly, the main is quickly shown to be op op, there is an amount of ""fan-service"".It's enjoyable though, don't know why but after I started the first episode I felt an urge to get to know what happened next. I hope there's a next season.Animation: 8/10 - Sometimes things look a bit flat, the frame-rate feels a bit low sometimes (mostly during action sequences). The style is pleasant. Story: 8/10 - It's a decent story so far, pleasant if not a bit weird at times.Sound: 9/10 - Some voices don't quite fit their characters, other than that, it's decent.",1
in-another-world-with-my-smartphone,"Okay so I watched this show as the episodes were coming last year, and to be completely honest, I loved this show for what it is. At the time, this show seemed really decent and I knew that it may be too stereotypical or not much plot involved, but it kind of gave me a slice of life vibe. It's a type of show that would be great to pick up if you want something that's light and not too emotion heavy or impactful, just for the enjoyment/laughter!! Also Kohaku (the white tiger/cat) is so adorable and the voice for her is too cute!",1
in-another-world-with-my-smartphone,I have watched this anime and have read the web novels since it first came out.  I think it is amazing and has a bit of everything that a reader could like. The anime is only the tip of the iceberg to so many great plots and arcs that you could easily create another 3 seasons for this show.  I truly hope this isn't just another good anime that got its 12 episodes and and then moved on. Please try to continue it if possible.,3
in-another-world-with-my-smartphone,"Now its no 5 star anime but it isn't terrible, if you're a person who hold characters as the defining moment i think you'll like this anime. It should be labled a Slice of Life because thats all it is, if you go into this expecting some fantastic story then ignore that, it simply Mary Sue gets a Harem The Anime. The main character is a nice guy and the girls like him for that, hes incredibly OP basically if you put god into a 15 year old's body, thats what he is in this world. So basically dont watch this if you care about a:StoryAmazing PlotPacingClever WritingBecause it doesnt existWatch this if you:Like characters more than anythingLike EcchiLike HaremLike Magic Fantasy WorldsDont care about storyLove slice of life",3
in-another-world-with-my-smartphone,"This first 10 minutes of the episode pretty much perfectly explains the premise of the show. Main character is brought to another world blessed with enhanced abilities due to divine intervention/mistakes. The twist in this one is it's one of the first animes to have the main character keep his smartphone as well. Magicially enchanted as well of course.Overall... it's easy to see why a majority of people love it or at least enjoyed it. Clean animation, a decent flow in dialogue and decent if not some strong moments of Voice Acting with some okay action or at least some nice payoff moments. The characters are likable though they are the standard fair of the harem genre. Very much by the book and general hits more then misses. Decent VA work even if the writing itself is a bit bland at parts.Why the series sits at a bit average or why some people didn't enjoy it probably lies in the writing, noticeable moments of poor animation and the lost in direction after episodes 4 or 5. The series does start of pretty strong in building the world and fleshing out its characters. It also ends on some pretty strong notes too. Probably the thing that hurts the series is the middle part. Unfortunately the character development stalls out for a good chunk of the series as the focus seems to be more on the group's growth in size rather then as people and a weird mix of slice of life but story elements to something grander. After shaping out our main protag as the OP character that he is, it just stops for him. The show even stops with harem premise for a while and it really does feel like the main character just happens to run into girls a lot rather then there being some level of attachment between the characters outside of ""oh, the main character is really nice"". The girls do get a bit more development during the middle episodes but for the most part, the character development just gets lost as does the story as it just goes through the motion even though it's not sure where its trying to go. Animation also starts to stagnant a bit. It remains very clean throughout but can be pretty stiff and uninteresting at times. In some of the action moments is where this is most noticeable. Rushed sequences, stiff animations, poor flow, and just some uninteresting camera work and angles. The last couple of episodes is where the series seems to find itself again. The harem and girls' character develop get fleshed out more and the main character starts having signs of a personality. But it feels a bit abrupt and forced since there was such a void in the character development until the last 3 or so episodes. At times it feels like the series was shying away from falling into its genre's troupe but then after discovering it didn't know where to go from there, went back into its roots and found itself at the end. The series sits at point where you feel the studio and team learned a lot and you're kind of excited if they can do better with a season 2 but at the same time, you aren't surprised it still hasn't gotten a 2nd season yet if it will at all.",3
in-another-world-with-my-smartphone,"bad show is bad. bad development, shitty waifus, incoherent story, no conflict, op blank canvas protagonist. another bland isekai sandwich on white bread with mayo. Honestly i dont know why i continue to watch isekais anymore. I mean i dont even like anime. I have watched so much bullshit that i am jaded to all of it. yes i watched through all of it, yes i was most likely drunk, yes this show is bad. not funny not entertaining. id rather watch soa again. season 2.",3
in-another-world-with-my-smartphone,"Like danmachi, I saw it and slept on it. Looking through shows to watch I decided to give this anime a shot. While at times some cringe moments, very much enjoyed the series and will be looking forward to another season hopefully. Animation was good, some good laughs aswell with a main character who is honestly abit generic but still a worthwhile watch if you're bored and have nothing else to watch.",3
in-another-world-with-my-smartphone,"I really enjoyed this even if it's pretty basic. Guy jumps into new world, bumps into a girl in trouble (in this case he started with 2), helps them out, ends up saving a kingdom, repeat. Originally I had planned not to watch it but I had hopes it was a prequel to another anime. After the first episode I realized my mistake. This is more suited for teenage girls and wishful thinking boys. The art style was very good and the ecchi stuff that seemed to be more demanding towards the end of the season was a good laugh but obvious fan service.",3.5
in-another-world-with-my-smartphone,"The overall plot isn't that good with most of the focus of the anime being on the relationships the main character builds. While the plot isn't that strong the theme of the anime is pretty standard for a over powered main character anime while still being unique in it's own right. The overall rating of this show wouldn't be higher than a 4 star because the plot is just lacking too much, there is a sense of what's going to happen in the future but it just seems like a sidebar thing.",3.5
in-another-world-with-my-smartphone,"This is a fairly entertaining harem anime. Overall, it does what it tries to accomplish. It is one of the better harems I have seen. It isn't really an action filled anime, but rather, a lighthearted anime with magic and other adventure elements that will entertain you for a while. My only gripe is that Touya is way too overpowered. In my opinion, Konosuba is a bit better at this concept, but this is a good harem anime overall.",2
in-another-world-with-my-smartphone,"Seriously, it gets worse as time goes on. In the beginning, you don't expect to get the whole thing. But around episode 5, I realised that there was no real conflict. Everything was so easy, and to quote the main character himself, ""Wow. That's convenient.""Also, there are at least 3 plot lines that are never cleaned up. It makes me think there was originally going to be more episodes, but the executives had to cut some out.",2
in-another-world-with-my-smartphone,"Main character is blatantly, boringly overpowered.  The harem and fan service is a bit overdone.  There isn't much of a plot.  The part about God is wildly insulting.  The smartphone part is almost tacked on instead of being an important part of the series.And yet, I watched all of first season, so I didn't hate it completely.  But on the other hand, I only watched it because I had nothing else to watch.",5
