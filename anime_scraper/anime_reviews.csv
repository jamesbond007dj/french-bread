my-hero-academia,"It is Here! This is the future of the Shonen genre. The bringer of the next generation. The creator of Naruto even promoted the series and said it was the real deal. It takes a profound and unique spin on the genre and has solid characters, an intriguing story and a fantastic soundtrack. Studio Bones is doing an excellent job with the adaptation as well. As a manga reader I'm very much looking forward to the future of this series.",5
my-hero-academia,"SHORT VERSION: This is one of the most thrilling and delightful anime of its era. It's even healthy for your brain. Just watch it.Some shows are solid but dull; some shows are enjoyable but unsubstantial. This series is solid enough but manages to be one of the most energetic, enjoyable viewing experiences I've ever had. I would not consider it the best anime ever made, but I might consider it the most flat-out enjoyable I've seen yet. The story is solid, the character designs quirky (obligatory pun)  and memorable, the music phenomenal (courtesy of Yuki Hayashi), but there's just a special soul to this one that elevates it above its peers. I was skeptical at first as it seemed like a somewhat cliche setup. In true shonen fashion, it spent a little while training up and then proceeded to completely obliterate my expectations. It took what I thought would be a tired story and breathed an overwhelming passion and life into it. It's filled to the brim with energy and heart, giving feels and frissons continually. It exemplifies the best of shonen: its messages of tenacity, crazy characters, thrilling battles, and sense of progression. It also avoids many of the problems typically associated with the genre, with (typically) better pacing and consistently spectacular animation. Studio Bones taking seasonal breaks between arcs to give them the time they deserve really gives this show an edge on its other cousins.Oh, and studies show that watching series where characters you identify overcome and win is actually healthy for your brain. Turns out, that thrilling feeling you get when your favorite character does something awesome or pushes through is your brain releasing certain chemicals to match them. And I've never seen a show that so consistently make me wanna stand up and cheer. This might be the most motivational thing you'll ever watch. NOW, GO BEYOND! PLUS ULTRA!",5
my-hero-academia,"Had you ever found your favorite anime was ended because they didn't make enough rating or out of budget? This is the one i'm actually hoping for that not to happen. I'd buy the whole company and the writer to make this to the last episode, non-stop. Soundtrack was very entertaining and really spot on with the main theme. Character developing quite slow, but then when its reach the momentum, it will start rolling fast.",5
my-hero-academia,"Potential SpoilersMinor spoilers from Season 1.Mentions of Season 2 with no context.Gently explained character personalities if that counts as spoiling.The BuildupThis show highlights the benefits of being a strong devout follower of improvement, and incredibly hypes up the audience (it had definitely hyped me up) with Midoriya's efforts. Emphasized by All Might's admiration, the fact that Midoriya was able to perfectly clear the beach alone truly built the character whom wants to move forward despite being told that he cannot. Instead of sitting back in admiration, he chases his dreams to become higher than those he admires because it sets him further in his goal to become a hero. Midoriya as a character motivates the idea of improving by visualizing the power of aspiration as he eliminates his obstacles; he moves forward and trains himself despite being ridiculed by his classmates and Bakugo, who he looked up to, in the first half of Season 1. Furthermore, Midoriya successfully demonstrates his purpose of being a hero: to help others, especially during the entrance exam, and especially during the attack of the villains.The buildup of Midoriya's character in this show is very consistent and while it may be slightly cliche, it doesn't get old, not to mention how Midoriya doesn't have those cringy motivational scenes like many other main characters from other anime who have similar goals.Ratings if I were to be honest:Characters: 10/10Midoriya's character is especially well done, and the same can be said for the secondary characters such as Bakugo, Ochaco, Iida, and Todoroki. As far as the characters with a significant impact to the story, their development is spot-on in my opinion. Even side characters have consistent and lovable personalities.Story: 9/10 The story accompanies the other aspects of the show with a decent storyline. The main character has a goal to achieve that he cannot naturally complete like his peers, but continues to try and gets closer to succeeding. The main character also somehow moves forward despite the drawbacks. I think this is slightly cliche, but original stories tend to be harder to come by with the more shows and stories that come out each year, so the rating doesn't lose more than one point. I think the key to having a good story isn't about originality, but the execution of the story. Midoriya succeeds a lot by chance, again like most other characters, but he acknowledges that and takes it as his own responsibility to improve despite the positive outcomes (Shown in Season 2, you'll know what I mean when I say this). So his advancement isn't just pure nonsense, but it's explained throughout. Also, he doesn't randomly control his powers one time but then fails the other times. For example, he throws with the power of one finger, but still breaks his finger, and his perfect punch was luck, but the circumstances were well explained later.Voice Acting: 10/10I really love how the voices easily match the speaker's personality. Bakugo has an aggressive way of speaking, emphasizing superiority and arrogance, whereas Midoriya speaks lightly with a slight submission, emphasizing caution and awkwardness.Art/Design: 10/10 The art is fairly high quality and consistent, there are rarely any misplaced details or disproportion.In ConclusionAltogether, I know that, even without reading the manga, this anime is definitely going far. Season 2 is already very promising, and I look forward to seeing the rest of this anime through.",5
my-hero-academia,"Ok so I kept saying I wouldn't watch this show because I wasn't crazy about the animation.....but...finally after everyone wouldn't shut up about it, I decided to give it a go. I was hooked by episode one, of course. Just like famous anime protagonists Naruto, Gon, etc., Midoriya is a character that you just can't help but fall in love with. The other characters are developing well too and the fights are awesome. I can't wait to see Midoriya grow as a character. I definitely recommend.",5
my-hero-academia,"I was browsing C.R. for kicks and I saw this one and figured, okay, I'll give it a shot. I had heard zero about the manga and zero about the show, so this was a fresh new world to delve into. Three days in and I finished up season 2 ep 21 and I'm eager for more. Easy binge and easy to get hooked on. Good storytelling and characters that are likeable. There's nothing about this show I don't like. Everything seems to flow well in the episodes and I'm generally interested in the backstories of characters. Well worth the watch.",5
my-hero-academia,"If ""X-men"" and ""Sky High"" had a Japanese love-child, this would be it. With high schools for teens with superpowers called ""quirks"" training to become heroes and fight bad dudes.If you like:- Goofy characters- Fun, typical, cheezy storyline- BADASS fight scenes- A nerdy main character who cries a LOT but fights like a BEAST- and UNITED STATES OF SMASH!Then you'll love this anime. Plus Ultra.",5
my-hero-academia,"Does an anime have to be completely original, to be a masterpiece? Should the story be unpredictable for it to be good?I don't think so.There is beauty in simplicity.The portrayal of every single component of the specific fictional world is the most important point in creating a series.Despite having your typical shounen, (young boy has a dream he wants to achieve so he has to overcome many obstacles on its way despite being an underdog in comparison to many other characters) this series does everything right so far. It does not try to hard with its plot, but still offers a big cast of interesting characters and a story where you can understand and share your feelings with the protagonist.Reaching episode 34, this work woke my feels more than any other series I have seen yet.  The solid art and the emotion generating sounds make a great deal of a this simple, yet for me perfect story.",5
my-hero-academia,"I admit, I was extremely skeptical about this anime. I saw the 5 star reviews, I heard it was recommended by the creator of Naruto but when I saw the art and the first episode, I just didn't get it. I could not have been more wrong.This is...Sky High (old movie some may remember) meets X-Men. Its an incredible story with great characters and although the animation isn't always the best, the fights are really fun to watch unfold. The story is unfolding perfectly and character development is being handled expertly. I can't wait to watch more and I recommend this to anyone. An easy 5 Stars.",5
my-hero-academia,"I got my brother, who doesn't like anime, to get hooked on this! Had him hooked on it since season 1 was released.. That should be enough to make you want to watch it already. This will instantly become one of your favorites if not #1. We are both super excited for Season 4! PLUS ULTRA!Every character in this series is so ""Quirky"" that brings a special individualism to each one :P. The story leaves you in great suspense and theories just keep popping into your head. This was a genius setup as the author can literally do ANYTHING he wants this story. Still the great feel as most of the top shonen, but in a world so unique and an MC that draws out your emotions. This series would turn a lot of non-anime watchers into fans..Enjoy~",5
my-hero-academia,"i went to store and started walking down the pristine aisles, i noticed a small jar with the word ""happiness"" written on the side. I picked up the jar and brought it to the counter, i payed for it and went to the parking lot.In the parking lot i opened the jar and inside was the most beautiful thing i had ever seen, it was Darling In The Franxx. But yeah bnha is very good 10/10 would recommend",5
my-hero-academia,"My Hero Academia.This series has sat in my queue for a couple months before I got around to trying it out.I'm a bit angry at myself for not giving this series a chance for so long. Lately, I've been watching many low quality series leaving me with bitter disappointment in anime in general. To have let this sit in my queue for so long is unforgivable.Simply put, it is amazing. I haven't had these gleeful feelings since first watching Naruto back in the early 2000's. It is a must watch. A required watch.If you're unsure of the series and have let it sit in your queue as well, I highly recommend watching the first four episodes. I guarantee by the end of the fourth, you'll be spurred forward in wanting to see how everything unfolds.Come, Young Midoriya. This is your hero academia!I get goosebumps and a little teary eyed just thinking about that ending. The music was in sync and just perfect.10/10 Go beyond, plus ultra!",5
my-hero-academia,"Through season 3, I can confidently say this is the best shonen I have ever watched. The voice acting is incredible, especially from Deku in the Muscular fight. The animation is also incredible. I love their take on developing their characters and quirks. There was only one pointless/filler episode in 3 seasons so far. A lot of shonen are packed with them. The music scores are also incredible. They will stick in your head. I am looking forward to the future of this series.",5
my-hero-academia,"At first glance, this show seems like just one more addition to a sub-genre flooded with clichés.  DON'T LET IT FOOL YOU.  My Hero Academia takes this sort of story to the next level, consistently surpassing my expectations and getting me more invested in an anime than I've been in years.  Instead of inverting the tropes shonen is known for, this show surrounds and supports them with elegant scaffoldings of motivations and plot points that change the tone of the old, familiar tale from tired to thrilling and remind us that it's the details that make or break a show.  In particular, I'm impressed by the creator's ability to keep all the characters' differing motivations in mind and ensure that they always act in accordance with what's driving them.  This is a very powerful storytelling tool and one that's, sadly, often subsumed into the ""hive mind"" in typical large-cast anime.  This show not only avoids that trap, it somehow keeps the viewer aware of each character's perspective, even in ensemble scenes, which leads to an extremely rich viewing experience.My Hero Academia is by far the best example of its kind that I've seen.  It's ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"" as sung by Whitney Houston.  I'm so, so glad I gave it a chance.",4
my-hero-academia,"Usually I don't like a lot of animes and am found very picky when it comes to the shows I like but HOLLY CRAP THIS ANIME IS GOOD! So far, this anime has pretty solid character backgrounds and designs and even a well crafted plot. Truly, out of all the episodes and seasons so far, my favorite has to be season two and I am expecting get intentions to this anime. I want to refer this anime to Naruto: a simple underdog who fights his way to the top of the charts and this series shows one of the best origin stories I have ever seen/hear. This anime gives me a lot of motivation to fight towards my goal and to overall be happy with the things that you have been blessed within your life!",5
my-hero-academia,"Let me start off with saying that this show is amazing. Boku no Hero Academia, or rather My Hero Academia is the new hot shounen series. This show gets a lot of things right, but it's not perfect either. The first season was rather slow and didn't really introduce us to the characters, but trust me when I say this - the second season totally made up for that problem. The characters were all amazing, and especially one character finally got his time to shine. Our main character Izuku or Deku (whatever you wanna call him) still amazes me, he is not the typical ""whiny"" character, and I can't wait to see him develop even more. The animation was done by well known studio Bones, also known for other popular shows like Fullmetal Alchemist and Noragami. The animation was good, but it was kinda expected I guess? For the music we currenly have 3 openings, and all 3 are amazing (even though my favorite is the second one, Peace  Sign) but I never felt like there was any piece in the soundtrack that stood out to me, maybe my taste in music is just bad?I have conflicted feelings on this show, because I feel like it is too ""over hyped"", I see why it's great, but I wouldn't go out of my way to say this is like a gift from god. I did enjoy this show a lot and I do recommend it. If you like action then what are you waiting for? Therefore, I rate Boku no Hero Academia a solid 7,88 out of 10 and recommend you to watch the heck out of this show. (Please accept that this is my opinion, so don't feel offended in any way, thank you for understanding.)",5
my-hero-academia,"My Hero Academia has delved into some dangerous territory:Multi-episode fightsTournament arcsMain characters that are introduced very lateAnd NEVER ONCE was is boring or cliche.When I found out that season two of this show would heavily focus on a singular tournament I was ready to begin crawling out of my skin as I watched episode after episode of the same two days or so and god did this show come in clutch. The tournament arc was amazing and fun and I was actually sad when it ended. The fight scenes are long, but never dull which makes them a pleasure to watch. The characters all have interesting and captivating backstories and motivations.Nothing in this show has disappointed me and, from the way things are going, I don't think anything will.",5
my-hero-academia,"I've been told by my sister and a friend about this show, and to be honest, I can't remember the last time I was so thrilled and engaged into a fictional world that I would watch it (almost) non-stop, and then pick up the manga and get up to date with the events. It could have been when I read The Count of Monte Cristo, or the Sherlock Holmes stories for the first time; all I gotta say is that My Hero Academia is one of the best shows I have ever seen. The characters are well built, the story is immersive and the soundtrack is bonkers.",5
one-piece,"Don't let the odd art style or ridiculous number of episodes deter you from watching this masterpiece. There will never be a boring moment. You will experience some of the greatest laughs and feels from this series. Just when you think you have the characters figured out, they surprise you. Oda never forgets a single one of the characters that he creates and neither will you. You don't just watch One Piece. You live it alongside the crew as they sail on the open seas on their grandiose adventure.",4.5
one-piece,"One Piece can simply be defined as: constant adventure. It has a truly amazing cast of characters that you will come to love as you learn about their stories and watch them grow. One Piece is a fantastic adventure with epic fight scenes, imaginative characters, wild landscapes, and unforgettable music. You will laugh, cry, feel anger, sadness, and joy as you make your way through the Straw Hats' epic quest. This is the story of Monkey D. Luffy becoming the King of the Pirates.",5
one-piece,"One Piece is simply the greatest anime of all time. When I first read Crunchyroll was adding it to their streaming library, I thought it was a joke, too good to be true. Then, after making sure that no one was pulling some sort of cruel prank on me I jumped for joy. One Piece combines every aspect of an amazing anime into it one ultimate experience for anyone who enjoys the medium. Every character is perfect, well developed, and gets their moment in the spotlight at least once, no matter how minor. One Piece can do anything it wants to, seamlessly transitioning from a comedy into a tear jerker in the space of one episode. I could go on for hours about the level of absolute perfection this show has achieved, but I'll keep myself contained and end at this: WATCH IT. YOU WILL HAVE NO REGRETS.",5
one-piece,"This anime is a pretty long series. I have watched countless hours of this anime and i must say it just keeps getting better. At first the animations are a little weak and they look pretty young but with the ""new world"" look they look clean cut and older. This anime does a great job on character developement you will come to know the whole crews past life experiences and is a great anime to watch. For me 5/5",5
one-piece,"It only took me a couple of months to watch 600+ episodes of the master peice of an anime+less fillers; unlike Naruto, there are significantly less fillers in one piece, and when there are fillers, they are at least entertaining or/and they add to character development and the plot +Likable characters: The characters are interesting and likable, theses are the characters that you actually want to see succeed and win the battle!+Good story: The story is interesting and keeps you hooked in! you always want to watch more after the episode ends+Humor: Contains moment that will have you laugh out loud form laughter-the only downside is that it is a little long and might be imitating for beginners, but i encourage you try this great anime! 5/5 -""ITS A MASTER PIECE""-Dunkey",5
one-piece,"One Piece is a classic, the anime has lasted over 13 years, why has it lasted so long?One of the reasons is the characters, all of the characters have a touching backstory, you get attached to them and want them to succeed. They help people, they joke around, they struggle, they grow, the characters are truly what makes One Piece a show you want to watch. The story is another reason people continue to watch it, who hasn't dreamed of adventure and exploring? He wants to be pirate king and because of that he gets to meet people and have fun and change the world. He's not stuck abiding by the law when the law is wrong, he does what is right and that leads to a lot of trouble often. But we cheer him on because he's doing the right thing, much like people like Batman, he does what is right in his own way. The battles are another reason One Piece has continued so long, Oda comes up with fantastic Devil Fruit powers, which lead to thrilling fights. Sometimes the abilities are silly, other times they are just plain terrifying. Seeing how Luffy and the crew deal with their new adversaries and try to save people, makes the show so addictive to watch. Now that I've covered some of the good things about the series, I will mention the cons.The series starts off with a lackluster art style, as expected for most older anime shows, the characters (definitely not talking about Ussop /sarcasm) can be annoying at times, and there is the typical anime fact there is always a stronger opponent. Basically if you like shonen anime, you will probably like this show, if you like more mature and serious anime (seinen anime) then this probably won't be for you.",5
one-piece,"I have been watching one piece ever since I saw it first air on 4kids TV and Toonami. I have kept up with it throughout the years and must say it is a great anime. However I feel as of late that the anime has begun to become extremly drawn out. I don't know if it is my imagination but I don't remember the series taking so long to progress. I mean lately it appears as if what could be accomplished in one or two episodes in the past, is now three, four, or even five episodes. Do not mistake, however, and think that I do not like this anime. Besides the long, drawn out episodes, this anime has it all: action, comedy, adventure, amazing fight scenes, and heart wrenching moments Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hidewhen they change ships for those of you who know what I mean.Though there is one other problem I do have with this anime. This is mainly directed to those of you who have seen past episode.... 500 or so? If you have not seen past that part I do not recomend opening the following spoiler, and will instead say that some of the anime's aesthetics have changed negatively IMO.  Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideAfter the bear dude (can't remember his name) pushed all the crew members around the world I feel as if I do not like the apparel or looks of some of the crew members anymore. While zoro, sanji, and ussop received some well deserved badass upgrades (maybe ussops's wasn't so well deserved, but oh well). I don't feel right when I look at all the other characters. Robin looked so much better before the time skip and both her and nami appear to have received a boob job sometime within the last three years. Also I don't quite like how chopper and ""soul king"" have become so.... plush... Lastly, I understand why they did it to franky but I can't stand looking at him now. I feel as if they went a little overboard on ""cyborging"" him up. Thank you for taking the time to read my review. I hope it was helpful.",5
one-piece,"Alot of people including myself were really skeptical about starting one piece, for me the main reason was the art. I really didn't like it at all. But I ended up watching it anyhow and in the end I fell in love with it.The anime has fantastic characters, and awesome story lines, and the best part unlike Naruto or bleach there is almost no filler in one piece. Not to mention One Piece is one of the most popular anime's in japan. You would be doing yourself a favor to start watching this show.Even if you don't want to start a long series, just watch at least 1 episode a day and you won't regret it!",5
one-piece,"Amazing that its been 15years running now. I loved it from the beginning, and to be honest would not mind seeing it go for many more years. It really only feels like we've made it only a bit over half way through the tale, and its never been a dull moment.<Possible semi-Spoilers in the following paragraph>Its been absolutely a trip watching the characters grow and see them each follow their dreams. Its not only about finding One Piece, its about becoming the greatest Swordsman and finding All Blue. It's about drawing the greatest World Map, becoming a Brave Man of the Sea and all of the others' dreams too. This really is the quintessential anime, the one japanese animation series with it all and for the whole family (almost). The world should be One Piece!",5
one-piece,"I'll list the bad aspects first as a warning, but there is definite merit in the good aspects of this series as well--which I list second. :)The BadDo NOT start watching this anime unless you realize first that there is a fairly large chance that it will end inconclusively. It has been running for almost 17 years (more if you've followed the manga) without having 17 years worth of plot to accompany it. The latest arc was 2+ years (3+ if you include the preface). Thing is, the pacing is slow because the anime industry feeds off that money and purposely encourages writers to make it that way (also the reason why Naruto Shippuden refuses to end despite the completion of the manga). For One Piece, there is an ending in sight, but the author (Oda) predicts it's about 10 years away--that's a 27 year series. Most who affectionately started watching this series in 1999 will be likely in their 40's by then with no time to actually watch the episodes as time and life take over. Even more, with Oda's health always in and out of question, there is even a chance that Oda may not be able to complete the series or may rush to create a quick end that may leave strings undone. Even more, some of the iconic voice actors are getting really elderly as well... (For example, Luffy's voice actor is 63+ years old and will be 70+ years old at the time of Oda's predicted ending; Brook and Franky's voice actors are about 60 as well). As sad as it is to say it (and I really hope it doesn't happen, obviously), but it's possible that some of them may not make it to the grand finale--which may mean having to adjust to new voice acting at some of the most crucial parts of the story. I mean, there is only one person who can voice Luffy and Franky. They're very unique voices.The GoodThat being said, One Piece is by far one of the most original stories I have seen in a while. The story itself is funny, tragic, adventurous, and actually really interesting. Even characters you suspect you might not like initially find a way to somehow worm their way into your hearts. The animation drastically changes from the first episode to the current one--but the change is so subtle over time that you don't realize it's happening until you go back and look. The bond that the crew has for their odd and mischievous captain is also very emotional at times--but definitely doesn't form overnight. Luffy has to painstakingly earn their trust, and once he has it, he enriches it through their adventures in search for the infamous ""One Piece."" What's also refreshing is that the crew over time learns that they can't always expect Luffy to take on the full burden of their adventures--that he will literally die or do things that shorten his life to protect those he cares for. So, they, they grow stronger to protect him as well. This is so refreshing from the standard single-character powerhouse who never needs assistance, and strengthens the characters' bond throughout the series--especially later when Luffy faces one of the greatest tragedies of his life that (for a short time) threatens to break his care-free spirit. In ConclusionSince I am VERY picky about the quality of anime I view, I'll admit that this is one of the more enjoyable series I have watched (other favorites being things like Gintama, Lupin III, Yu Yu Hakusho, and Cowboy Bebop--though albeit each very different from one another). I've really enjoyed it, but recently life has begun to get in the way and I find that I grow tired of waiting years for arcs to clear. Lately especially, it takes some enjoyment out of it--especially with the pacing of the last arc. But, if you are just starting out, it's easier to watch because you can skip repetitious shots and unnecessary flashbacks without fear of catching up too soon--though admittingly, the growing number of episodes is often intimidating for many potential viewers. In truth, I may have never started watching this series myself if I had realized it was the Never-Ending-Story. While I don't regret it, I do fear sadly that it will likely end up being cancelled before completion if Oda's health continues to remain poor or if they drag it out 10 more years as Oda suggested.",4
one-piece,"And now I'm borderline obsessed with this story and where it goes. Don't let a first glance at the unconventional art style put you off; it will never seem out of place once you start it up. Oda masterfully has OP take itself very seriously while not taking itself seriously in the slightest, simultaneously and it works! The world building is fantastic, character designs are unforgettable, and while the story becomes increasingly complex, it never feels convoluted. Its core themes are friendship, loyalty, and the relentless pursuit of one's dreams, but it also creatively tackles issues such as racism, classism, government corruption, religion, etc. Even the fillers are interesting! What are you waiting for?",5
one-piece,"I'm not sure why I'm just writing a review now, since One Piece has been my favorite shounen anime since many years ago. I discovered One Piece much later than Naruto and Bleach, but it became my favorite instantly--the story, the adventure, the characters, the humor, everything sets it apart from the other well-known shounen titles. Please, if you haven't tried watching One Piece due to the how long it is, I guarantee you'll catch up in no time. You'll binge watch it without even trying to!",4.5
one-piece,"The show speaks in many ways to all the age groups. I'm 25 and I can say it gladly that I'm a better person because of this show. The storyline and OST are unbelievably amazing. It's currently at 872 episodes and I don't think even 30% of the story is done. If you are looking for a show that will still be going for the next 5 years or maybe a decade, this is it.The only negative I can think of is the fan service that the show started focusing. I'm alright with it and sure it is distracting at some points but you can overlook it or enjoy it, that is up to you.",4.5
one-piece,"Although a very good manga I must say there are quite a few flaws in the anime, for one the animation is off at times... the animation takes off of the emotion the scene is supposed to emit with funny faces and cheesy lines, in some of the scenes im like what sonnn... for example the most memorable one is when in the Marineford Arc where luffy is losing his mind when ace dies the animation of that scene is just horrible in every sence luffys eyes go blank and his mouth is opened wide, it almost looks comical, for me a lot of the emotion that was supposed to be shown just goes away.I enjoy the anime a lot though its a bit tedious and a lot of the times the filler episodes get in the way of the whole story.",5
one-piece,"I began watching this anime to satisfy my nostalgia from when I was younger but as I continued watching I noticed that it started to touch me on levels that I thought long gone at the age of 22, I found myself experiencing emotions while watching the anime that were as strong as and if not, stronger than my emotional reaction to events in real life. This whole anime is an exploration of Oda's mind, these characters are Oda's best friends and he knows them better than anyone. The consistency of the writing is phenomenal, the constant and natural-feeling development of the characters is oddly comforting, the broad spectrum of humour goes beyond the boundaries of cultures and languages, and Luffy... I am struggling to find words befitting to describe him... This anime is Oda's Ode to Luffy, every episode will get you one step closer to understanding Luffy, understanding yourself and understanding why the hell Zoro can't follow simple directions.",5
one-piece,"Simply the best anime I have ever seen or will ever see in my life. I have watched countless anime in my lifetime including the big three (Naruto, Bleach, One Piece). Hands down the best thing I have ever seen. At first glance by reading the synopsis what you would get from this anime is just another Shonen action manga that happens to be about pirates and features interesting details such as a super treasure named ""One Piece"" and powers derived from so called ""Devil' Fruits. However it is so much more. This show has every genre you can think of. Any story-line you know will and can be used by the masterful Eiichiro Oda and his team. One Piece offers so much content, virtually anyone willing to put in the time can enjoy this show. This show knows how to evoke just the right emotion when it wants to. It explores and dives into every type of genre that exists while still staying true to it's premise of pirates and super powers and lots of action. It also delivers elsewhere. Whether it be debating morality, touching on romance, exploring sci-fi concepts or even traditional themes it executes all gracefully and masterfully wanting more each and every episode you watch. As of July 13th, 2016, with 749 episodes, 13 Movies, 12 TV Specials, 4 OVA's, and 4 Featurette's and only more and more to come with no end in sight this truly massive and global anime and manga are what put this series as my number 1. Eiichiro Oda began writing One Piece in 1996 and it is still going strong and more popular than ever in 2016. The author stated he has already planned and known the ending of the show since the beginning and all we have to do is live the journey with him. If you are a fan of life itself you will like this show. If you like anime, you will like this show. If you like Pirates, you will like this show. If you like intense action and over-the-top battles, you will like this show. If you are a fan of sincere heartfelt moments you will like this show. This show will make you feel every kind of emotion known. This show deserves every ounce of popularity it gets and I thank Eiichiro Oda for his selfless service to mankind. This is my favorite anime of all time and I recommend everyone to watch it regardless of age because all will enjoy. Don't be intimidated by it's size you can watch in any speed, form, or manner. But beware once you start you will never be able to stop. This is our modern day Iliad and we get to live through every moment. I cannot recommend this enough 5/5",5
one-piece,"this is mainly my favorite show, because there is so much to it. the story is amazing, the characters are awesome,[especially luffy!!!!] it has pirates,[also if you don't want the story spoiled a bit don't read anymore you get the gist that's its awesome]  it has swords eating devil fruits, it has GUNS eating devil fruits, I mean what does this show not have???                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             plus its made by SHOUNEN, in my opinion and almost everyone else's its the best SHOUNEN anime. Everyone who doesn't like it NEEDS TO LIKE IT, TRUST ME, it has everything you want and the main character is mega awesome i mean who cant like luffy???[I think he'll be the strongest anime character ever, knowing Oda, and yes I know there is a lot of other really strong anime characters but trust me hell be omega strong soon]everyone whos reading this needs to watch the show now or soon, trust me you'll fall in love with this show in seconds its just amazing/awesome .",5
