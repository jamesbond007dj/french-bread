my-hero-academia,"It is Here! This is the future of the Shonen genre. The bringer of the next generation. The creator of Naruto even promoted the series and said it was the real deal. It takes a profound and unique spin on the genre and has solid characters, an intriguing story and a fantastic soundtrack. Studio Bones is doing an excellent job with the adaptation as well. As a manga reader I'm very much looking forward to the future of this series.",5
my-hero-academia,"SHORT VERSION: This is one of the most thrilling and delightful anime of its era. It's even healthy for your brain. Just watch it.Some shows are solid but dull; some shows are enjoyable but unsubstantial. This series is solid enough but manages to be one of the most energetic, enjoyable viewing experiences I've ever had. I would not consider it the best anime ever made, but I might consider it the most flat-out enjoyable I've seen yet. The story is solid, the character designs quirky (obligatory pun)  and memorable, the music phenomenal (courtesy of Yuki Hayashi), but there's just a special soul to this one that elevates it above its peers. I was skeptical at first as it seemed like a somewhat cliche setup. In true shonen fashion, it spent a little while training up and then proceeded to completely obliterate my expectations. It took what I thought would be a tired story and breathed an overwhelming passion and life into it. It's filled to the brim with energy and heart, giving feels and frissons continually. It exemplifies the best of shonen: its messages of tenacity, crazy characters, thrilling battles, and sense of progression. It also avoids many of the problems typically associated with the genre, with (typically) better pacing and consistently spectacular animation. Studio Bones taking seasonal breaks between arcs to give them the time they deserve really gives this show an edge on its other cousins.Oh, and studies show that watching series where characters you identify overcome and win is actually healthy for your brain. Turns out, that thrilling feeling you get when your favorite character does something awesome or pushes through is your brain releasing certain chemicals to match them. And I've never seen a show that so consistently make me wanna stand up and cheer. This might be the most motivational thing you'll ever watch. NOW, GO BEYOND! PLUS ULTRA!",5
my-hero-academia,"Had you ever found your favorite anime was ended because they didn't make enough rating or out of budget? This is the one i'm actually hoping for that not to happen. I'd buy the whole company and the writer to make this to the last episode, non-stop. Soundtrack was very entertaining and really spot on with the main theme. Character developing quite slow, but then when its reach the momentum, it will start rolling fast.",5
my-hero-academia,"Potential SpoilersMinor spoilers from Season 1.Mentions of Season 2 with no context.Gently explained character personalities if that counts as spoiling.The BuildupThis show highlights the benefits of being a strong devout follower of improvement, and incredibly hypes up the audience (it had definitely hyped me up) with Midoriya's efforts. Emphasized by All Might's admiration, the fact that Midoriya was able to perfectly clear the beach alone truly built the character whom wants to move forward despite being told that he cannot. Instead of sitting back in admiration, he chases his dreams to become higher than those he admires because it sets him further in his goal to become a hero. Midoriya as a character motivates the idea of improving by visualizing the power of aspiration as he eliminates his obstacles; he moves forward and trains himself despite being ridiculed by his classmates and Bakugo, who he looked up to, in the first half of Season 1. Furthermore, Midoriya successfully demonstrates his purpose of being a hero: to help others, especially during the entrance exam, and especially during the attack of the villains.The buildup of Midoriya's character in this show is very consistent and while it may be slightly cliche, it doesn't get old, not to mention how Midoriya doesn't have those cringy motivational scenes like many other main characters from other anime who have similar goals.Ratings if I were to be honest:Characters: 10/10Midoriya's character is especially well done, and the same can be said for the secondary characters such as Bakugo, Ochaco, Iida, and Todoroki. As far as the characters with a significant impact to the story, their development is spot-on in my opinion. Even side characters have consistent and lovable personalities.Story: 9/10 The story accompanies the other aspects of the show with a decent storyline. The main character has a goal to achieve that he cannot naturally complete like his peers, but continues to try and gets closer to succeeding. The main character also somehow moves forward despite the drawbacks. I think this is slightly cliche, but original stories tend to be harder to come by with the more shows and stories that come out each year, so the rating doesn't lose more than one point. I think the key to having a good story isn't about originality, but the execution of the story. Midoriya succeeds a lot by chance, again like most other characters, but he acknowledges that and takes it as his own responsibility to improve despite the positive outcomes (Shown in Season 2, you'll know what I mean when I say this). So his advancement isn't just pure nonsense, but it's explained throughout. Also, he doesn't randomly control his powers one time but then fails the other times. For example, he throws with the power of one finger, but still breaks his finger, and his perfect punch was luck, but the circumstances were well explained later.Voice Acting: 10/10I really love how the voices easily match the speaker's personality. Bakugo has an aggressive way of speaking, emphasizing superiority and arrogance, whereas Midoriya speaks lightly with a slight submission, emphasizing caution and awkwardness.Art/Design: 10/10 The art is fairly high quality and consistent, there are rarely any misplaced details or disproportion.In ConclusionAltogether, I know that, even without reading the manga, this anime is definitely going far. Season 2 is already very promising, and I look forward to seeing the rest of this anime through.",5
my-hero-academia,"Ok so I kept saying I wouldn't watch this show because I wasn't crazy about the animation.....but...finally after everyone wouldn't shut up about it, I decided to give it a go. I was hooked by episode one, of course. Just like famous anime protagonists Naruto, Gon, etc., Midoriya is a character that you just can't help but fall in love with. The other characters are developing well too and the fights are awesome. I can't wait to see Midoriya grow as a character. I definitely recommend.",5
my-hero-academia,"I was browsing C.R. for kicks and I saw this one and figured, okay, I'll give it a shot. I had heard zero about the manga and zero about the show, so this was a fresh new world to delve into. Three days in and I finished up season 2 ep 21 and I'm eager for more. Easy binge and easy to get hooked on. Good storytelling and characters that are likeable. There's nothing about this show I don't like. Everything seems to flow well in the episodes and I'm generally interested in the backstories of characters. Well worth the watch.",5
my-hero-academia,"If ""X-men"" and ""Sky High"" had a Japanese love-child, this would be it. With high schools for teens with superpowers called ""quirks"" training to become heroes and fight bad dudes.If you like:- Goofy characters- Fun, typical, cheezy storyline- BADASS fight scenes- A nerdy main character who cries a LOT but fights like a BEAST- and UNITED STATES OF SMASH!Then you'll love this anime. Plus Ultra.",5
my-hero-academia,"Does an anime have to be completely original, to be a masterpiece? Should the story be unpredictable for it to be good?I don't think so.There is beauty in simplicity.The portrayal of every single component of the specific fictional world is the most important point in creating a series.Despite having your typical shounen, (young boy has a dream he wants to achieve so he has to overcome many obstacles on its way despite being an underdog in comparison to many other characters) this series does everything right so far. It does not try to hard with its plot, but still offers a big cast of interesting characters and a story where you can understand and share your feelings with the protagonist.Reaching episode 34, this work woke my feels more than any other series I have seen yet.  The solid art and the emotion generating sounds make a great deal of a this simple, yet for me perfect story.",5
my-hero-academia,"I admit, I was extremely skeptical about this anime. I saw the 5 star reviews, I heard it was recommended by the creator of Naruto but when I saw the art and the first episode, I just didn't get it. I could not have been more wrong.This is...Sky High (old movie some may remember) meets X-Men. Its an incredible story with great characters and although the animation isn't always the best, the fights are really fun to watch unfold. The story is unfolding perfectly and character development is being handled expertly. I can't wait to watch more and I recommend this to anyone. An easy 5 Stars.",5
my-hero-academia,"I got my brother, who doesn't like anime, to get hooked on this! Had him hooked on it since season 1 was released.. That should be enough to make you want to watch it already. This will instantly become one of your favorites if not #1. We are both super excited for Season 4! PLUS ULTRA!Every character in this series is so ""Quirky"" that brings a special individualism to each one :P. The story leaves you in great suspense and theories just keep popping into your head. This was a genius setup as the author can literally do ANYTHING he wants this story. Still the great feel as most of the top shonen, but in a world so unique and an MC that draws out your emotions. This series would turn a lot of non-anime watchers into fans..Enjoy~",5
my-hero-academia,"i went to store and started walking down the pristine aisles, i noticed a small jar with the word ""happiness"" written on the side. I picked up the jar and brought it to the counter, i payed for it and went to the parking lot.In the parking lot i opened the jar and inside was the most beautiful thing i had ever seen, it was Darling In The Franxx. But yeah bnha is very good 10/10 would recommend",5
my-hero-academia,"My Hero Academia.This series has sat in my queue for a couple months before I got around to trying it out.I'm a bit angry at myself for not giving this series a chance for so long. Lately, I've been watching many low quality series leaving me with bitter disappointment in anime in general. To have let this sit in my queue for so long is unforgivable.Simply put, it is amazing. I haven't had these gleeful feelings since first watching Naruto back in the early 2000's. It is a must watch. A required watch.If you're unsure of the series and have let it sit in your queue as well, I highly recommend watching the first four episodes. I guarantee by the end of the fourth, you'll be spurred forward in wanting to see how everything unfolds.Come, Young Midoriya. This is your hero academia!I get goosebumps and a little teary eyed just thinking about that ending. The music was in sync and just perfect.10/10 Go beyond, plus ultra!",5
my-hero-academia,"Through season 3, I can confidently say this is the best shonen I have ever watched. The voice acting is incredible, especially from Deku in the Muscular fight. The animation is also incredible. I love their take on developing their characters and quirks. There was only one pointless/filler episode in 3 seasons so far. A lot of shonen are packed with them. The music scores are also incredible. They will stick in your head. I am looking forward to the future of this series.",5
my-hero-academia,"At first glance, this show seems like just one more addition to a sub-genre flooded with clichés.  DON'T LET IT FOOL YOU.  My Hero Academia takes this sort of story to the next level, consistently surpassing my expectations and getting me more invested in an anime than I've been in years.  Instead of inverting the tropes shonen is known for, this show surrounds and supports them with elegant scaffoldings of motivations and plot points that change the tone of the old, familiar tale from tired to thrilling and remind us that it's the details that make or break a show.  In particular, I'm impressed by the creator's ability to keep all the characters' differing motivations in mind and ensure that they always act in accordance with what's driving them.  This is a very powerful storytelling tool and one that's, sadly, often subsumed into the ""hive mind"" in typical large-cast anime.  This show not only avoids that trap, it somehow keeps the viewer aware of each character's perspective, even in ensemble scenes, which leads to an extremely rich viewing experience.My Hero Academia is by far the best example of its kind that I've seen.  It's ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"" as sung by Whitney Houston.  I'm so, so glad I gave it a chance.",4
my-hero-academia,"Usually I don't like a lot of animes and am found very picky when it comes to the shows I like but HOLLY CRAP THIS ANIME IS GOOD! So far, this anime has pretty solid character backgrounds and designs and even a well crafted plot. Truly, out of all the episodes and seasons so far, my favorite has to be season two and I am expecting get intentions to this anime. I want to refer this anime to Naruto: a simple underdog who fights his way to the top of the charts and this series shows one of the best origin stories I have ever seen/hear. This anime gives me a lot of motivation to fight towards my goal and to overall be happy with the things that you have been blessed within your life!",5
my-hero-academia,"Let me start off with saying that this show is amazing. Boku no Hero Academia, or rather My Hero Academia is the new hot shounen series. This show gets a lot of things right, but it's not perfect either. The first season was rather slow and didn't really introduce us to the characters, but trust me when I say this - the second season totally made up for that problem. The characters were all amazing, and especially one character finally got his time to shine. Our main character Izuku or Deku (whatever you wanna call him) still amazes me, he is not the typical ""whiny"" character, and I can't wait to see him develop even more. The animation was done by well known studio Bones, also known for other popular shows like Fullmetal Alchemist and Noragami. The animation was good, but it was kinda expected I guess? For the music we currenly have 3 openings, and all 3 are amazing (even though my favorite is the second one, Peace  Sign) but I never felt like there was any piece in the soundtrack that stood out to me, maybe my taste in music is just bad?I have conflicted feelings on this show, because I feel like it is too ""over hyped"", I see why it's great, but I wouldn't go out of my way to say this is like a gift from god. I did enjoy this show a lot and I do recommend it. If you like action then what are you waiting for? Therefore, I rate Boku no Hero Academia a solid 7,88 out of 10 and recommend you to watch the heck out of this show. (Please accept that this is my opinion, so don't feel offended in any way, thank you for understanding.)",5
my-hero-academia,"My Hero Academia has delved into some dangerous territory:Multi-episode fightsTournament arcsMain characters that are introduced very lateAnd NEVER ONCE was is boring or cliche.When I found out that season two of this show would heavily focus on a singular tournament I was ready to begin crawling out of my skin as I watched episode after episode of the same two days or so and god did this show come in clutch. The tournament arc was amazing and fun and I was actually sad when it ended. The fight scenes are long, but never dull which makes them a pleasure to watch. The characters all have interesting and captivating backstories and motivations.Nothing in this show has disappointed me and, from the way things are going, I don't think anything will.",5
my-hero-academia,"I've been told by my sister and a friend about this show, and to be honest, I can't remember the last time I was so thrilled and engaged into a fictional world that I would watch it (almost) non-stop, and then pick up the manga and get up to date with the events. It could have been when I read The Count of Monte Cristo, or the Sherlock Holmes stories for the first time; all I gotta say is that My Hero Academia is one of the best shows I have ever seen. The characters are well built, the story is immersive and the soundtrack is bonkers.",5
my-hero-academia,"I'll keep this short and simple. Going into this, I thought, ""How could it be better than One Punch Man?"" Well its not better than One Punch...BUT! It's an amazing piece of work. Its Pacing is near perfect to me, Allowing you to watch the steady growth of character development. Instead of watching a hero be a hero, You get to watch the start of a legend. The characters are all very well designed as well. They feel pretty fresh compared to a lot of other anime characters. Don't get me started on the art style. Its all too good, and I feel any shonen lover will quickly find what they love about shonen here.",5
my-hero-academia,"thought it was going to be another good start, bad end series like SAO, but man was I surprised. The character development is great and realistic, tackling things like peer pressure, Eugenics, and rivalries all within a school setting without the school being the only setting. The arcs are great, each with its own plot, setting, buildup and finale, while at the same time setting up the next arc nicely without leaving out key elements of the current plot, as other anime tend to do with bad cliffhangers.The heroes themselves are great, varied, have unique powers, and explained backstories, along with the villains. Nothing is too cheesy or hammed up, sort of like the villains from One Punch Man in that though they all look silly, everyone of them is a murderer.The best way i can describe My Hero Academia for the new viewer is that it reminded me a lot of the first season of Naruto, in which the main character can't control his power, his main rivals are hotheaded and powerful, and they are rather quickly thrown into a situation with much more powerful enemies than they can handle. The flow of the story is much better, though, and the exposition is toned down more.Watch up to the episode of the Entrance Exam, and you will know if you will like it or not, as the series fights only get more intense after that. I guarantee you that you will not be disappointed after watching this through, Such a emotional rollercoaster.",5
my-hero-academia,"My Hero Academia is an amazing show filled with action and adventure and a some touches of sadness here and there. You'll fall in love with every character (except Mineta). It's a classic villain VS super hero anime. And it's quite a wholesome and very well done. It is also inspiring to people who think they are nothing and want to be great. It shows that anyone can be a hero even if they don't have any special gifts. It has a great message that will encourage people to keep going.Go Beyond, PLUS ULTRA! Shoto Todoroki is my favourite because we both kinda have the same past. (Except being burned though.)",5
my-hero-academia,"I'm fairly new to anime but despite that, My Hero Academia is one of the best stories I've ever indulged in. I was roped in with an interesting world that I wanted to learn more about. As I was watching the show I grew to love and appreciate this masterpiece, and it gave me an escape from the rough times I was going through. Right now I'm anticipatedly waiting for the next episodes to come out so that I cheer my favorite heroes on through their thrilling journey.",5
my-hero-academia,"I have watched 3 whole animes in my life: Attack on Titan, One-Punch man, and My Hero Academia. I think I'm being polite when I say My Hero Academia blew both of the other two out of the water completely. It has such a good plot, and the animation in this series is great! I'm very ready for season 4 to be completely release so I can go on another binge-spree. I highly recommend this show, it's flat out amazing.",5
my-hero-academia,"Anime's take on super heroes, who of course from some reason are all going to school.The main character, tone, and overall story are great. It hits all the shonen stereotypes pretty hard, but does them well. It also does a good job of building an ensemble of interesting supporting characters. Last but not least, there are some superbly animated scenes and powerful moments that really pull out all the stops.The only real con that comes to mind, is the hero's main rival and childhood buddy/bully. Not sure where the creators come up with these type of characters, he's frankly just ridiculous, doesn't really add much to the show, and wastes a fair amount of screen time now and then. Just feels like a creative miss.",5
my-hero-academia,"I was very hesitant to start this series at first because I was told that it plays out like Naruto, which I'm not really into.However, this was not really the case.I love this series so much, the character design, their personalities and powers are all very interesting and new ones are being introduced at a great rate.The pacing for the series is great, I am always excited to see what's going to happen next. Many of the battles and problems that arise in the series will draw you in and make you anxious to see how they unfold.the only thing they need to change is Mineta, who is possibly the absolute most horrible and unlikable character ever created in the history of anime.",5
my-hero-academia,"This was one of the first anime shows I looked at, and most of the shows I watched before were not as mind-grabbing or world changing as My Hero Academia. This show's use of music and the animation was on point. Out of the anime I have watched, not many had a great OP, story, animation, ED, characters, powers, emotional moments, and villains/antagoinst. This show has it all. If you are not a huge anime person, you will like it. If you are an anime god, then you will love it. If you have heard any bad things from anyone, look at the first 2 or 3 episodes and then judge. My Hero Academia is worth it, and I can't wait for season four. Let's Go.",5
my-hero-academia,"In just a few seasons MHA has shown that its a force to be reckoned with. The writing is flawless, the character development is believable and relatable even. The action speaks for itself -  you just know the animators pour their souls into each scene. Bones Studios is delivering what anime fans have been wanting for years. This will leave the same impression on this generation like ""Naruto"" did for mine when it first came out. Absolutely looking forward to the future of MHA. If things continue to be this good this will probably break into most viewers top 5 anime lists easily.",5
my-hero-academia,"MemerableEven a year after watching the first 3 seasons I can still recall names and specific arcs. Though in my opinion, the Training Camp arc is the best. Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideJust like the USJ attacks and All Might defeating Nomu. This might not be a spoiler now but just staying safe.RewatchingI had finished the third season back in 2018, and now I'm back to watch it again in anticipation for season 4.First anime review don't judge.",5
my-hero-academia,"Someone else made a review here about My Hero Academia being good for you brain. I just want confirm that it really is.I was recommended this series by a friend, who mentioned that the music was awesome (it is), but I didn't really get around to watch it until I got really mentally broken down.Watching My hero academia during this time was the best decision I've ever made. No other series have successfully conveyed that kind of ideas to me before that this series do. It sounds cheesy, but the resolution of the second season may actually have saved my life. Or at least changed it for the better.I cannot state that enough. This show conveys message after message that I think everyone will need to hear at some point in their life, and the show does all that without feeling like it is force-feeding you.Also, it is darn masterpiece even without all that. The music is great, the VA is on-point, it is action packed and inspiring. Each episode leaved you longing for the next without it every feeling cheap. It breaks clichés over and over again. No matter if you feel good or bad right now, just watch it. It's simply plus ultra.",5
my-hero-academia,"Battle shonen, for how much I don't care for it, it's been there for many of the steps of my anime journey.Dragonball Z was an early anime for me back in the Toonami days, but I always had a strange resistance to the genre mainstays that would come after. However, on a bored day, trying out the manga, I decided I might give this a go. Why? Well, I'm a long time reader of American super hero comics. Seeing someone work to fuze the tropes of both American super heroes and Japanese battle shonen piqued my interest. As much as I was done with one's tropes, seeing a reinterpretation sounded interesting. Is it original then? No. Why would anyone expect something built on the tropes of two genres to be original? I see people complain about that. That's just silly. But it doesn't have to be original to be entertaining. And entertaining it is.You want original? Well, that ship sailed on story telling generations ago. If you think otherwise, you're just fooling yourself.",4
my-hero-academia,"An amazing series that pokes fun and subverts superhero tropes in the best way possible. The fights between villains and heroes can honestly go either way, and we are allowed to see heroes be vulnerable.There's a tournament arc that's not annoying filler and is exciting to watch. Minimum fan service, amazing OST, and an entertaining story. I honestly love (and sympathize) with all the character villains and All Might included. I know, I feel for the supposedly God-like character. Only an excellent series could make me do that. I can't wait to see Deku reach his full potential (and throw them hands at Bakugo). Anyway, a 10/10 series through each season (movie also). I can't wait to see how this series ends.",5
my-hero-academia,"IF anyone says that this anime is bad or good for a younger audience. Then you should know in a way they are correct. You see, towards the beginning of the show the animation and perspectives on the different problems is a less mature one. However, these people did also not give the show a chance and are missing out on a lot because of this. The show actually becomes mature and shows the creators excellent worldbuilding and character development skills. The show is very mature and deals with quite heavy themes that many adults have still not managed to figure out themselves. If you give this show even three episodes, you can begin to see the direction it is going in, and how the characters might mature. And, if any of the characters begin to seem redundant or cliche, then you will be proven wrong, in the way they develop. And if even then they still seem cliche, then you should at least realize how much more 3d they are than a lot of other shounin characters. Honestly, to the people who gave this a lower total grade have not given the show its time to show just how great the world and characters are. While this anime may not be one that goes on many peoples favorite lists, it is still greatly deserving of 5 stars. Each fight, character, plot point, arc, animation, art, music, and any other thing that you could think of that is important to an anime, is done with near perfection in this show. You cannot give this series enough praise. Please know that if the characters ever seem cliche, naive, or immature, give it time, and you will see just how good the show is, and how important the first episodes where to setting up the main character. If you still think this way, than you are probably are an edge lord who watches shows like ""akame ga kill"" because the deaths make it ""mature"".",5
my-hero-academia,"Going in, I was skeptical with the name and presentation, but the story line, artwork, character development, and progression is way beyond what I have seen recently.  This is 100% a show that will have you on the edge of your seat in some scenes and pulling tears from your eyes in others.    My Hero definitely does not pull its punches when it comes to the action sequences but the dialog is not lacking and equals out over the entire show.  This one is definitely on my rewatch list when the next season comes out.     Give this a watch.  You will not be disappointed.",4
my-hero-academia,"Quality battles with unmatched character development. Solid world building that leaves you wanting to learn more about hero society as it is displayed in this universe. Unlimited possibilities for quirks keep the battles refreshing and the dynamic between our main character, Deku, and his rival throughout the series, Bakugou, always leave you wanting to see how their relationship will progress. Looking forward to more episodes being released.",5
my-hero-academia,"Honestly this is an anime I've actually been keeping up with and It's something new to the Shonen genre. Best Shonen of all Time? Debatable. Best Shonen of the New Gen? Definitely! Nothing compares to My Hero Academia. Boruto, Seven Deadly Sins, and Black Clover all fail in comparison to My Hero Academia. My Hero Academia brings a new plot twist to the genre and Brings new character plots as well. Instead of using Aliens, Supernatural Beings, and Ninjas, My Hero Academia uses actual Superheroes like the concept came straight out of a comic book. Some people will say My Hero Academia is over rated, but This anime is at the top for a reason. Nothing is beating it at the moment and I doubt anything will for awhile. I give My Hero Academia a 5 out of 5 *'s",5
my-hero-academia,"Amazing Build-up This Show is one of my Favorites, it takes some  time to build up but is so worth it. If your looking for a storyline that builds the Characters and gives you a just the right amount of backgroud, but not overwhelming then this is the right show for you. It has the Drama, the Love the Action, the ????‍???? mistery that we all love in our Stories. If you want to know more about new shows and the ones that you must check out, Head over to my Page Blackstorm We would love to Darken your Taste. HAHAHA Blackstorm",5
my-hero-academia,"The main reason why I love the show is because it is an underdog type story, even if it's a shonen cliche I feel that it adds things to make it different from another like Naruto.The art style for me is amazing, unique just like all the characters the show offers. Each character has their moment to shine even though it is not as crucial compared to the main character it's what make the show more enjoyable. Fight scenes are pretty good especially season 2 (No spoilers) but compared to some other anime it isn't mindblowing (Choreography mainly). First season kicks the action off so it might not impress you so much, but if you continue to watch it until season 2 it will probably leave a mark, and you might even decide to watch until the anime finishes who knows?It's a good anime I would recommend it but that is your choice obviously.",5
my-hero-academia,I put off watching this anime FOR SO LONG for such a stupid reason.  On the cover art I was always seeing I saw Todoroki's face and I thought he was a dog person with a spot over his eye so I kept avoiding this anime.  For real.After FINALLY giving it a chance I found that was not the case at all and I am thoroughly and seriously impressed.  This show can bring tears to my eyes in almost every episode.  Not because it's sad or anything but the comradery makes me choke up.10/10 recommend to anyone who wishes they had superpowers.,5
my-hero-academia,"There are a lot of reviews here already that tell you why the show is good, which I completely agree with, so this review will be touching on some of the hater's reasons for hating on this show. Warning: Possibly some Minor Spoilers:Reason 1: The premise is typical - While a bizarre and unique plot can be awesome and really catch someone's attention, at the end of the day it's all about the execution. So many shows sound so great, but end up failing because the only thing good about it is basically just the premise. On the other hand MHA's premise might not be the most out of the box, however the execution is fantastic on just about every level: Deep characters, hits hard with emotions, big twists, great flow, amazing voice acting, animation, and music.Reason 2: MC is too whiney - People who say this don't seem to understand the MC's character at anything more than a surface level. First off he is not whiney, he is simply full of fear for good reasons. Our MC is powerless in a world full of superpowers as well as being short and scrawny, therefore he would be completely powerless against virtually any villain. Our MC isn't some downright oblivious head first MC like in so many other shounen's. He is incredibly smart and realistic and therefore fully understands his inabilities and the consequences of his actions, unlike any Shounen MC i've ever seen. If you were in his shoes can you walk about with fearlessness and confidence? If your smart like him, definitely not.I mentioned that he is incredibly smart and realistic, yet his goal is to be a great hero when he has no abilities. Sounds contradictory I know, but here's the thing: Our MC understands how foolish his dreams are, and he is too smart to believe himself either in the beginning. He is not chasing his dream because he really believes he can do it, but because for him there is no other path he is willing to follow. If there is even a 0.001% chance then he is willing to bet it all on his dream. That is why our MC chases his dream despite understanding better than anyone else how impossible it is. As the show goes on you might see that his fear and understanding of his inabilities actually elevates his character beyond any other shounen MC I have ever seen. He is full of fear and fully understands all the costs and risks, however for his ideals he is willing to face any fears and pay any cost. Incredibly inspiring to say the least.Reason 3: Characters are uninteresting Yes there are some characters that are not fleshed out, typical, and blah blah blah, but you can't be fleshing out every single character when there are hundreds of characters. The pacing and flow of the story would be ridiculous if that were the case. Most of the main ones are very deep and some of the villains are incredible as well. When a show is said to have great characters, it's not accounting for a bunch of side characters, but mostly the main ones and a few of the supporting cast.",5
my-hero-academia,"One look at the image of this anime and I was like pass. I don't watch this genre. It is just not targeted towards me! But I heard this was a good underdog story. Im a sucker for them so I decided to give it a try...Oh my... I don't know when but I am a total fan now. This is funny, emotional, has great character development this has everything you want in a great show. This will be in my top all time favorites.Now trying to stop fangirling around, I thought this would be full of boring filler all around but I was surprised. None so far, besides recaps but they are recaps at the start of a season when you need one.The art style took me a while to get use but its not bad, again not my genre! The story has a good pace and nothing seems to be rushed. The one thing I hate is that I binge watch the first two seasons and now I have to wait for new episodes. I would recommend this to everyone. This show is not over hyped. Im proof of it. It's overall one of the great ones all you need to do is give it a chance and it will steal your heart.",5
my-hero-academia,"Easily one of the best shounen airing.  Hands down.  Full Stop.I'd describe the seemingly cookie-cutter setup and over-played premise, but frankly that doesn't do the show justice.  The show is equal parts exciting, endearing, and immersive.  I don't think there's any aspect to the show or plot point (so far) that hasn't been done somewhere else beforehand, but I don't think it's ever been done quite so well or with so much passion.Everything from the art to voice acting, to writing, to story is just superbly knit together.",5
my-hero-academia,"If you enjoyed Shonen like Naruto, One Piece, Fairy Tale, Tiger and Bunny or The Seven Deadly Sins then your in the right place. In a world where abilities called quirks are everything our main character Izuku Midoriya wants to be a hero but has none, until luck finds him. The voice acting is spot on for each hero and villain. The heightened emotion will pull you in. Studio Bones makes use of cliffhangers and rarely uses filler episodes. This is an action packed anime you shouldn't miss.",5
my-hero-academia,"I'll list a few reasons why this show is in my opinion the greatest shounen out there:-The universe is amazing. I haven't seen anything TOO cliche, although thats kinda hard to avoid in an anime,  but it holds itself up well and the lore can get pretty deep.-The characters are great, each character has his own amazing personality, and you can clearly see the character development throughout the seasons-The artstyle is simply great, it displays clearly the emotions of each character and I love it.-The animation is extremely fluid, amazing quality.-The colors are bright and vivid, and gives great life to the show.-The villains, oh the villains. They're a big reason why I love the series: They are genuinely scary. Tomura Shigaraki legit gave me chills the first time I saw him.These are a few reasons why this is my favorite shounen and maybe the best. My opinion though, you might have a different one.-zuzur_",5
my-hero-academia,"What makes this anime so good is is that every aspect of this anime is extremely polished and refined. It's as if the Shounen genre was carefully nurtured by passing through the hands of many creators (just like One For All) and the result was My Hero Academia. However, this is precisely where the anime is lacking. Although refined, there doesn't seem to be much that makes this anime particularly special; there isn't some aspect of it that really pushes the limits of anime. However, it's undeniably interesting to watch and I look forward to the new episodes!",5
my-hero-academia,"best anime ive seen in  a while. binge watched from season 1 and sad i now have to wait for saturdays.awesome show. highly recommended to everyone to watch.great story and keeps you hooked.however i do wish the intro and outros weren't so long.(1:30 each) thats one element i dislike about animes, they always have way to long intro/outros. Make the episode seem short and in some cases it does make it short.",5
my-hero-academia,"TL:DR Watch this for the story even if you do not like the genre.  The tale is a wonderful blend of action and the coming of age for a group of students.Toradora, was the first five star anime that I wrote a review for on Crunchyroll.  The weaving of the narrative, the risks it took, along with the gut punching emotions and the willingness to allow other secondary characters to shine became the standard bearer that I compare other romance-slice of life-comedies to.My Hero Academia is going to do the same in different ways in this genre of Anime.The tale sound simplistic enough:  Its about the journey of a young man to become the best hero of his time.  In that journey he has trials, friends, rivals and enemies that he picks up along the way.But, after watching it, I realized that its the examination of the journey and not the end point. It goes into the mechanics of the how's and why's not just of the main characters, but the secondary and one off characters.  The world feels exactly how it is supposed to and not just limited by the school settings.  Watching the main character and secondary characters interact with one another and the world at large with their own individual and relatively complex backstories makes them realistic and it immerses the watcher into the story itself, never attempting to wink at the camera or go over the top.Everything happens for a reason, and keep a careful eye as you watch for the first time the subtle parts of the story.  There is an ebb and flow to the story arcs and with a few missteps (which will be in the spoiler section) work seamlessly and builds from one to another while giving the audience a chance to breath in the process.Every character in the main character's class is memorable, I may not remember  their names but if you showed me a picture I can tell you three scenes that they heavily contributed to the plot of an episode or the series as a whole (that's 20 characters).  The students all have goals and lives outside of the classroom, that are for the most part explained.  Each one is unique in their own right from the way they talk to the way they walk and have a story to tell.  While the main focus is on the protagonist every relationship happens organically and with a reason.The Teachers are adults!  This left me thunderstruck once I realized it.  They have their own quirky and sometimes goofy personalities, but they have the best interests in the instruction and the *safety* of the students.  There are rules and laws that the students must abide by to be safe and have real consequences; and everyone of them are practical and necessary for the society that they live.Actions in this story have consequences, and not all of them are pleasant.   There are heartwarming triumph and heartbreaking failures; and both sometimes happen at the same time. There is the complexity of unnecessary guilt, fatal flaws and choices that should have been better thought through (by students and adults alike), and none of this gets hand-waved away.  Instances that have no right answers occur and they have lasting effects forces characters to change physically and mentally.The art is detailed mixing western style and Japanese animation together and it is quality work that helps to immerse you into the world.  People walk differently from one another in the background and everything looks alive, with a few exceptions panning from scene to scene.The music especially the third op is very symbolic of the journey itself and I only found the third ending song to be found wanting and that was more of the setting of the symbolism.All in all a very satisfying and enjoyable show. (spoilers below this)Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hide  There was one thing that these guys did that almost knocked this down to a 4 star instead of a 5 star that is shown:  The last episode of the second season as a whole and the first three minutes of the first half of the second season.The last episode should have been the start of the third season.  It had no business being the last episode, as this felt like it was a cheap ploy for a third season.  The first of the second season wasted three minutes of time that could have developed the interpersonal relationships instead of being an overview of the last five minutes of the previous episode.  Heck this would have been better spent on Deku and his mother and the nervous breakdown she's about to have in the third season (which is part of the reason that I hated the ending of episode 38 is that is the only thing that is not really built up well).  Again that is my only main gripe against this story.Since there is a point of Deku overall succeeding that actually helped me relax and enjoy the story as it is, because as it is explained in its subtle way this is the study of the journey and not really the destination.Which brings me the Deku.  What a relief, to have a can-do attitude, have successes and setbacks that only make him more determined.  Compared to most angst silly main characters or big shots that need to be taken down, Deku is working through the struggle the best he can not having to learn the lesson of relying on others for support.  Even the shy romance that is budding doesn't stop him from asking Ochaco help or talking to her like an equal.Even in spoilers I won't go too much into it because quite frankly you owe it to yourself to watch the series.  You will not regret it.",5
black-clover,"Before I watch any anime and invest my time in them.. I read the reviews.. and for Black Clover I saw all the negativity on here about Asta's voice (the main character) ... I immediately judged the anime and didn't even give it a chance when I heard his voice. I literally couldn't watch more than 5 minutes of the show.. After a few months later and me not having anymore good anime to watch.. I decided to give it another chance. I braced myself for the yelling... but as the story went on. I fell in love and Asta is one of my favorite characters in the anime. I highly suggest anyone that loves One Piece, Fairy Tail, or Naruto to watch this anime.",4
black-clover,"As someone who has read the manga, I will say this series does grow on you. It may have a generic start but I think it is fine to be inspired by your peers as Tabata-sensei (author) clearly has. That being said it does grow its own unique narrative as it progresses and has some very interesting characters as well. I believe execution is more important than originality in art forms these days. Just because a show is original, it doesn't mean its going to be good but a well executed show will always be good. Studio Pierriot has a challenge ahead of them but this series actually does have potential for greatness. Let's see where this goes.",5
black-clover,"I'm being lenient giving it a 4 when it probably deserves a 3 at this current moment, it's (FINALLY) trending in the right direction though, hence the 4 stars. I reserve the right to change my dang mind though if it drops the ball it took too long to pick up to begin with. Really the title explains it all though.The first three episodes are so slowly and badly paced that can be downright unwatchable. Episode 3 is nothing but filler that offers nothing to the story, which is nonsense the manga is 133 episodes in so really you can skip episode 3 entirely. Episode 4 is when things finally start to happen but by this point many can be really tired and give up and though Episode's 4 is better, its not so much better that it'll just grab your attention. Episode 5 might get your attention if you've found a way to slug yourself through this far. Episode's 6 and 7 were both really entertaining and the added bits actually add some extra context to this show that aren't in the manga.A lot of these problems are caused by old solutions to manga that are paced quickly. I never read Black Clover so when it came out as an anime and it started I was interested because I heard good things, but wasn't convinced to read the manga so decided to give the anime a try. After two episodes of 'dear god this is not good at all' I read the manga to see why people liked the manga so much and enjoyed it so much I binged what I think was 120ish chapters in 2 days. The manga is extremely fast paced and doesn't dwell on much, which lets it be a really fun read. It also makes it really hard to fill up a 24 minute episode every week when you could anime an entire chapter in for 10 minutes of time and the first few chapters don't have a lot of transition to one another. If you really want to give this a shot after hearing the mixed reviews here's my recommendation. Watch episode 1, Skim episode 2 (it's not as bad as 1 but gets old quick), skip episode 3 entirely it's just awful and you'll miss nothing, and watch 4 through 7. That would be my recommendation as of this moment.What happens in episode 3 you ask for those who read all this? The tow brothers leave town to join the 'magic knights' that are the central point of this show, rehashing some vastly overused and not that funny jokes, and do a bad montage of the two brothers traveling to the capital city. Episode ends. If you REALLY want to watch episode 3 watch until they leave, cringe a bit, and once they leave stop watching.Also, yes Asta's voice is unbearable but somehow it got way less obnoxious come episode 5 or 6, I forget which.",4
black-clover,This anime shows promise and i cant wait to see what kinds of powers Asta has to offer. He might be screaming for a huge percent of the episode but taking his age and some of his background history into consideration and you might understand. This anime needs time to unravel so lets not bash it just yet. I'm giving it a 5 out of 5 because i can see the greatness this could turn out to be.,4
black-clover,"Let's get the negative out of the way first. This show feels about a decade too late. Everything in the show has already been done before, and better. It tries to be like the oldschool shonen we grew up with, like Naruto and One Piece, to the point that many aspects of the show feel straight up stolen, namely the MC constantly saying he's going to become the Wizard King despite everyone else's disapproval, being a direct imitation of Luffy and his gosal to become the Pirate King. The MC himself is the generic, never-give-up, shonen protagonist, but with a twist: He never-stops-SCREAMING. EVER. You do get used to it after a while, but you can also get used to giving yourself paper cuts on the webs between your fingers. That doesn't mean it sucks any less. The animation is usually around average, but can dip HARD at times. I'm not usually one to even notice animation dips, but I found myself pointing them out very often with this show.Now I say all of this-but the show does have its merits. The rival dynamic between the MC and his childhood friend, Yuno, is actually very well done. Probably one of my favorites. And the lack of filler is GREAT. Even on some episodes that feel like filler are never without some purpose. One in particular I started almost certain it was going to be an uneventful filler episode, ended with a new girl being added to the MCs harem. Speaking of which the harem formation in this show is also fantastic. Every girl that becomes infatuated with the MC has believable reasons that make you feel like it isn't forced just for the sake of having a harem.The biggest grey spot for this show is, like I stated earlier, it feels a decade late.It's almost nothing but done-to-death tropes, but that is also a part of it's charm. It really feels like an old school anime that someone just unearthed one day and we're all just discovering it for the first time together. It really brings me back to the good old days of shonen anime when I was younger. All in all.... Eeeh. It's 'aight.",5
black-clover,"First off I don't read manga, but I have been avidly watching anime since 2009 when I got Internet for the first time so even non manga readers can enjoy this anime. haha(referencing a previous post saying you won't enjoy this anime if you're not a die hard fan)So far episode two and I'm somewhat entertained EXCEPT for the MC's incredibly annoying voice and screams. Let's hope this anime lives up to its potential. But seriously... I could understand if people pass on this anime solely because of the main character's screams. Lol",3
black-clover,"For those that are deterred from all the bad reviews, this show started out quite slow, and with not much going on. I continued to watch it and gave it a chance, now it has gotten much better with a whole lot more going on. The only downside is that episodes feel very short due to the same intro playing over and over taking up time. However, I'm REALLY enjoying it now and can't wait for more episodes to come out!",4
black-clover,"Exposition is ridiculous:* Asta repeats I'm going to be the wizard king once every thirty seconds.* We are told Asta cant use magic. We are shown Asta cant use magic. It is repeated every few minutes: ""just a reminder in case you forgot: Asta, you can't use magic""Instead of saying anything just once, it is repeated until you can't enjoy any dialogue. because the entire dialogue is repeated over and over and over. Everything is repeated over and over in this show. any of the top 5 plot events per episode is repeated 10x. Because none of us are smart enough to hear something once and remember it. Let alone any kind of great story telling that gets its points across without explicitly telling you things.The bloody screaming. Please. If it weren't enough that you shout"" I'ma gunna be the wizard king"" at noone in particular, his ONE OTHER LINE OF DIALOGUE is screaming. At nothing. All the time.",5
black-clover,black clover keeps getting better and better and better episode by episode. the current water temple arc is really good i love how each black bull is getting their time to shine. i can't wait to see what finral and vanessa have to show. i also love the main villian of this arc vetto there is much more to the eye of the midnight sun that needs to be shown. theyre shaping up to be a great villian threat,4
black-clover,"I like this show and I keep watching but each episode has so many obnoxious flaws.  I find myself wanting to see how the story progresses but the execution week to week is frustrating.Many of the problems have been mentioned continually.  It's derivative, full of cliches, the main character is loud/annoying, lots of stalling and filler tactics.  Those are generally true but they don't bother me as much what they have done with the supporting characters.  Most of the side characters are reduced to flat, canned one liners.  It feels like they didn't have dialogue in the script and someone improvised lines when they popped on the screen for the first time.  Then every time that character reappears they just say the same thing over and over with no development.  To make it worse they will often flash through several of these characters, multiple times per episode to burn screen time.I probably would rate this series 3 out of 5 but every episode makes me feel like I'm being poked in the ribs with a sharp stick to find out what happens next.",5
black-clover,"Overall this is a solid story that is presented with decent animation and poor voice acting (mostly from Asta, good freaking lord that screaming).The anime sticks to the manga pretty closely from my point of view, so I don't feel it's right to judge this series off of plot, that is not a problem here thankfully. I see the responsibility of anime, in this instance where it has manga as it's inspiration, is to take the original work and bring to life the source material in a way that only anime can, adding to the experience for both the seasoned manga fans as well as newcomers to the series. At the very least if you have never heard of this series before then the anime version of Black Clover needs to give you the same appreciation for the series that the manga version of Black Clover gives, and I really can't say this series does that. Overall, I have read the manga up to it's current chapter and have enjoyed the progression of Asta and the rest of the Black Bulls up to this point and I can say with full sincerity that there is nothing in the anime that makes me want to watch it every week that I can't get from going back and rereading the manga.This is worth watching if something better hasn't released first, definitely not a must-see-at-all-costs anime, not by a long shot.Side note: I'm so glad I'm not the only one that hates Asta's screaming, It severely annoyed me to the point of not wanting to watch past episode 2 almost.",4
black-clover,"...AAAAAAAA - introduction Asta style. This was supposed to be a new ""king of shonen"". Although I admit the story is not the worst thing I have seen, Black Clover is far beyond other classics of the genre. Its characters are mostly unenjoyable, annoying and not symphatic at all. It depends way too much on elements of other well known series. For example take a look at  Asta, the main hero, who seems to be some kind of mixture of Rock Lee (ass hard training), Nastu (carefree nature) and Ichigo (wanna protect everyone+that sword).. I have nothing against these things, but people who know other series will immediately see them in Asta so he loses his own unique personality. The only new thing is maybe the screaming, which I am not really a fan of...Two stars, one for the try, the other for the Marylin Manson cameo.",4
black-clover,"I am a bit let down by the studio when it comes to Black Clover. After watching 13 episodes, I see some good and some bad with the series as a whole.I do not think dismissing the show souly on Asta being annoying is enough to rate the series poorly. Don't get me wrong, the voice acting and the writers choice of dialog for him is absolutely, undeniably headache provoking. However, if you can look past the annoying character, they have developed an interesting world.The hierarchy system is an interesting comment on society where it takes certain stereotypes and blatantly rubs it in your face. I also enjoy the different ""factions"" within the Magic Knights. Each faction has their own set of personality traits and ideals in which they represent. I find this extremely telling to the character development for each character.The cinematography and animation is not bad, but not great. I would not put it on the list for best animation but I can appreciate their attempts. I do however, enjoy the individuality and design of each character's magic. I find this is where they put a lot of their design efforts into and fell short on the environment surrounding.I strongly believe that the fact that they tried to sell this as ""the next Naruto"" did not do them any favours, people had high expectations because of that and they certainly fell short. I do not believe the series to be terrible, but I am certainly not praising it's name. I will not scream for tatos..",4
black-clover,"I feel torn. I want to watch more but I can not with Asta, the MC, screaming most of the time. The first episode seemed interesting, even if generic, but that is perhaps due to the high quality of the animation. What I might try is turning down the volume. Or, I just may check out the manga instead.It is my hope that if this should ever see an English dub release that the English VA for the MC does not do the same thing.",3
black-clover,"This is going to take three episodes before I can tell whether or not this show will actually be as interesting as it was advertised. As a heads up, this is a review coming from someone who knows very little about this series, all I know is that it was hyped up right before it started airing. So this review shouldn't be biased.I already have some gripes about the show.1. The main character's VA is really annoying. He is constantly screaming and it makes my throat hurt just hearing it. It astounds me that he will keep talking like that for possibly 12+ episodes.2. The story so far is somewhat generic and cliche, though the way it's going is not too cliche for my tastes.3. If you look at it from afar it's very hilariously starting to mirror Naruto.I think it goes without saying that there are some good points already, but I want to wait and see before I go too in depth. It was very funny at times so I'll give it a watch every week!Now that we have gotten to episode 4, I gotta say that I need to see even MORE episodes before I can even call this worthwhile. It kinda bugs me because it's starting to set itself up for a long running show like One Piece or Naruto. If it does, I think this will just be like Fairy Tail with me, where the only reason I watch it is because I had the time to watch it every week. Hopefully, if it doesn't have long seasons like Fairy Tail, etc. then it will pace itself accordingly.I mean, right at the end of ep 4 it did make me want to see the next episode, but I don't really know if it will be as good as I think it is.",5
black-clover,"The story and art of Black Clover led me to find manga translations to read, so I like the story.  However, since it's inception in anime, it feels like the animation has slowly degraded.  It was great, and then at some point it's like they switched animation companies or something and the quality of the character animations took a hit.  Very noticeable difference, but still tolerable.However this last episode (12/18) seems to have taken a -drastic- turn for the worse.  The battle sequences were so poor, it was hard to tell what was going on.  And at some points my friend and I were watching and we started joking that it seemed like maybe they ran out of money and stopped coloring things.The story, in my opinion is still strong enough to keep me going, but if the animation quality doesn't recover, I'm likely to drop the anime completely and just stick with the manga.",2
black-clover,"Characters: 3/5Story: 4/5Animation: 2/5Flow: 1/5Overall: 2.5/5The start of this series was super fun and interesting but as the show went on it was easy to tell that the writers/animators were having reduced budget. This show drags on so much that it isn't even funny. The first three episodes just cover chapter 1 of the manga and they keep that up all the way through. The animation budget also varies greatly from episode to episode, one episode can have epic action and animation but then the next one will look like a turd in comparison. Asta the main character is blander than old bread served with water. The only saving grace to this show is the side characters and their interactions.",3
black-clover,Give it a shot. The first few episodes are bad. because Asta yells about wanting to be the next hokage constantly. the first few chapters of the manga didn't have him using non-caps till like chapter 5.  The first part of that manga and htis anime Might be hard to get past.  I don't know why naruto is constantly yelling about being the next wizard king.Get pass that here is what it does good. and the  reasons to watch1. fights are amazing.  magic fights and then sword fights.2. gordon3. yami4. good humor5. while magic exist not anybody has been shows to have the same type,5
black-clover,I usually give around 5 episodes to give a show a chance whether it grabs my attention or not. The story seems interesting and it seems like the characters and plot can become very good but the overall pace of the story is extremely boring. It does not draw any interest and after a few episodes I find myself not really looking forward to the next episode. I also understand that Asta is the outgoing and loud character in typical animes and there are many character similar to him but his voice acting just gives me a headache. Its not very convicting and is plain annoying. Got to episode 11 and could not make myself continue.,5
black-clover,"The show has a pretty interesting concept. It’s far from original, but it’s still somewhat enjoyable. But... each episode doesn’t actually begin until about 5 minutes in. It kills the pacing. From there you often have flashbacks to previous episodes and then the little animations at the end of each episode. You’re probably only watching 10 minutes of new story and even that is dragged. It’s a good show to binge if you got nothing else to watch. I hear the manga is much better though.",2
black-clover,"It's the classic story of an orphan ""starting from the bottom now we're here"" type story. To be 100% honest nothing about this is special other than Asta's cool sword(s), and his hilarious yell. The characters are fun, the story is fun, and overall it's not a bad watch if you don't mind predictability. This series isn't going to win any awards that's for sure, but I really don't care. I've enjoyed watching every single episode and can't wait for the next one. The more you watch the more you want even though it's nothing special. I think we can all relate to Asta's struggle in one way or another throughout our lives and appreciate this for what it is; simple, clean, fun, and that's what matters to me.",5
black-clover,"For reference: I watch subs and have watched through episode 22 as of Mar. 8, 2018. I do plan to continue following the series for the rest of the season. tl,dr; provided at bottom. Rating: 3 Stars.UPDATED: Dec. 30, 2018. See note below tl;dr for explanation. Updated rating: 2 stars.--Decent artwork and music, no complaints there. Okay quantity and quality of humor/comedic relief. Action scenes are plentiful and decently done, albeit repetitive and a bit predictable. Characters have endearing moments, and I am hoping this'll have some serious character development, which is why I'll keep watching.The plotline and worldbuilding remind me of Fairy Tail, and the main character seems, in my opinion, a cross between Naruto and FT's Natsu. (For example, the main character repeats a mantra: ""I'm going to be Wizard King"" instead of ""I'm going to be Hokage."") These aren't necessarily bad things, nor are they necessarily the responsibility of the screenwriters; I haven't read or looked at the original manga, so it might just be evidence of the typical tropes—clichés?—used in the shōnen genre.Similarly, most of the usual issues I have with shōnen anime are here. Script and plotline are predictable; in-episode recap/flashbacks are excessively repetitive, lengthy, and unnecessary. Main character's energy/excitement isn't endearing, but usually obnoxious (particularly, as noted in other comments, his tendency to yell his life's goal at every opportunity). Side characters seem more or less diverse and humorous, but their backstories (if any) rely on repetitious flashbacks and their development is rather flat. Villains aren't believable or relatable; their motives and backstories are often trite. Context and backstories are redundant, excessive, and often timed poorly: i.e., almost immediately after an issue has been raised, not allowing for buildup or viewer intuition. Because of their repetitive nature, flashbacks tend to detract from/interrupt the flow of the main story rather than adding insight. I am unsure whether the aforementioned tactics are annoying simply because I don't fall under the demographics for their predicted audience. The cover artwork and exposition at the beginning of each episode imply an older teen to young adult audience, perhaps 15+, but the show's current structure and lack of real character development/issues makes me believe the demographics of their projected audience actually are young (9-14?) boys. As I am a female university graduate, I don't fall under either umbrella and can concede some mismatch between their strategies and my reception of the show; however, I know plenty of 9-14 boys who'd be annoyed be the presumptions made here, who are capable of following complex plots, who are able to remember something shown only once, and who appreciate fast-moving plots with three-dimensional, rather than stereotypical or static, characters. Note about Time Usage: It takes, on average, five minutes into each episode before we get beyond the exposition, title song, and recaps to actually start moving forward with the actual episode. This means that, combined with the end credits and backend stuff that take abt two and a half min, 30 percent of the episode's allotted time is essentially wasted. This, too, is typical of other shōnen I've watched, but it's still annoying, particularly with the aforementioned complaints of repetitiveness during the other 70 percent and an already-short time frame.--tl,dr: 22 episodes in, I'm still unsure who this show is geared towards and how it differs significantly from other shōnen like Fairy Tail and Naruto (aside from setting). I am often exasperated with the characters' stagnation and lack of development for both characters and plot. It has a decent set of characters with potential for juicy development, and plenty of action/fight scenes, which is why I watch it, but thus far I haven't seen anything that makes it particularly better or worse than other shows within the genre.--UPDATE 12/30/2018. So, I took a break from Black Clover after episode 24 for a variety of reasons, then I watched episode 63 today just to see how much anything had changed. In summary: not much. Despite having skipped over nearly 40 episodes (which is worth more than 3 seasons/cours for a regular anime?), there was little to no maturation in the MC, the side characters were all still rather useless and entirely/hopelessly dependent on the main character to win the Big Boss Battle™, whose villain, again, didn't seem all that fleshed out, and it really didn't seem to matter that I skipped 40 episodes, because a lot of time was dedicated to recapping/flashbacking to all of the relevant details needed to understand what was going on. Personally, I am of the opinion that a good anime should trust the viewer to remember relevant details, to create substantial character development in 3 seasons' worth of material, and maybe even make the viewer feel like they missed something important if they skip over 40 episodes. As Black Clover has fulfilled none of these requirements, I am officially taking it off the queue, removing 1 star from my rating, and not looking back.",2
black-clover,"So I only made it through until the end of the third episode before Asta's constant yelling and screaming at EVER LITTLE THING made me delete this from my Queue and write this review. And I don't write reviews. The story seemed like it was going to be alright, and probably would be if the main character ACTUALLY NEEDED LOWERCASE IN HIS SUBS, holy hell WHY did they even bother putting his subs in lowercase ALL HE DOES IS YELL AND SCREAM. Excuse me while I now go and try to remove my brain with a plastic spoon to be able to forget about the excessive idiocy I TRIED to watch.",3
black-clover,"As many have mentioned Asta's shouting is for lack of a better word, the apocalyptic shouts from hell. He SHOUTS EVERYTHING. he does not talk he shouts. That's how he talks. Yes there's also some pretty annoying flashbacks AND like most shonen, the show dumbs down explanations (do keep in mind, these shows are targeted to young teens) so mayyyyybe that's why......However, the show does get better. Does it entertain me: yesAre the characters actually interesting: yes, very much specially the black bulls. Is Asta the only one that will be shouting a lot: Unfortunately no. Magna and Asta typically will resonate with each other's shouts. Is there a fun underlying plot: YES YES! Does the action improve: Yes it definitely does. The most interesting thing to me is the Magic Cast system this show sets up. Yes we've seen many magic shows and this one lacks some originality, but I do love the magic cast system. Those with little magic are considered trash by those who have a lot of magic. You're born into your class, it's very hard for poor people to make it to the top. Those in the lower end of the social class spectrum are expendable. From my perspective, this is the one thing that makes the show be kind of dark. On the surface the plot is just about Asta and his much more achieving childhood friend/brother (sort of). They both aim to become the Pirate King.....oh wait..no that's not right, The Wizard (magic) King...yeah yeah. So they have a fun rivalry and the first, Id' say 6 episodes, spend a long long time setting this up. The episodes past the Knight examination, are actually very fun. This is where the show picks up plot wise, fun wise, and action wise. They introduce a whole lot of fun and diverse characters. The humor gets better. The action gets better. AND they FINALLY explain that Asta's persistent shouting, is actually PLOT related. No it doesn't give him superpowers (at least I don't think it does), but the other characters that are introduced will constantly complain about his loud demeanor and consistent shouting. So there you have it, he's been intended to be that loud. I've never read the Manga, but those who have seem to tell me it's really good. So it seems they made him loud, because plot wise, he is supposed to be loud. It's supposed to be one of those characteristic you hate about someone, however, later you will find yourself confused as to how you could possible come to like such an obnoxious character. Because I do. Once we hit Ep. 9 I realized I liked Asta. Loud and all. Sometimes it's still annoying, but I've come to like and respect his overall design. Maybe those in the orphanage were just used to him (or deaf) by the beginning of the show....which is why they made it seem normal in the first few episodes....On a different topic the underlying plot is pretty interesting to me. Who are Asta and Yuno really? Why were they abandon?What's the deal with the anti birds?Etc. etc.I think any show that has me wondering about the unknown is actually pretty good. I want to keep watching to see if they'll answer those. While hoping it will actually be an interesting answer. It's not a solid 5 star.  So far for me it's a 4.5, but I gave it the 5 because of the social injustices presented, and I like those kinds of story. They can get deep and dark. The show is just starting out too, so I think we can give it a chance for a while longer. It could very well be a classic someday after it gets over the startup bumps.",4
black-clover,"Aside from the long wind-up of the first 4-5 episodes. I would recommend this show to anyone! It's fresh and the anime hasn't been made too flashy which is rather nostalgic in of itself, showing off the older style of animation. The story takes a few episodes to really kickoff and only after the later episodes does the story start to take hold of you and have meaning. It's an evolving plot that will leave most wanting more and more each episode the finish. Highly Recommend this!",4
black-clover,"If you're the type of person that you dont have the time or patience to be able to give an anime a few episodes to kick off, i TOTALLY get that. Asta's screaming bothering you i can totally get too.  But it definitely does pick up, theres a bit of character development and i mean its nothing amazing but its just solid and knows its audience kinda thing. If you liked fairytail, this you'd probably dig.",2
black-clover,"This show is bad. Not for the strawman reasons you think people hate it for either; eg character voice, rip off. No. This show is bad because of the 3 to 4 minute plus intros, the heavy reuse of scenes(much more noticeable in this dungeon ark...impossible to not notice actually), and the unneeded exposition that's thrown at us every episode.  Oh, I forgot what Asta doesn't have can you please remind me show? Ridiculous.  The story is enjoyable but the nonsense they pull in showing it to us is not. Never in my several thousands of hours of anime watching have I seen something so blatantly unapologetic about showing as little content as they do with this show each episode. (Mostly starting in this dungeon ark). I pray this doesn't become a trend.",1
black-clover,"The first and worst part of this show is the main character's voice. I can understand wanting to give him a bit of an annoying voice, but Jesus. His voice basically makes the show unwatchable anyways. It took me multiple tries to get through the first episode because i have never heard such a terrible voice in my life. Beyond that, the writing is, in my own opinion, kinda terrible. That's just a personal thing though; I realize some people might think the story is fine. But for people who do like the story there is just so much filler (compared to the manga). I have never seen a show with so much filler relative to its source material.",1
black-clover,Watched up to episode 12 have noted some clique characters and situations and the story isn't anything new but I do like the premise. Asta's voice actors having to yell most of his lines is a bit annoying but you either put up with it or you don't. I do like the many powers and most of the characters are likeable the music is pretty good and it is paced pretty well and so far their hasn't been too much fan service which doesn't bother me but may bug others. I'm giving a low 4 on here and a 7 on a 1 to 10 scale I'll keep up with it and would give it a mild recommendation. Adding more as the series has gotten better they've pretty much stopped most of the yelling and began to concentrate on the story and development of the various teams they were picked to join so I'm going to up my rating to a high 4 and a 8.0 on a 10 scale. Getting pass the first season is a trial but gets better after that.,4
black-clover,"I got to see this one just cus' I got bored, and I already knew about this anime, but never caught my attention, then I was on steam and I wanted to try the Streaming service on it, (which was bad btw) and I watched the first episode, I said that the first episode was pretty bad, but I gave it a chance because it was the first episode, its strange to see an anime that is already all in the first episode, so a couple of days later I saw the second one, it was slow, but SLOW but it gave me the idea that everything is just so people understand the backstory, and I don't complain, then I watched the third one, things got a little better (a little) and after that, 4 and beyond things are more ok, the cons of the anime are the OBNOXIOUS screams of Asta, and that I could predict alot of things, but out of that it was good, even for me, that Shounen is one of the genres that aren't my hit, but it was ok ; )EDIT: also, I don't see the similarity with naruto, and it makes me cringe sometimes...",3
black-clover,"Black Clover doesn't really do anything new or particularly well. The voice acting is annoying until you develop Stockholm Syndrome and begin to simply accept it. It's set in a very generic fantasy world where the fact that everyone uses magic for everything is simply mentioned but not pursued to make it interesting. Asta is bad at everything else but having the power of Anti-Magic and superhuman battle senses; hoo-boy, that's the exact counter to magic users, go figure. Very predictable and full of tired tropes. It's not the worst thing by any means but it's so full of mediocrity that I just can't recommend it to anyone. (Also read the manga and it's slightly better but still 2/5)",2
black-clover,"If you're watching this hoping for something new and original, that you've never experienced before, don't. This show is as bland as bland can be. Asta (main protagonist) who can't use magic, want's to become the very best, in fact, he wants to become Hokage! oops I meant Wizard King, easy mistake. Obviously it's more than just this one example, but I do think it demonstrates my point to some degree. One little thing I've noticed while watching this show, was Asta's constant yelling. It is so soooooo annoying, every word he says has this intense vibrato, and he usually follows that up, with a long scream. It's not funny, it's not endearing, it's annoying. What's worse is the show recognizes how annoying it is, and the characters will even joke about it! It's not funny! Just please stop! Please! Asta is the main character, he speaks at least 90% of the time! It's time to STOP. Another thing that bugs me is the repeated jokes and gags. It's not that bad,  but it is repetitive, especially when the jokes weren't funny to begin with. This actually leads into another criticism perfectly.Filler, filler is to be expected with a show like this. However, Black Clover takes filler to a whole other level, and there is no good reason. Scenes that barley took up 2 panels in the manga,  can last up to 1 minute in this anime. This leads to the show feeling like it's moving at a snails pace, as well as we get more of Asta's constant yelling, and the repeated jokes. Another problem, the animation is kinda crappy, you'll mostly be looking at stills of characters. This isn't really anything out of the ordinary for a weekly show like this though. Luckily, if you turn of your brain, you might just make it to episode 8. I couldn't watch further than that. I still have nightmares of Asta's yelling. I can't recommend this show to anybody.",5
black-clover,"I have many issues with the show. First, and the most obvious, is the migraine inducing scream of the protagonist. While on episode 9 this still bugs me, it has become a 'bearable'(???) noise I learned to live with. The biggest problem in this show is the garbage pacing. Recently I heard the manga was not awful. I am shounen trash, so I read it. The pacing is incredibly fast, which I thought was amazing. Maybe an arc lasted, at most, 7-10 chapters and it moved to the next arc. This anime takes it sweet time getting to the first arc, which sort of starts in episode 8 but really begins in episode 9. The first half of the episodes are typically filler. I'm going to let that settle in. FILLER. In a 12 episode anime. This reminds me of a shounen airing in 2007. It is like they are gearing up to catch up to the manga super quickly. There are 130 plus chapters out. For a seasonal anime that will come out once a year, they will not catch the manga anytime soon. At this pace they will catch the manga when One Piece ends. Take My Hero Academia, this keeps pace with the manga and is still nowhere near catching it. I know My Hero does have like 30 more chapters than Black Clover but that does not matter.My recommendation is to just read the manga because this is painfully slow. I sit and skip through the filler which is about 11:00 minutes of the episode. Is this the new 'King of Shounen'? No. Is the manga a fun and decent read? Yes. Just read it because it really should not be this bad.",5
black-clover,"I never review these things but this was just such a waste. The premise was pretty good and I was really exited to start it but it was just one big disappointment. The show is unoriginal and basically just a big mash of every major shounen, Asta is just a more annoying version of Naruto, the characters are also extremely similar to the twins from blue exorcist, and the setting for them knight exam is basically the town of beginnings. Don't even get me started on Asta's yelling I think im deaf now. I can't even take him seriously he is basically comedic relief and that really is a hindrance from identifying with him and his backstory. The good action and animation is not enough to save this.",2
black-clover,"Asta, the main character, constantly screams and excessively stresses his A's. It's extremely distracting and detracting from this anime. I've found myself muting the volume more frequently with each passing episode, especially when he chains the elongated A's together in several words in sentence.If he wasn't the main character, I could tolerate it but he has tonnes of dialogue and, therefore, compounds the issue.I'm not sure why the producer thought this was a good idea to carry forward but it REALLY detracts from what seems to be a good anime.",5
black-clover,"These writers apparently have no idea how to do something subtle and have no idea how pacing works. They have Asta scream everything which is annoying and repeat themselves and their themes over a dozen times in the first few episodes. The amount of times they reference/have him scream his dream and that not giving up is his magic is so annoying do it once if you suck at writing or show us instead of just having the character scream it every 5 seconds. Also their pacing is awful, the manga moves fast which is nice but this anime moves two times slower than the manga which is unusual to say the least. This could have been fine if they were building their characters depth or laying the groundwork for some big reveal or not being so explicit with their themes but still wanted to get them across. But instead most of the length comes from they slowing everything from the manga down fro no reason and repeating themselves over and over again and I'm not just talking about repeating dialogue, which they do, they literally re show scenes over and over again just to take up a quarter of the new episodes run time and then waste the rest on useless info not in the manga or some gimmick. I like the show and if it had just kept a nice pace and not screamed every single thought the writers had at me I would be happy to watch it.But its like these  writers are in kindergarten and don't understand subtext or realize that we can remember what happened in the last episode and remember the demon scene they show every other episode for no other reason than to waste time. They already only have 24 min to move the plot alone but they waste half that on repetition making it feel so slow and boring.",4
black-clover,"I'm not sure if it gets better, but it just seams too loud. This is comming from an avid one piece fan, but the main character just seems stupid only to be stupid, and the character designs aren't too unique. I mean, Luffy is dumb, but he is also smart (in his own way). This main guy just looks to be dumb overall, so I don't feel connected to him, I feel no sympathy for him (because he's kinda a dick) and I don't feel invested at all.",4
black-clover,"Expect the shonen troupes: underdog-tsundere-harem MC with powerful unknown dark powers, in a wizard fantasy setting.This anime is incredibly slow paced with plenty of in-episode-fillers that needlessly drag the shows progress in (almost, if not) every aspect. Slower than it's contemporary competitors, and slower still even compared to older shows. The show's slow pace is even more emphasized when compared/contrasted to it's manga, which is incredibly fast paced.POSSIBLY redeemable only with high quality animation for main plot-point battles to compensate for the drag. If you enjoy the find that you enjoy the show for it's content, I suggest you read the manga instead. But if you prefer anime over manga as a media, well, I hope you enjoy the show.I'd give the manga 9/10, and the anime 3-4 /10",1
black-clover,"see I love the manga, Its totally worth reading. I actually watched the first episode before starting to read the manga...and one thing I could tell you is that the voice actor for the main character yells...So. Much. My ears were aching! and I felt a bit frustrated! I didnt even watch past 7 mins before I gave up and went to read the manga. and it was ok but I gotta say, just because the guy's dialogue is in  BIG AND BOLD LETTERING  doesn't mean to  Scream On Top Of Your Lungs!!!!  That is all the issue I have for now. I am updated on the manga and kinda get the gist of the story so I'm going back to the anime and see if I can look past the horrible voice acting.",5
black-clover,"Characters are utterly one dimensional, every turn of the story is entirely predictable, dialogue is just... bad.This is all pretty unfortunate because the concept itself sounds good as an elevator pitch: ""Kid with no magic wants to be king in a world where everyone has magic. Try as he might, he doesn't have a chance until a demonic grimoire changes everything.""It's really too bad that what came out of that idea is more like: ""Really dumb kid with no indoor voice or magic wants to be king in a world where everyone has magic. With the power of friendship and an extremely overpowered mcguffin he gets in the first episode it won't be too hard.""",5
black-clover,"THAT IS THE WAY THIS CHARACTER SPEAKS. JUST ONE GIANT SCREAM THROUGH THE WHOLE THING. NEVER HAVE I EVER BEEN SO CERTAIN AFTER 1 EPISODE THAT AN ANIMOO WAS BAD. THE MAIN CHARACTER DOES NOTHING BUT SCREAM IN THE SAME MANNER OVER AND OVER LIKE SOME 13TH CENTURY MONK CHANTING. THE CADENCE IS THE SAME. SCREAM A LINE, AND DRAG OUT THE LAST SYLLABLE WHILE ENDING IN AN UPWARD INFLECTION. THE STORY FLIES BY ANY INTERESTING CHARACTER BUILDING IN YOUTH AND RUSHING US INTO THE AMAZING REVEAL THAT THE UNUSUAL MAIN CHARACTER WHO HAS NO MAGIC, SUDDENLY HAS THE MOST POWERFUL MAGIC BOOK EVER. WOOOOOAH. SADLY THIS REVELATION IS STUNTED BY THE FACT THAT HE PROBABLY DIDN'T NEED TO, AND THE FACT THAT THEY DIDN'T INVEST THE TIME IN MAKING ME UNDERSTAND HOW THIS REALITY IMPACTED HIS LIFE UP UNTIL NOW.GARBAGE CHARACTERS OVERALL, RUSHED STORY, MAIN CHARACTER HAS THE WORST VOICE EVER AND I'M SURE HIS VOICE ACTOR HATES HIMSELF FOR BEING FORCED TO DELIVER LINES THAT WAY, AND IF NOT, HE SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF HIMSELF. SADLY THE ANIMATION AND ART IS REALLY WELL DONE, WHICH SUCKS BECAUSE THIS SHOW IS JUST AWFUL AND WASTING THE TALENT OF GOOD PEOPLE.THIS IS BAD BY CLICHE SHOUNEN STANDARDS. WATCH LITERALLY ANYTHING ELSE ANYONE HAS EVER TOLD YOU TO WATCH EVER. I'D GIVE THIS A HALF STAR IF I COULD.",5
black-clover,"Insted of episodes at a good pace with the ocassional filler episode, this series feels like it has entire sections in EVERY episode be fillers. Can't remember the last time I watched a series move along this slow with so much inconsequential content.Character development is needed, but the way this series does it seems almost annoying with substantial parts of episodes dedicated to backstories instead of just doing enough to give us backround and move the story along.Doing this review as of episode 5 and will give it a few more episodes, but I am beginning to think this one may not be worth watching.Update: I gave it until episode 8 to see if anything would improve. Nothing improved and if anything I think it got worse.  I think they spent all their money on animators and must have ran out of money for the writer(s) because it is just plain awful how the story moves along so slowly.This is far as I go with this anime and changing from 2 star to 1 star.",1
black-clover,"I enjoy the anime however the pacing is way too slow. I understand there are gonna be 50 episodes and all, but if you are gonna have 6 minutes of theme songs and recaps, and then have the episode cut off at 20 minutes, then there really doesn't need to be 50 episodes. Every Tuesday I watch in hopes that I will see some real action, and every Tuesday I am disappointed with the outcome of the show. The fight scenes are way too short. I am tired of ""learning"" about the characters, I learn about them when I see them fight. I want to see some really evil villains and I want to see Asta and Yuno evolve. I also want to see romance, and deep tragedy, and the recovering that comes after the tragedy. I want to see emotions other than happy all the time. I just wish there was more. It feels like this anime is missing a lot of stuff.",1
black-clover,"Edit: As the series progresses I found myself laughing my ass off... Therefore I had no choice but to raise my rating from a 4/5 to a 5/5!(Also i feel as though Asta will mellow out a little bit down the road because of the way he acted ""afew times"" since joining his guild.)The anime seems to have a great concept and I cant wait to see what comes nxt!The only issue I seem to have with it so far is: Every time ""Asta"" opens his mouth he puts most banshees to shame with that screech of his...(I hope to hear his voice mature a little in the near future)",2
black-clover,"Take this budget Naruto out to the trash where it belongs. The main character is shrill and unlikable, the plot and world-building gets thrown at your face at light speed, and half the plot is spoonfed to you by side characters. Everything about this anime seems to be a carbon copy of Naruto, from the moody and rude antagonist to the spiky haired, dimwitted and loud main character with the simple goal of becoming the best despite the fact that he's talentless. I really wanted to like this anime because of the promising trailer, but the way it's looking now there's hardly a chance I'll give even the second episode a view.",2
black-clover,"My Ears hurt bad enough from listening to the episode 1 MC that I hopped off this episode multiple times wondering how it got such good reviews. Then, I saw the phenomenal plot development of the show and saw that it had great potential. However, unless that MC voice changes (actor changed) or gets his shrill/screeching ""voice"" usage minimized, I will be forced to either watch the animation on mute or read & rate the manga and leave an even worse review here. I have seen anime fix small errors like this and develop into something great... but I'm not convinced it will happen until it does.",4
dr-stone,"For the first episode, I was happy to see the manga come to life. The animations are quite pleasant and it builds an expectation for viewers. While it can feel underwhelming for some, it is important to note human innovation and technology development throughout most of history was relatively slow. It's only recently we've made rapid advances. As a result, Dr. STONE starts all over in the stone age, so expect a slow brew. But the show hits conflict points and major drivers in the story including significant character development, it will be worth the wait.So far a great start and LOVE the beautiful soundtrack from Tatsuya Kato  (composer for Food Wars, Free!, Revue Starlight).",4.5
dr-stone,"I've been trying to find a decent series to watch after having finished gate and I've been trodding through multiple series but nothing has been able to land a hook.Finally, after a few days of nothing to watch, I came across Dr. Stone. I guess i'm genuinely interested in the series since science is one of my passions (even though a lot of things are incorrect in the series) and the show displays the limitless potential of humans (something I believe in to the extreme). Through science, anything can be achieved.The series is quite interesting as you're left wondering what Senku will work on next or how things are progressing. I highly recommend those that are on the fence to watch a couple episodes to see if the hook lands and catches your attention.9/10",5
dr-stone,Based off the first episode I can already tell how amazing this anime is going to be. There is so much that goes into this show and I cant wait to see how much more they add. Besides the awesome concept the one thing I personally LOVE about this show that not many shows I have watched take advantage of is the power of time-skips. The amount of content and story progression they can fit into a single episode with out it feeling rushed or drawn out over the course of 12 episodes (DBZ) is amazing. From the first episode you already get such well done story progression and satisfaction and yet it leaves me craving more of it. This show has AMAZING potential.,5
dr-stone,"Senku! Senku! Senku! Senku!Abstract attempts at not spoiling below:Everything about this anime is unique and exhilarating. It's not an ""alternate world"" anime like so many have been over the last few seasons, but it gives you that feel of exploring a new reality. And the oh so healthy approach of learning from patient observation and repeated experimentation is such a relief from the standard Shounen trope of BASH HEAD AGAINST WALL UNTIL I WIN THE FIGHT.We need more science in anime, that's all I'm saiyan.",5
dr-stone,"After 'being reincarnated as a slime' we saw numerous garbage level isekais. Dr. Stone is a completely fresh, new and all around great outlook on the things we already know. OP characters from, you could say, 'another world'. General mix of fresh characters and lore around the show isn't sold short by the animations and interactions. More importantly, the goal of the series remains intact as the story proceeds. A big thank you.",5
dr-stone,"When I first started this show right when it came out, it seemed like an interesting enough concept to warrant watching a few episodes. It does seem slow at first, but it is very deliberate and it tells such a deep story not only about the phenomenon, but it also tells a story about one who overcomes the seemingly impossible through the application of science. It retells the story of how we came to be now technologically -- how through persistence, perseverance, and patience -- science and its building blocks can step by step lead us to a better world. The story of course is post apocalyptic but it is a hopeful, more light hearted sci-fi anime. As you progress through the story it does get better and better and grows in humor while learning about cool science things. I honestly don't care much for sci-fi animes as they are usually just, weird. But this one is an exception.I appreciate how intentional the anime is. It has very good pacing in the story and in taking its time in moments to captivate the audience and help them to appreciate the variety of characters and what they bring to the story.Definitely recommend.",5
dr-stone,"The Mystery of the Petrification and the mystery of its undoing is extremely interesting, and captivated me long enough to get intrigued in the story. The main character is extremely smart and quick-witted, although being an ass at times, and his friends provide an interesting foil to his character. The main villains goals are kind of blurry in his logic, but he is intimidating enough to keep the main characters on edge, owing a lot to the performance of the voice actor who also voiced Bruno Buccelati in Jojo's Bizarre Adventure. Over all its a really good show i would recommend to my friends, and i recommend you check it out too.",5
dr-stone,"Make no mistake, Dr. Stone is a shounen series. But that’s ok! The shounen formula is good, and the use of it here is novel and fresh; with each new “power up” being a leap forward in technology. The usual tropes are present, but they are easy to overlook due to how relaxed the show takes itself. The cast are likeable, their goals are clear, and seeing what the future has in store for them is an exciting prospect.",5
dr-stone,"At first, I was like... ""Everyone's stone? wtf..."" I seriously thought it was gonna suck. Turns out this has amazing character's, great twists, and can actually teach a couple things about science. I just wish it wouldn't leave you on such a cliff hanger!My only complaint is how stupid they made the main bad guy. The whole ""kill all old people because they must be evil"" mentality, is absolutely ridiculous. Like, does the dude not know that people grow up? Is he an evil version of Peter Pan!? Ugh, but other than the villain being a book-smart moron, the show is still amazingly good.",5
dr-stone,"This show is in my top 10 anime of all time just on the merit of they use  REAL SCIENTIFIC FACTS!!! Being someone who loves an appreciates science I was instantly sucked in. The show starts off in estimated 2019 and a weird beam of green light sends the world into a literal ""stone age"" only affecting humans and sparrow birds. Senku the genius is the 1st human in the stone age to wake up and figure out what is going on with world, how to survive, and how to create things that were common in the world he knew. From there you are sucked into an adventure of science and discovery.I absolutely regret not watching this show sooner. Now, I am hooked and currently waiting for season 2!!!!!",5
dr-stone,"Humanity has spent thousands upon thousands of years advancing little by little from just playing with rocks to doing something as crazy as landing on the moon. What would happen if all of that was stripped away from us? What if, every human was turned to stone and forced to wait thousands of years to awake again? Would we be able to rebuild the society of our past? Would we want to? Dr. Stone explores these questions through an extremely knowledgeable and scientific boy named Senku, who wishes to take humanity back to the space age. He'll face hurdles though: conflicting ideologies, ignorance, and time will all be playing against him. Does he have what it takes, or will his mistakes end up hurting him and the ones he care about? Find out next time on DRRRRR.sSTOOOONEEEEE",5
dr-stone,This show rocks. It's really one for the ages. It wasn't hard coming up with these puns. All jokes aside this is a really good show! Who would have thunk Bill Nye the science guy would get his own anime as a kid! Ok I am done with the bad jokes and will review honestly.This show has an amazing art style that flows very smoothly. So many good shows have come out this year and this is one of my favorites! If you like apocalyptic type stories and science this is a show for you!,4.5
dr-stone,"I have never seen an anime that made me interested in scientific discoveries like this before. This show goes heavily into real science incorporated brilliantly into a survival type story. I love the manga, and even though I know what will happen in the story I still enjoy watching the episodes as they come out to hear the voices and see the colors. Absolutely one of the best anime airing right now.",4.5
dr-stone,"I see many people comparing the show to the manga, of course they can do so! However, many people do not know what the manga is like, so lemme lay it down. Have you ever wanted a show, where you wanted to continue watching it, and stop halfway only to realise your brain is wanting more? No? Well um, this is awkward cause this is that show! it makes you wanna see more! the dialogue is almost geniune, its animations are pleasant to the eyes, and its story is very, very good. I recomend anybody with some free time to binge watch this starting now, you will not regret it!",5
dr-stone,"TL;DR:  Some tiny problems, sure... but enjoy it for what it is: entertainment.  Also, wow!  That art!  <3This is outstanding art, first off.  I love every bit from character design strangeness on the MC (that hair, though!) to the great landscapes.  I don't know how hard it is to draw all of the details in those drama shots of muscles and power poses but I know for sure they were worth the artists' time because wow.When it comes to story/plot... Anyone can tell you there are a few hang-ups in the depictions of things or loopholes in 'but really, that wouldn't work' logic but let's get real.  Do you watch anime for educational purposes?  PfffffThis whole story is one huge feel-good.  There's overpowered combat that makes hardly any logical sense (kill a lion with one punch teenager?) and crazy circumstances that have no explanation (yet?) but if you accept that it's not over and keep watching to see where the story goes and what happens next instead of getting caught up in the minor details, it's just a fantastic watch.",5
dr-stone,This anime actually teaches you things while still having the same epic vibe as a top notch shounen anime. Ever since it came out it has been my favorite of the season and one of my personal all time preferred. This show is the only one that has me looking forward to every friday. I've felt the urge to simply read the manga and find out myself of everything that is going to happen but I can't help it but not do it because Dr. Stone has to be enjoyed on the best way possible which would be anime in my case,5
dr-stone,"I expected to like this show, but I didn't expect to absolutely love it!It's my favorite of its season! I enjoy Fire Force, but I feel like I love Dr. Stone just a little more!I really hope this show can start a civilization-building surge, like how isekai anime did.It's so fun learning the different lessons that Senku teaches, and relearning some ""basic"" science as well as more advanced science!The show is on episode 11 right now; I can't wait for more!",4
dr-stone,"When I watched the first few episodes I'll admit I found both of the major characters a little annoying, but then after I got to really see their true characters, I actually really like them, much more than a typical anime's MC type, the ones who use the constant ""talk no Jutsu"" and ""I'll make stupid choices but it will work out because goals and ill be the wizard king!!!!"". This one though, he's completely logical and I'm not saying that just to go with what the characters keep saying, obviously sometimes there are a few leaps of logic, but its an anime... But as I said, he's not solely going after some grand goal while abandoning all kinds of logic, he's the first protagonist who doesn't feel like a dumbass past being some ""sTrAtIgIcAl GeNiOuS"", and the reasons for why he's so smart goes beyond just natural talentThe thing I find most appealing about it though, is, at least what I see as its main theme, the idea that you CAN do grand things, and you DON'T need to be stupid about it, I cannot stand when I see a character get away with being stupid for plot reasons and they still get labeled as an inspirational icon, I've never been as inspired watching naruto than when he first made light, or I've never genuinely felt happy when Goku reached a new form, but I was literally jittery when they finally finished the antibiotic, then i hit a pit when i thought it was all for nothing, then it was another high when it was actually shown to work, I'm not saying this show is better than all of the OGs for that reason, and there are OBVIOUS examples of older anime doing this as well, but this is just a bit of fresh air compared to the vast majorityAll this being said, it does have some flaws, like the ""fake-out death"" thing was kind of eh, and some jokes with the weird faces go on a tad bit too long, and I can see this being one of those anime that are good, but people will overhype it and that may ruin the experience for some, which i just have to hope doesn't happen.Either way, it was absolutely worth my time watching, and I'm very glad I did watch it, i also really do think the messages it has constantly throughout the show are amazing for younger kids to watch if they happen to come across this anime, even going as far as touching on that taboo of someone being a bad guy, but not a necessarily bad person, and the whole show is basically expressing that even tiny progress is progress, as early as episode 2.I just want to stress one more time that i think they wrote the MC near perfect, he's genuinely inspiring in his high moments withOUT the grand speeches, just putting in his work and improving the lives of everyone around him, and even actively telling people not to thank him, it's weird how much a digital and functional character can make ME, watching on a computer screen, feel relieved when light is finally achieved. He's not even held back by the complaint of ""he didn't fully earn his success, he had some op broken mechanic that got him there, the most powerful quirk, a tailed beast, or is all of the op races, We're shown why he's smart, we're shown how he gradually got smarter, and we're shown what his father did to help him along the way, the father that HE inspired which got him those benefits in the first place, so his knowledge is absolutely not unearned, and every advancement is gotten slowly and progress is always stressed to be grueling, every single thing he got, he did himself with the tools everyone has and at times even less.Now that im done with by book/rant, im just going to leave it off by saying its not the BEST, but it is FAR from average and is not a waste of time, even flashbacks long enough to make naruto blush aren't painful, they are heartwarming and enjoyable, but it DOES have its flaws, so 9.5/10 for me",5
dr-stone,"but that's the engineer in me. It still was a fun ride from Fred Flintstone to cellphones.While parts of the plot struck me as unbelievable, I was able to get my Helmet of Disbelieve tuned in to a good wave length, and enjoyed what was, otherwise, a well put together narrative. Logic, initiative and perseverance win the day in this title, rather than brute strength, magic or deception.There's a wide variety of characters, both protagonist and antagonist, that have well defined designs. I like most of the artwork for them, although I do wonder if Senku isn't an escapee from a Yugio episode with that hair. I love the little girl with the melon head. Kawaii! The main characters get some decent development, and even some of the secondary character do as well. In fact, the entire village, where the story occurs, gets an interesting backstory. I do think it would have been better to have rounded things out a little better by giving us some more on the main antagonist and what made him tick, though. The background artwork kind of ran the gamut from alright to looks real good. The animation also runs a gamut. In a couple spots it's real good, but in more spots I would have to say it gets dangerously close to kid-vid. It all comes out in the wash as an average effort. Voice acting is average to slightly above. Mostly it is fine, but there are a few scenes where the emotional content in the Japanese struck me as a little over the top. It wasn't enough to become aggravating, though.Direction was OK if not inspired as well. No big chances taken here. There were some instances that I thought were minor annoyances, but over all it wasn't distracting to the story. As a whole I found Dr. Stone a worthwhile project, and could easily recommend it to anyone that might find the premise compelling. I'd rate it an 82/100. A solid 4 stars.",5
dr-stone,"Everyone has a fridge. Or a phone. Or some electronic. And honestly, old devices are taken for granted. But we have no idea how they work. Just that they do. (Some people might look into it on their own, but generally that's more advanced stuff.) Dr. Stone really opens your eyes up to what we take for granted by starting from scratch and making everything new again. It really is an awesome show with good in-depth characters and struggles.",5
dr-stone,"Dr. Stone is an amazing show, and I really like it. I got into the series because my friend told me about it, and it became a binge. I'll go into details below:Plot:The plot of Dr. Stone is definitely the best part of it. It goes into detail about science and technology development, but that doesn't make it boring. The idea is super original which makes the series more enjoyable. It's easy to follow but it's still extremely interesting. I'd rate the plot a 5 out of 5. Characters:I don't really like the characters that much. The main character is kind of annoying. However, that doesn't make the series bad or anything. You can definitely come to enjoy the personalities of the other characters that show up later in the show, and I think their talents and weaknesses make the plot keep moving forward. I rate the characters a 3.5 out of 5.Development:I haven't been in the fandom for very long of Dr. Stone, but I think they're still working on it and making new episodes. I can't give it anything under a 5 star rating as I haven't finished the show yet, but I do think they're making new episodes and there's definitely plenty to watch. I'll rate the development a 5 out of 5.Music:The music isn't anything special but it isn't bad, either. I've never heard a song and thought that it was bothersome and the intros don't bother me, either. I wouldn't give it under a 5, because it doesn't really bother me too much. This is the second anime I've watched, but I think my judgement of the music is pretty accurate. I'd rate the music a 5 out of 5.",5
dr-stone,"I finished it so its not terrible, but its no where near the realm of true 5 star anime like Stein's gate or even better constructed comedies such as Konosuba or Hinamatsuri. Sometimes are done well, like the main character's established as a genius and you've no reason to doubt that throughout the story. He makes smart choices not typical dumb anime ones. The premise of the anime however leaves a lot to be desired and the further into the anime you get the worse it seems and the less sense it makes. Its anime, so you forgive sometimes, but if you're trying to use the real world as your setting and not something fantasy related then you use real world rules. Thats how it works. Not terrible, but overall it goes very slow, there are lots of cringy moments I had to skip and the science plot holes knock this down to a 3/5. Its very popular, for some reason, but you could spend your time better with a hundred other shows.",5
dr-stone,"What I watch for this season is that the people on Earth turn into Stone including the protagonist Senku and his friends. Over 3700 years later Senku is the first person to be unpetrified and he is on the way to revive humanity. But first Senku needs to survive such as shelter, finding for food, making science things, looking for people like Taiju to work for him, then eventually, he finds a tribal village to continue making his kingdom of science, and that's how the story goes on.Other than that this Science Anime is such a masterpiece and I love watching it every single episode of it. It follows the source of Manga frequently and amazingly animated like ever before. So, therefore, without a doubt that this anime is beautiful in terms of the story, background, and even the effects too.This anime is surely definitely watching it see for yourself and I recommend you for that if you are looking for some great science anime like this.",5
dr-stone,"I just finished watching all episodes of Dr Stone and let me tell you - it was a wild, bloody worthwhile ride! I have recently gotten back into watching anime because I experienced a dry spell, of boring, unoriginal, heartless anime, but this anime (along with a handful of other recent works) have reminded me why I love it so much. Dr Stone is original, imaginative (yet realistic), heart-warming and hilarious. I can't think of any way to improve it. I never thought I'd enjoy it so much, I hope season 2 follows in its footsteps. I highly recommend everyone to give this anime a chance, get past at least the first 3 episodes. I haven't cried, laughed and been so captivated so much in a long time, and I know you will too.",4.5
dr-stone,"Speaking as a long time anime fan, it's very very rare these days that a new show comes around and I don't immediately say ""it's another X"". Many of even the best anime share a lot of heavy similarities. But then we get Dr. Stone, with a remarkably original story that really lacks any direct comparisons. Without spoiling much of the plot Dr. Stone is, grossly oversimplified, a post apocalypse story. But that's about where the standard archetype ends. It has elements of a shonen action series without the super powered protagonist or violence focused plot line. It has sci-fi elements without impossible tech like FLT space ships or giant robots. It has creative humor, excellent story telling and is written with a balance of real world science and suspension of disbelief that's largely unmatched. The pacing, world building, character development and music are all on point and fantastic! Every episode leaves me dying to know what comes next! The music always does a great job of matching and emphasizing the tone of the scene. The author does a superb job of balancing a serious story with endlessly enjoyable humor and powerful emotional scenes that left me on the verge of tears more than once!Only downside is the art style. Several characters outright are so different that the seem to come from different artists and the MC has the worst case of protagonist hair since Yugioh... That said, after getting drawn into the story these complaints are quickly forgotten. Another minor critique is that, despite the show's reliance on real science there are a few glaring holes in the idea that some people wont be able to set aside. In the end, this series blew my mind and easily gets my vote for anime of the year 2019 despite some seriously good competition. I can't recommend it more highly, an absolute MUST WATCH! Pros:Truly original story.Great writing, pacing, character development and world building!Fantastic music and audio direction!A nearly perfect balance of serious story, humor and emotional scenes.Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideOh, and SEASON TWO CONFIRMED!Cons:Inconsistent and somewhat silly character design.Some glaring science plot holes.",4.5
dr-stone,"Probably the best anime of the end of the year.Refreshing, inspirational, cute, funny and so enjoyable.I must admit, I didn't know what to expect after the first episode but dear lord, this has been one of the best ride in a very long time.You get to see so many cool things, learn a lot and all of that with fun.The show is not also to centered about the main char which is very good.Bring on season 2 ASAP!",5
dr-stone,"I love the nerdy science side of this anime. It's serious and silly in a good mix, and the journey of making stuff far beyond their ability without Senku is really fun. Love this idea especially because it's focus is on science and the restoration of humankind, with cool action but not just full of fighting and ""training"" to be stronger, which I also love of course, but this is a refreshingly unique anime. Good job Crunchyroll. A+",5
dr-stone,"Facts on this Anime:- first 4 episodes are a tad slow- episodes 4 and on are AMAZING- character development is magnificent- main character is very impressive- like the main theme of this which is SCIENCE and really promoting education the importance of it.- story is well paced, well told and overall GREAT- All emotions exist in this anime: Drama, friendship, comedy and so far small romance here.- Intro\ Outro's to date are a little weak.- Reveals throughout the show are epic and fun to watch.- Worth your time to watch and binge right now.",5
dr-stone,"I watched this show based on my brother's recommendation and was suprised to find how enjoyable it was. Usually, I hold mixed feeling toward most animes/manga, so when I say that this was enjoyable, I mean it. The characterization is great, the plot is enticing, and the atmosohere is perfect. But, most important of all, the series has likeable characters, no matter how scummy. I've seen too many anime that tried and failed miserably to make their characters relatable or even, what I would consider, likable. I have to say, the villain reminds me heavily of Dio from JoJo's Bizzarre adventure - charasmatic, calm, swift, and deadly. Go watch Dr Stone if you haven't already.",5
dr-stone,"I started watching this series back when i was at my dorm. at first i was a bit hesitant to watch this but in the end it ended up being very good. Then i got back home and watched one episode on my laptop, my dad (who is very picky about anime) liked it too so i connected my comp with the tv and since then everyone at home is watching this. This is a must see anime, i've been recommending this to my friends and all of them like it. At times it serious, at times it's funny, it has a good balance between the two. The science parts are awesome too not too difficult and not too easy to understand just good enough for you to enjoy it. The story is awesome, we've got a villain who is great and a MC who is 10 billion percent awesome xD It's rare (for me) to actually have all these points being very good at the same time so for me this gets a 5/5. Definitely watch it, you won't regret it!",5
dr-stone,"This show has really blown my mind by how much I'm enjoying it. The start of it isn't even that slow, and it's still enjoyable, but when it picks up.. IT REALLY picks up. Wonderfully timed and unique humor, progression, adventure, emotion, music, and SCIENCE. So much entertaining science. I've cried more than I expected because of this show - because it's that good, and the timing of the music (and timing of lack of music) is so powerful.Great work. Very impressed.",5
dr-stone,"Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics. A needed part of the education and daily life made into an Anime.  An awesome anime to say the least. If you were to tell I would cheer and worry about a scientist I would call you crazy. Not since the passing of Stephen Hawkings have I care that much for science.  A dreaded theme in my formative years.  It is explained to the moist basic explanation.  Dr. Stone is more profound than you might think at first glance. The you ask yourself: Where will we be without STEM? The Stone Age is the quickest and most simplistic answer.",5
dr-stone,Dr.Stone Fuccccs with it! I hope they find out what made then turn to stone but also my boi Senku (one of the main characters) making big moves. I would recommend this anime to my friends (If i had any) that don't even normally watch it. If you want to watch an anime that you can learn a couple things from this one is a good. It is not that hard to follow and is funny too. Every time they want to do something in becomes into a whole mission which I think it awesome I don't ever get bored of watching it.,4
dr-stone,this anime is very interesting and i really like the concept. but i'm not a big fan of girls with huge b00bs or slutty dresses. i don't know why it became a thing. i just can't take any work with huge b00bs serious. like the new one piece.                                                                                                                                                                                              00                                                                                                                                                       00,5
dr-stone,"I love the premise! In some ways, there is the Isekai feel of someone with knowledge of our 'modern' world that is transported into a world without any of that and has to build their way up again. However, these characters don't just have a time skip and suddenly have a trunk and gasoline. Every single process and item they need they have to get, and it's difficult! It's certainly not easy to make all this from scratch and I love how Dr. Stone shows that. Senku is a brilliant man and it shows. The sheer dedication to count every second for that long, just to know how long it has been? The ability to retain all of the knowledge he gained? Insane, and I love it.",5
dr-stone,"I really, really like the show for what it is. Important part of that sentence ""for what it is""In a lot of ways, it's Jojo on a date with Science or, for my older readers, an anime homage isekai of Pinky and the Brain. Remember this is a SHOW, not an educational documentary or something of that sort. Dr. Stone is somewhat of a reverse Isekai, where instead of going to a new world, it's the same world, gone backwards. Humanity is pretty much dead and the world is returned to it's roots like something from the game The Last of Us. It follows the story (after 3 or so episodes) if a BLATANT gary stu (senku) who somehow knows 2,000,000 years worth of knowledge and I'm convinced he stores it somewhere in his hair trying to return civilization to what it used to be and solve the overlying mystery of why everyone turned to stone in the first place. The show is GOOD, it's very entertaining, if you can just watch it as a show. This is by no means accurate science, it can't be- it has to stay entertaining, and there's constant back and forthing between a legitimate show and what I can only describe is over-dramatic Jojo antics. A teenager literally takes down a lion with his bare hands, naked, and then they give us a series of glory shots before he starts going full plot hole villain on us.  Senku, as much as I'm amused with his character, is literally insanely broken. There's no way even a genius would remember that much, especially after being frozen in stone for thousands of years- sensory deprivation can literally cause a person to go insane after a few days. Everyone else is literally stupid compared to Senku, even in the modern world (You're pinky and he's the brain). So no, the science isn't 100%, but that doesn't mean it's not fun. The show is just that: Fun. It's dramatic, it's silly, and it's ultimate pretty funny at times. (I'm wiling to sacrifice EVERYTHING for a SODA- Gen is my favorite character for a reason). To be blunt, I'm glad to see there's no horribly crammed in romances- Senku's only love is SCIENCE.  The art style varies for me, I love how the men are drawn but the weird doe eyed way they drew the girls and the BLATANT homages of ecchi culture are just... sigh. The girls deserved a bit better (common in anime), but the rest of the world is beautiful. If you want to watch Dr. Stone as an analytical person expecting to learn something: Don't. You probably won't enjoy it due to the inaccuracies. If you want to watch a somewhat silly, science THEMED show that's entertaining: go ahead and watch it!I am going to keep watching Dr. Stone for the entertainment aspect- it's not supposed to be educational and shouldn't be unfairly judged as such. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars from me is the way the girls are drawn. Seriously- why are their eyes that far apart. It bothers me. Over ecchi-ifying the normal interactions also lost that 1 star for me (Episode 15, I'm looking at you).",4.5
dr-stone,"this is an original and entertaining showThis might honestly be my favorite anime as I'm writing a review while only being 6 episodes in as of me writing this review, however I rarely write reviews unless they're actually good or really bad. It's educational and unlike other fantasy worlds it has its own story and an actual smart protagonist. LIKE  A REAL INTELLECTUAL, not just one scene in which they're smart, but throughout the entire series at least(till the 6th episode since I've only watched that far when I wrote this review) If you like Code Geass or Isekai world animes, you're definitely going to like this one.",4.5
dr-stone,I first started watching when there were only a few episodes out; after seeing a tiny bit of lazy animation I went to go look at the manga to find that it is an artistic masterpiece- the manga is literally so well done that at first it made the anime look like hot doodoo; but with time the animation has held up and proven to be a match for the manga. The characters grow on you and it really does become an amazing show after only a few episodes. Give it a shot and stick with it and it will be ten billion percent worth it.,5
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"This is just my opinion on Boruto, and what I honestly think. I've heard people say that Boruto is worse than Naruto, both in quality and story-telling, but i'd like to think that's not the case. People are comparing Baruto to Naruto, and of course it's not going to live up to Naruto's massive name. At least not yet. But I like to think of Boruto, not as a continuation of Naruto, but like a different anime entirely. It doesn't take a genius to see that Naruto is no longer the hero, it's Boruto. And people going on about how it's not as good, or Naruto is better, or let it die, that fine to think that way, but remember Naruto seems better because its more flushed out, it's actually a finished story, and because it's nostalgic. After all, this is a new chapter for the Naruto universe, but don't think of it as a sequel, or a forced follow up, think of it as it's own brand, and it's own story. So for i'm excited for the road ahead, and judging from the past of Naruto, this story will be finished by the time i'm in my mid-twenties.",3.5
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"If I was watching this for the first time without ever having watched Naruto, I'd probably have stopped after the 2nd episode.  The protagonist, Boruto, is a young man with a very narrow view of the world.  This father is the leader of his village and a workaholic, he's angry at his dad for not being around more, but does little to nothing to actually support his mom and sister and instead is a trouble maker, acting out in a desperate cry for attention from his father, but if he got that attention, he'd reject it out of hand.  The kind of kid that has everything, but not what they want, and nothing will ever be good enough for.  Difficult for me to even like a character like this.Having actually followed Naruto form episode one though - there's a HUGE issue with this story from the word go.  Naruto ignoring his family.  It just doesn't work on so many levels it's ridiculous, regardless of how much the job of Hokage demanded of him, Naruto is not the type to leave the women he loves and his kids without a husband and father.  He's uniquely suited to be able to do the job of Hokage AND still have time for family al la Shadow Clones.  Even without that - he's just not the type to leave his own family on auto-pilot and hope everything turns out okay.I realize there is a social commentary going on here for a common occurrence in Japan, regarding absentee fathers that are so overloaded with work they are rarely ever home and the effects on the family, it just doesn't inspire the hope and heroism that the Naruto franchise has build it's amazing success on.",4
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"Do you love fillers?Do you love a dragged out meaningless story?Do you love a plot that gets nowhere?Do you love a story that seems to be getting to a turning point but you realize it is not, and it is just another side quest that ends up being a total waste of time and all bs that serves no main purpose to the overall storyline?You love this anime then. Boruto like naruto is an anime filled with fillers and bs storylines that take like 20-30 episodes to reach and ultimatum that could have easily been reached in 3 episodes.So far everything up to the current episode besides the chunin exam and events that followed after have been meaningless. That being said you can skip over all the other 60 some episodes and miss nothing relevant that entails any major events in this series overarching storyline. Thank you Boruto. This anime has been nothing but a bore and I continue to watch it angrily for the mere fact I liked naruto. Although I did not watch naruto as it was produced because I am sure I would have hated it too. I skipped all the filler garbage.If you plan on watching this garbage I recommend looking for a post that tells you what episodes matter and what episodes do not, like with naruto, so you do not waste your time. I believe a good 5-6 episodes is cho chos love interest, fucking waste, and then a good 20-30 episodes is the crew looking for dogs and doing random quests in the city. More of a fucking waste. My advice would be to watch the first 5 or so episodes to see the gist, skip everything, including the one girl with the beast inside her, because ultimately that had nothing to do with anything. Watch the chunin exams and the following events, similar to the movie and then after that nothing relevant is occurring. So like 20 episodes of total relevant storyline.You are welcome!",3
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"The first episode was fine but it quickly went downhill from there.Boruto suffers some major flaws, which might've been less noticeable if the Naruto universe was fresh, but since it's not...Characters are too similar to their parents. Boruto is bo-ring.The plot/conflict has no drive. They open the series with some future BS promising a huge conflict and greatness instead of hooking us with likable characters in a new/interesting setting.Naruto as a Hokage and father is... disappointing.Children aren't clones of their parents. And since we already had 500 episodes of the standard shonen hero, I'm not about to watch a clone.",1
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"after seeing 95 episodes i can finally say that this anime is meaningless. It lacks story, it's childish, boring, it has tons of bad fillers. The only thing that keeps me watching this anime, is because the old iconic characters from Naruto, such as Naruto, Sasuke, Rock Lee, Kakashi, Orochimaru and so on. The fights are extremely short ones, not even a single fight lasted more than 2 or 3 episodes.  It gave me the sensation that this anime is a lowcost one. 90% of the people watching Boruto, are Naturo veterans, i mean, at least +18 years old, but Boruto targeted 11 years old audience. It's really disappointing for me, because i was the one who defended this anime from the beginning, saying that it would get better. But after 95 episodes, it can't. (I won't cease watching Boruto, i have a little hope to hang on)",1
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"let's start positiveThe hook at the start is genuinely interesting.  The animation and art style are much better than i anticipated.  I was worried they'd continue with the dated animation of shippuden (no hate, but it started almost 10 years ago).And now to anger the fanboys (god forbid we look at a show objectively)They spend literally no time characterizing anybody.  We get some brief clips that basically say, hey he's a troublemaker and his friend is more levelheaded.  After that, it's him being a small-town hero.Most shows have so much more to critique.  but, that's the show.  Watch Boruto get into some mischief, and then do something heroic to resolve something absurd.  that's been every episode so far.  There isn't even any real actionI was really interested to see this.  generational arcs for shows can be really cool, and Naruto has some really deep lore to it.  unfortunately this had the depth and writing of a children's cartoon.",2
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"So I know Boruto is completely different compared to Naruto, and Yes I get that is suppose to be a good thing, but When you do the anime wrong and Make the characters bad compared to their parents then it's just a sad excuse for an anime. Boruto is suppose to be this prodigy child where he has the skill and power to become a top tier Ninja, but His emotions get in the way of everything and He acts like he is entitled to most things, and Has daddy issues beyond belief. Not to mention their missions aren't interesting and Seem Elementary compared to the missions Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura went on with Kakashi sensei. I'm sorry, but This is a fail of a classic Shonen. I rate this anime a 2 out of 5 *'s",2
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"The pace of the anime is good but so far it is a copycat of Naruto, the children have the same personality and ninjutsu as their parent so it's not very refreshing...The most annoying thing is that Naruto as a dad/member of the family sucks. I don't really like the fact that for a kid that grew up without parents it actually does the same to his kids and he doesn't really fit Naruto's personality. Quite a shame that Boruto hates his dad!",2
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"I wanted to like this series so much because I missed Naruto.What they made is a show where adult naruto becomes a salaryman and has a kid who is a spoiled brat who hangs out with his friends and causes (a little) trouble. Every episode is the same, nothing happens to the story because they want all the action to happen in the movie theatre episodes.Basically, they are using Naruto and trying to extra commercialise it but without making a product you even care about.What a waste or of great intellectual property. I will stop watching it until I hear they sort out every episode being a filler.",2
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"Now before you tell me the reason I dislike Boruto is because I'm just a hater, I want to explain that I wanted Boruto to be a return to form. Original Naruto was great and I was hoping to relieve that but Boruto is a different series. The reason I dislike Boruto is because it too similar to shippuden Naruto. Eye powers are the only powers that matter and are spammed, the plot is filler and never moves forward, and the battles are somehow worse than shippuden. There all about who can make the bigger explosion yet there not as a flashy and this show dosen't have the gotcha moments of original Naruto. Its bland. I never liked the war arc and this show just feels like a extension of that. I honestly don't care about Boruto being a brat, Naruto's entire character was that. But it's the fact that he insults the character I have followed since I was seven. Overall, I feel like everyone hates on this show for the wrong reason. What we wanted was original naruto but what we got was the war arc with Kaguya ripoffs appearing every now and then.",3
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"IF you have seriously been with Naruto from the beginning. Then either stop or don't watch this series. It feels forced. From the final moments of Naruto, i would have expected this whole series to be an illusion I mean let's face it, Naruto should have stopped after the final arc. It was very very needless to continue to BORUTO. We fans who waited each week for each episode have always felt an odd change in the near ending of NARUTO. BORUTO shouldn't have ever come to existence. It's a humiliation to the NARUTO series. PLUS we all expected/wanted a NARUSAKU canon. I mean i hate Hinata, but forget the canons, this series is far worse than the canons in NARUTO. The development of all the characters were going so well, until the NARUTO:LAST and the ending of NARUTO. It changed too much for ones liking, the transitions was anything but good or smooth. Moreover, Boruto character is the worst i have ever seen.This is a series i will happily erase from my memory. I will always remember the NARUTO we grew up with. I wish for NaruSaku Happiness.",3.5
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"I just finished watching Naruto & Naruto Shippuden so I decided to go watch this to see if they could take the story to new heights...They didn't. The first episode was okay but as you watch you realize how flawed Boruto is a a person. His entire thing is 'I have daddy issues and I really want to spend more time with him but I'm also a piece of garbage who can't realize how great his father actually is.'. Look Boruto, I get it. You want to spend time with your pops, but don't act like… like… like… a brat. You want people to recognize your strength, but you push everyone around you away with your annoying behaviour and hints of narcissism. Also, Naruto would definitely be a better father. He grew up without a family and, yes, he did have a few father figures here and there but for most of his life, he was without. Knowing this, it's obvious that he would have flaws as a father but this? No. He would be able to understand, to some extent at least, the importance of someone acknowledging you. Someone being there for you. But in the show, he just doesn't. Sure you can be proud of someone but if you never tell them, or if you're never around, how are they supposed to know that you care? Last thing. Be creative with your names. FOR GODS SAKE! If you don't want fans to compare the two, one - don't make their names the same, two - maybe expand on OTHER villages. Like, a different series didn't have to be in the hidden leaf. It could've been done in a lesser known village or a completely new place within the Naruto universe. Three - Don't name the show, 'Next Generations'. That's telling people that it WILL be a continuation of the show you love so much.All in all, just don't watch it, nothing will change, you can live without it. Don't even watch it for the original characters because most of them aren't even there most of the time.",3.5
boruto-naruto-next-generations,Please stop spoiling the name of the anime with your foolish storyline and fillers. It lacks coherence in some places. For example when boruto went to save mitsuki he and the old man caught in a place where they cant get out without a heart stone and we were wondering what it would be about. But they got out without the stone and did not even what was the whole heartstone was about.The fillers are nonse. If you dont have a proper interesting story atleast ask the fans. I hope they have a better one. Make it interesting. Day by day we are getting lost of our interests. No proper fights or twists to make it interesting. Please as a fan like to make this anime better. Dont make it worse.,1
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"Naruto is my favorite series of all time. This does not compare, and honestly that's very disappointing because I had high hopes for it. Most of this feels like a child's cartoon and does not feel like the OG Naruto or Naruto Shippuden. I will say, however, this anime has AMAZING potential. If you watch the revised Chunin exam fight between Naruto and Sasuke VS Momoshiki, you will see just how amazing this show COULD be. I will return to this anime once the story picks up and I hope I will enjoy it in the future. But for now, I will wait and watch something else.",1
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"Discounting nostalgia, since I watched both series when I was much older, and enjoying it for what this is, fans of the original  Naruto, I have a caveat. If you like Naruto Uzumaki as a character, a hero you have seen go from hyperactive loudmouth half pint, who only desires to be Hokage to earn approval and affection, to a genuinely caring, selfless, and mature individual worthy of this position, turn back.I will try to avoid spoiling the original series, but my problem is as followed. Naruto Uzumaki is a borderline workaholic, and thus an absent father, in his son's Boruto's life. Given what we know of Naruto's own tragic backstory, this just angers me. They turn this careless, selfless hero into a neglectful father, despite the sad childhood he endured that by all means, would have made Naruto try to be a father.Incoming arguments I see.Naruto is busy keeping the peace? He's only stamping letters day after day, to the detriment of his relation of his own son, even missing the kids birthday. Even then, it has been mentioned that the entire world is experiencing a period of unprecedented peace. Given the whole breaking cycle of hate Naruto strived to do in Shippuden, and what we see afterwards, seems like he accomplished it well enough. Hell, Tenten cannot even sell weapons due to the lack of conflict.He considers the whole village his family. A bit more legitimate, but I don't honestly think that Naruto wouldn't eschew stamping papers to be there for his son. It completely goes against his character for him to not value his family over paperwork.Yes, this is the entire reason why I choose to give this series One Star. I think many things improved, but having a bratty protagonist is one thing, tarnishing the legacy of a rather decent protagonist is another.This is extremely noticeable as it goes against his very character.There's no reason for this. Have Boruto be tired of being referenced only as his father's son, and perpetually be in his shadow. Have Naruto hold high expectations that Boruto may be stifled against, anything.",1
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"Although this anime may be okay on it its own, it is important to recognize it is a continuation of Naruto and it seems very out of place and only seems to be dragging on. Besides the first scene in the first episode (the future), I had some hope that the show would pick up (I know it's still a little early to judge) but all I've seen thus far is an uninteresting plot that maybe would pull little kids heart strings, That being said, I have personally felt more negativity from this show than feelings of pleasure from things being done correctly(from a point of view of a long time fan).",1
boruto-naruto-next-generations,Don't watch it. Just don't. Read the manga instead.The studio has completely ruined the story and turned it into a slice of life with no story progression nor character developement.All i can say is if you don't like the first 2 to 3 episodes then you're not gonna like the rest. Cause it only goes downhill from there with a few sparks of hope that get stomped out instantly by more monotonous slice of life garbage.,1
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"the manga actually kicks ass, but the anime has stunk since the invasion plot wrapped up.don't watch until they adapt the manga",1
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"How is it that the creators of Naruto can let such a huge disappointment carry on? The way this series is progressing seems as if one can already tell how they are either trying to let time pass for the manga to get further ahead before starting, or the creators are just doing what they want since it's a new series. Either way, IT'S ALL MAKING BORUTO AN OVERRATED ANIME NOW! At least in Naruto, they made canon episodes and just threw in fillers here and there. They didn't make 99% of that series fillers like how it's looking for Boruto. At this point, I'll just wait for the DVD release when I know I can buy the relevant seasons that are actually canon.",2
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"It is understandable that Boruto is growing up in a peaceful era, therefore, there is basically no problem. That is the problem of this anime. It would have been better to continue Naruto's young adult/older teens era because it would explain how the village became a modern day city. The violence in the anime is nonexistence. The good plots are too short; for example, the Naruto vs Momoshiki had an excellent fight scene, but it was too quick. It felt rushed and when the spotlight is directed to Naruto, it is quickly moved back to Boruto. It is simple in my opinion, Boruto just does not have the environmental problems that Naruto has to become a good anime. And even when a problem does come out, it feels as if it came out of nowhere. It needs to be mysterious and hyped up like the Akatsuki. They were antagonists that were slowly being revealed and also had their own original personality. However, in Boruto, everyone's personality is like a fake Gucci belt when compared to the Naruto characters. Shikadai is too much like Shikamaru. Mitsuki is bootleg Sai with a combination of Sasuke. Boruto, obviously a lot like Naruto, but wants to be a Sasuke so bad. It needs to be like the relationships in Naruto/ Naruto Shippuden. Asuma was the son of the third Hokage, but did not act like him. He had his own unique personality. This is what Boruto needs. The character development is like a copy and paste with a mix of other characters. It needs to be unique, but it is just not there. Conflict in this anime is too weak! Fillers and plot are all the same. I love Naruto and Naruto Shippuden, but Boruto is just a massive disappointment. Do not rush character development, because it has ruined Boruto so far. Despite that, I will continue watching the canon episodes, but for the people watching the first 100 episodes or so, expect disappointment to come.",1
boruto-naruto-next-generations,This anime pales in comparison to its predecessor. Naruto had good character development within the first couple of episodes that layed down the foundation for their great characters. However with Boruto it feels like your'e watching care free kids screw around with no real purpose. Also the amount of fillers is ridiculous. I know that the show has to do it to keep up with the manga but I'd rather have a break thank some half assed episodes. We're on episode 86 so far and non of the arcs have been good besides the Chuunin exams (Which was already made in movie form) and the very first arc. The pacing is incredibly slow and it makes me wish that the village could be fucking annihilate already so that these kids can gain some conviction and grow as characters.,1
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"Okay guys, let's be honest: ""Everyone has their OWN opinion."" - That being said, understand that not everyone is going to enjoy uncharted anime. Boruto is a spin-off the original Naruto series, but having a closed mind, defeats the purpose of watching it. - When you think about it, the original ""Naruto"" journey came to an end; much like most anime (such as dragonball, dragonball z, etc.) - Not comparing these 2 anime alike, just the time frame. >> Every story has a beginning and an end. >> I've been a Naruto fan since it first aired back in 2005 (America) and 13 years later, am I a bit biased...""Of course!"" But asking questions that only the developers of the series can answer, won't change anything. >>> I'll end with this, ""Watch the anime, Open-Minded,"" and just appreciate it. Much like anything else in life, ""You're not ready, Until it happens."" So decide for yourself, if this spin-off is for you and if not, just move on to the next anime. ~ Have a great day!! (｡◕‿◕｡)",1
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"So far I really want to say I would recommend it but I really can't at this state in the anime. This anime has such a huge potential to explore the other side of the world that Naruto is set in, but as it currently stands almost all of the episodes so far wouldn't have been missed. The reason for this is because they honestly just feel like they are there so the manga can get a headstart. That means that most of the episodes so far have felt lacking in writing and importance and that makes them very dull. I won't start getting into the characters since this anime is basically a follow-up to Naruto and Naruto Shippuden just for the ""younger fans"" and that's why most of the characters are blatant copy paste from the Naruto story (although their personalities differ in some of them).But I would definitely recommend to start watching when the anime starts with the ""main"" content of the manga, but as it stands right now it certainly is not more than 3 stars (The only reason it got 3 stars was because of the film arc which gave us one of the best made fights in perhaps the whole of Naruto), but of course that very well might change in the future.",3.5
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"The first 50ish episodes are actual garbage. Hands down the most boring thing to watch. BUT! They've finally started to get to the point of the movie and have altered the timeline from the movie, I hope I don't eat my words, but I can see this finally starting to become an anime worth watching. Currently, they're on episode 60 and I am starting to care and watch with actual interest. Lets give it another 5 episodes and see if they're going to give us an incredible show like Naruto or give us some seaseme street, watered down, trash.",3.5
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"I think this has something against the so called ""Yutori"" people in Japan. First of all, don't think that should be the main topic of a ""Ninja"" anime. Secondly, I don't think they fully understand what kids are really thinking because most of the problem the characters carry is solved by ""okay let's be friends"" or ""Hey, I'm a genius"" and Boruto and everybody else practically doesn't need to work for it when Naruto had to risk his life each time. Thirdly, there's no one who actually scolds Boruto for his actions like Iruka Sensei in Naruto. Lastly, I believe an anime becomes really cool because they have a strong belief instead of whining all the time or goes through obstacles which they actually have a hard time overcoming. King of the Pirates, Hokage, etc. The obstacle in this anime is all mental and not physical and seems like the age rating became PG. I guess now that Japan's PTA (Parent Teacher Association) could basically criticize everything that's not fit for their children, it became this way. Wasn't really expecting this from a battle main anime.",2
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideHonestly, i have heard a lot of bad stuff about Boruto and how it isn't going as fast and isn't having as intense battles as the series Naruto so far- and there is sorta of a reason why i feel like this is so. In Naruto the original series there was already battles among other lands and risk of war- it was basically always in the horizon- just look what Itachi saw as a kid. he saw hundreds of dead shinobis! It was a darker time back then. the first battle in the manga and series was of team 7 leading a man to his bridge he was building- but it then ended up that this man was actually targeted for death .Now look at the series Boruto.the end of a war already happened. the land is all in peace from our knoledge so far- so why would there be any huge battles? it makes sense that Boruto is having more of a calm childhood at this moment in time. If there was instantly a intense battle so early in this series (20 episodes and under) Then what did Naruto risk his life and his teams life for?! see my point? The battle with shin felt more like a filler to make it at least have some fighting aspects to it. But I feel like around the 60-70th episode they will start showing dark spots in the Boruto series and start killing off characters.. i feel like we just all have to wait until that exact time does come. that's why im rating it 5 stars.. i feel like there trying to put character development a little bit more forward and putting the ""happy"" times forward while they actually can. since again- remember. the war JUST ended, and the battle on the moon technically hasn't happened yet in the series- so. let me try to explain this the best way i can- Boruto wants his father to actually pay attention to his family. and he hates his father for it! now. if we go to the first part of Boruto and that small cut scene. he believed in the way of the shinobi and he was willing to risk his life for his father once again- so there has to be some sort of ""trigger"" to change Boruto like that. (maybe he just matured, or even a huge battle changed him?) We just all have to wait for the right time i guess. but when that time comes- I feel like Boruto will actually be known as a good anime. if someone actually reads this, im so sorry you had to witness my rant xD",1
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"So I should preface this by saying that I'm not a huge Naruto fan. I enjoyed the series for what it was, but I was never quite head over heels for it. Boruto's cast of young students remind me of my own youth, and has more of a emotional pull at times. Not to insinuate that people couldn't relate to the original series. For me, the idea of having to grow out of the shadow that was your parents is something that hits home for me. Many of the cast are trying to deal with those very issues. Constantly being compared to members of your own family, and being reminded of your lineage. It made you feel small and uninspired, having the opposite of the desired effect. In fact, many of the issues these kids face are things I've seen many friends go through time and time again. It's what makes their struggles, triumphs, and failures speak to me. If I had to give any criticism, it's that the comedy can fall pretty flat for me, I feel like the comedy characters aren't portrayed as they could/should be, and they tease too hard about Boruto's potential power. It's a long wait between now and Baruto Shippuden, so it's ever slightly so annoying to see that. Besides that, I enjoy the show quite a bit. Can't guarantee all Naruto or any viewer will have the same experience I do, but it's worth checking out.",1
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"When I first saw it I was like oh god, but then as it went on it got way better. For those saying that Boruto is way worse than Naruto, think about this...-Naruto has been around for a long time and has obviously a huge following (so naturally when it ended people wanted to see more of Naruto not Boruto)-Nostalgia is a huge factor because many people watched Naruto when they were kids. It's hard to let go of something you loved as a child.",1
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"Naruto was what got me into anime and its great to see him still going strong after all these years. By the way for people talking about filler, you are wrong. The director for the anime tweeted a while ago that Kishimoto ( the creator of Naruto) is heavily involved in each episode and says ""expand on that"" ""I want more of this character"" So its just expanding on things the didn't have time for in the manga, which I think is great!",1
boruto-naruto-next-generations,First if you are expecting the same level of maturity in the story line as Shippuden than you might be disappointed. Likewise if you are expecting to see a lot of the OG cast as adults. However it is good show that is reminiscent of the tone of the Naruto series. The story is a slow build but the characters are interesting and the story line is decent and the running jokes are amusing. Overall it is worth a watch and is at least an improvement on some the god awful filler arcs they gave us in the Shippuden series lol!,2
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"Both for fans of the original Naruto show, and those looking for a place to start with the franchise Boruto offers a consistently excellent option. By making the struggle of legacy a central theme the show manages to thrive with Naruto's looming shadow, made rather literal in the first title sequence. By resetting the power scale, the world and the village are only in mild peril, with much of the conflict being returned to the characters. The action sequences are dynamic, well animated and varied, each of the characters fights in unique ways that can be appreciated on their own but add even more insight for those familiar with Naruto and Shippuden. An all around solid and highly enjoyable action show.",1
boruto-naruto-next-generations,The animations and the update to the leaf village in Boruto are stunning. There are so many colors and the buildings are huge. I believe that Boruto's sentiments toward his dad are a spit in the face to the generation that grew up watching Naruto and Shippuden. Boruto is very unlikable. I do agree that Naruto had that quality growing up but the circumstances are different. Boruto is an ungrateful kid with a strong family while Naruto had nothing.,2
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"Naruto always said ""Never give up"". That's what we need to do now, although the only good part of this show is the time travel arc so far.I believe that this show will eventually get better. If you didn't know, the manga of this show is actually good. Once the show gets to the parts with stuff like Kawaki and Jigen the show will make a come back. Hopefully when the anime catches up to all the juicy stuff it transforms from a 1/5 show to a good show.",1
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"I have watched Naruto for a long time. It is one of those shows that has earned its spot as a classic shonen jump anime. But Boruto,It had every chance to be more than it's predecessor let us start with the negatives and then move to the positive. Negatives1: Filler.The first 50 or so episodes are just a summary of a movie that was released about a year and a half ago, effectively making the entire first 50 ep's of this series filler. This doesn't include the countless episodes of filler on top of that. i would say that rougly 87% of this series, so far, is filler. 2: Uninteresting characters.Boruto has no ambition. plain and simple. he just wants to help his friends. which is normally not a bad thing. But each character in this series is either copied from Naruto, or has so little personality that it doesnt matter anyway. We have the carbon copy of Naruto, except that its a girl this time. We have Boruto. but he wants to be like Sasuke. This show as a whole is flawed to its core....and it feels like a cash grab. Please....just let Naruto, as a series, end. make a new story, with new characters. It breaks all of our hearts seeing the series milked the same way that dragon ball is...3: Story: I have followed the Naruto storyline since it was written. despite the filler arcs of Naruto, I managed to say completely interested in the storyline. Boruto has failed to keep my attention. so much so, that I am content with reading the ""spoiler free"" summary of each episode, instead of watching it. This story just isn't as interesting. far from it. PositivesAnimation: the animation, where it counts, is decent.Character backstory: somewhere in the sea of filler arc's and filler episodes, you will get some backstory to some of the characters in this show, this kind of helps you develop some sentiment with some of the characters, not all, but some of them. Naruto: Naruto is in this series, however limited, he is there. Which, I think, is the only thing keeping me watching/reading this series. Overall: 1 out of 5: This series is a cash grab. Everything about it is low effort, don't waste your time with this series like I did. Go watch One Piece instead",1
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"Unfortunately Boruto is, as I expected, a cash grab series. I heard from many that the manga is great but I'm just not interested in reading the manga. Without comparing it to Naruto, Boruto is just a bland anime with no sense of urgency or purpose in any of the arcs presented. I understand that the adaptation can not pass up the manga, so wait to drop the anime? Make it seasonal perhaps? There are too many great animes out right now and too many great animes that deserve more seasons for Boruto to ride on Naruto's reputation and then hope that it will be interesting after 600 episodes. Like another reviewer said, the content and delivery makes you feel like you are watching a cartoon for small children. Despite trying to develop multiple characters besides team 7, they just fall short on every character's development including team 7. Now after 112 episodes I've decided to tap out. If you want to put this show on as white noise, be my guest. If you want to enjoy a show with an actual purpose, this is not the show for you.",3.5
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"Let me first start by saying that I am a DIE-HARD Naruto fan. The series holds a lot of sentimental value for me and I always felt inspired and hopeful watching how team 7 overcame many challenges. There are a few things that I don't like about Boruto. For example, the new team seven is just the gene pool of the old team seven plus Mitsuki. By extension it also alludes the 3 legendary sannin of Tsunade, Jiraiya and Orochimaru. In Naruto, this inspired excitement as it felt like the successors of the 3 sannin were destined to team up together. However, in Boruto, it just feels lazy and uninspired. It feels more like they were placed together just because of their parents. Another thing I don't like is how Sasuke goes off on his own. I read previous reviews about everyone critiquing Naruto's Character development but the same can be said about Sasuke. Anyone that watched Naruto, will remember that Sasuke actually had a family, and it was only after they died that he became distant and aloof. Hence, having a family of his own, wouldn't he be present in their lives?? Lastly, I feel, in many ways, that Boruto is just a new-fashioned repeat of Naruto. Even the first official mission felt a bit like a rip-off. From the rank of the mission being higher than it should be to the saga of the bridge... All things considered, I think the series has potential and it's really not the end of the world. I like that Naruto has flaws as a bad parent, because this is more realistic. it speaks to how exhausting the job of the hokage is as well as the lack of parental love Naruto received as a child. I also think the next arc speaks to the fact that no matter how different we think we are from our parents, we tend to turn into them. The creators and developers also highlight the differences in ideologies between generations. What was once idealistic becomes wrappped up in 'red tape' and a new form of idealism is born. I think great things are coming in time, i just hope it's not a direct copy of Naruto.",3.5
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"This anime is functioning off the premise that unknown powers are looming from the Naruto series that will show its ugly head later on... but now that I'm on episode 100, I see there was little direction to that end - making Boruto look like a disorganized mess. There are too many missed parts of the story that are disjointed and will leave you thinking, ""How does this tie into the more developed plot from the beginning?"" You'd be right with that thinking 100 episodes in. Don't get me wrong, each episode (or prolonged interlude)is kind of enjoyable, but the character development and plot switching leaves you wanting... The goals of the main character are disjointed from the plotlines of the show, disjointed is a really nice word to describe this show now that I think about it. Think about it like this, How many episodes do you need to develop a good plot, develop good characters, and follow that plot until you end a good season? definitely not 100",2
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"Let's start with the positive stuff to get it out of the way in all honesty. 1) Boruto has some likeability to him, he's got great potential as child of Naruto and Hinata genetic lineage there's a huge potential for some crazy level ups and as a Naruto fan, you quickly see new but similar skills with their 2.0 version of the previous Main character from Naruto. 2) Not giving into the spoiler but I will say that the outlook combined with being a dumb fan with hopes I guess,  I'm still to this day interested in the actual real storyline of this anime main content.Those 2 things has the merit, in my book,  to get a genuine 2 starsLet the other side of this mess of a anime;It took me time to realize the production value of this show is catered to a proper 8 year olds audience. As a 30 something Man, I feel I'm kind hearted enough to like a more teen-driven anime and legit kid-stuff like Pokemon, is just a no for me. So if you're a big Corporation that milks on a success forever, it has a lot more chance to grow has a brand, if they start with a thing that was similar to the first 2-3 seasons of Naruto. (goofy but funny, I was younger, the Anime genre wasn't exactly what it is today either. I like it!)They want us to continue watching this without a care in the World about the quality of the show which here for some odd weird reason decided to go not 100% pure manga + filler content like Naruto. To touch on this point real quick; the pacing or the lack of pacing in this case is hurting the show. Which going out of the Manga storyline shouldn't have been. You either commit to go all out or semi-out like Walking Dead e.i. but looking at how quick 150 episode of Naruto then follow by 450+ episode of SHippuden. 20 years+ in 600 episodes-ish is not bad at all! we're at what year 5 with 100 episodes (i've personally watched) nothing happened yet.The progress shown from Boruto is consistently put in comparison with Naruto, from a storyline point of view, it keeps me captivated, I think about the glimpse of memories that flashes back from the previous Naruto and feel: ""this is a good moment, it's why I watch the show"". But then, that same moment is tainted by Chocho, the worst character of the whole serie. She is simply put annoying and brings nothing to the table; the worst filler- arc is hers for a long time until a later one get even worst but that's the point. The overall filler doesn't feel like there's some attempts. It's like there's complacency in being that name that doesn't have to fight to keep their place in the next Anime season. But it's because the content has ben dumbed down to the point of being watchable if my brain was 7-12 yo. I mean,past that age, I can't imagine a older teen being into Boruto. It's too dumb! It hurts me to watch it. It doesn't get better. Like other Reviewers you may have read before mine says; Yeah, it's true! the good part is at mid-50-60 episodes and it's in the movie, so it doesn't take long that all this god dang hope you accumulated from baring with it until then just....slowly vanishes until you write a review to explain why people should wait until the show is over.There's a bunch of Anime Youtuber reviewing Boruto with some similar title like: Boruto doesn't suck anymore as clickbait for me and you to watch and see if he/she can give you some hope that will make you take the hit and watch the whole damn thing because you're a ""completionist"" and you don't want to miss out on a small ""inside"" a stupid filler may have provide at some point....",1
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"Ah yes, a continuation of a beloved series following their children. Honestly, I think it would be more interesting if the Main character was Himawari. I got to Episode 80 and the TLDR of the series is ""How many times can we insert Chocho into this story?"" Seriously, there's more Chocho episodes than Sarada episodes. Sarada's even a really good character. AH, and 80 episodes in Boruto still hasn't grown as a character while all other characters have.",1
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"The best way to describe boruto is episode 136-220 of original naruto. Entertaining filler. Say what you want about naruto having so much filler, but it wasnt this bad!! Every arc after the chunin exams is basically pointless and leads you nowhere. I'm convinced that this show is a slice of life anime with decent action. There is nothing wrong with that but this show is basically a continuation of one of the most popular SHONEN anime of all time",5
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"As a pitch Boruto would sound like this,""Imagine a ninja world at peace, where all the children of our beloved Naruto characters live. The children all have potential to be great, but since the world is at peace the story has to explore the day to day monotony of being a ninja. As the children develop we'll have them face issues like terrorism, extraterrestrial invasion, and diplomacy issues. As for the main characters, we'll make them all really strong and smart, so their fight scenes can be like the later episodes of Naruto, before Shippuden. All the character's have their major tropes with flaws which viewers will relate to, but we'll never go too far into any one character's development, instead we'll world build with random plot points... etc...."" (This pitch probably was tangential, and spoke around points till it seemed like a good idea.)The key take away, -Boruto fails to maintain a steady pacing.-The arcs don't feel like a cohesive story.-The power level structure is different than the original series. -Plot devices are poorly used, and left unexplained.This series has the potential to become great if the writers created a story board for the overall series.",3
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"This whole series is honestly a giant storm of fillers to a story that has yet to be laid out. Some stories are somewhat alright but in no way, shape, or form help the story telling. There's probably been one arc that actually impacted the main story line in the 100 episodes that have came out, and that arc was in the beginning of boruto when he kills one of the gods. Other than that, the entire show is pointless. Me being the idiot i am, I keep watching it expecting it to get better... but it just doesnt",3
boruto-naruto-next-generations,Each time I think the story might progress in a meaningful way. The flame is stomped out and you have to try to rebuild that fire in hopes that it might become something great. Nothings truly happened after 100 episodes in my opinion. That or they could of easily made it 15 episodes or good content with an actual purpose and motive to get stronger to defeat some evil but all they do is a bit of interest here and there and then back to fillers. Oh well there's plenty of good anime out there. I'll just have to set this one aside. Hopefully just forget I ever gave it a good shot. 2 stars since I didn't totally hate it. Just disappointed in how it has gone.,1
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"To be honest, I was so hyped when boruto came out but it was just filler after filler. There was only one good episode which was the Naruto, Sasuke, and Boruto fighting together. The show is too moody, jealousy, and HEAVY friendship relationships. The character Boruto is not that good either. He doesn't have an apparent goal, he is to whiney, and the only thing that makes him special is that special eye of his. It's just a bad show for people who watched Naruto. This is my 3rd time watching naruto because there is not that many good anime and it's filled with action scenes. Even in some parts it makes shed a tear. It is that good! A boy who was unappreciated by the whole village because of the 9 tailed foxes inside him and he works his way to the top. Boruto is just a kid that is loved and appreciated by his family and friends and still complains that his dad is not there with his family. At least if the director made it where a big threat is threatening all the villages, and the kids are trained to fight and kill and learn the true meaning of life, that would be interesting",5
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"As a huge fan of the Naruto series, I had high hopes for Boruto. Severely disappointed, no cool abilities or anything remotely interesting to watch. It's the same moves/combo's time and time again with nothing new thrown in. Slight glimmer of hope early on when Boruto was marked by Momoshiki and nothing since. It's more like a young children's show based on showing just friendship and good vibes. Oh, and you thought Naruto had filler? Boruto says hold my beer...",4
boruto-naruto-next-generations,Honestly this show feels like a slice of life in the Naruto universe which is not a good thing at all. 113 episodes in (at the time of writing this) and only about 5-7 episodes were actually good enough to meet the requirement of being enjoyable. Every other episode feels like a chore to get through. It is really upsetting because there was so much potential in this show but after TWO YEARS since it's release nothing has happened in the plot at all with the exception that Boruto has stopped hating his dad so much after the first 50ish episodes.,5

boruto-naruto-next-generations,"This is filled with bad fillers. And the story doesn't match up at all. Right when I thought it would take me somewhere into the plot, it gets absolutely nowhere. The story is meaningless and the plots don't add up, it doesn't get anywhere. I give it a chance simply because many people were talking about it and I wanted to try to see if I'd actually enjoy the show, but of course, I did not. Boruto is similar to Naruto but worse in my opinion.",3.5
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"Going into detail would take a HUGE paragraph, so I'm just gonna say that - at least in comparison to Naruto - Boruto is a disappointment and almost an insult to fans of the franchise. The Anime is just a really bad try of japanese studios to get some more money out of the thing, the story is an effortless copy and the animations are decent at best. The whole Kara thing (don't even know if the anime is already there yet) is a poor man's Akatsuki and they didn't even try to implement some new or interesting characters. The new protagonists are literally their parents, with basically the same Jutsu and looks. Switching up the whole Hokage dream between Sarada and Boruto is nothing but a lazy switcheroo as well...Don't even get me started on the Manga, which I legit could not keep reading after they raped and changed so much about the original cast that me and my friends simply couldn't believe it. I highly recommend watching the original Series + Shippuuden, but please do the world of Anime a favour and do not watch or support this mess of a Shounen.",5
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"I had seen loads of bad reviews on Boruto, mainly about it being a copycat of Naruto or the fights being quite short, but after watching 99 episodes I can definitely say I will stick with this show 'til the end.I haven't watched Naruto before so I can't comment on whether it is a copy or not, but what I can say is that this show is really enjoyable and funny whilst also having some scenes that made me cry my eyes out. Most of the characters in this show have likeable personalities and there are a couple of great character building arcs. The art style in this show is amazing plus the fight scenes in this show are usually quite impressive. Some episodes of this show I have to admit are a little boring and I did skip pass a few, however, on the most part this show thoroughly surpassed my expectations and I definitely urge others to check it out.Overall I can't wait to see where Boruto will go and I know I will enjoy it.btw this the first review I have written so sorry if the layout isn't great or it's short. <3",5
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"I was so hyped when I heard that they were gonna continue the series. I was mind blown when i saw future Boruto and i honestly thought this might be a better anime than Naruto. I was wrong, this anime progresses way to sluggishly, the character designs are wack and do I even need to bring up the fact that they gave Sarada an Uchiha glasses. The only reason i gave this anime a three star was because of the intro in the first episode where we saw future Boruto and because i still believe they can fix this anime.",3
boruto-naruto-next-generations,This is like when a movie series keeps going even though it shouldn't and becomes a joke... Such a stupid idea and poorly executed show!  This show doesn't have any real charm or connect with good character development. I will leave out that it doesn't establish the originally characters development properly... Boruto as a anime should be stopped its not a good idea to keep going with!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,5
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"Really tried to give Boruto a chance but the only thing it has going for it is when the old characters show up. No good character development the only reason to care about characters is because of who their parents are. Instead of showing us some interesting character development and interesting plots we get some BS flash forward promising a ""great"" conflict and then maybe 1 good episode every 20-30 episodes. Don't waste your time rewatch naruto or shippuden or go watch something else entirely.",4
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"Honestly this whole anime is trash. They literally copied everything from the original anime. Same time frames, the kids are EXACTLY THE SAME, and same story lines. Just because the action and who they are fighting is different doesn't mean jack. Just like Naruto, you start taking the Test from Academy. Then fail Chunin exams where most of the finalists were the same kids. Then a ""FILLER SEASON"" of Naruto chasing Mitsuki. Sound familiar??? Each kid literally is a clone of their parents' jutsus, and even a clone of their PERSONALITIES. Don't say it's not, it literally is the same outline. On top of all, it is still STUFFED with fillers! The lack of effort in this anime is astounding. I did not want to watch Naruto 2.0. Terrible company, and anime. Have some pride, seriously.",5
boruto-naruto-next-generations,"In all manors of speaking Boruto isn't a bad anime, but just because it's not bad doesn't make it good.            My biggest complaint about this show is that episodes 48-66 are a complete copy paste of the movie and that is just absolutely disgusting. Anime by big companies may be known for filler but at least filler introduces some sort of entertainment whereas copying word for word, scene for scene, the Boruto movie is a notoriously new low.           Moving on from my hate, Boruto is slow progressing and this is mainly because they are duplicating the essence of Naruto's plot line where you start off with the kid version of the main character. A few years down the road, they will time skip, and everyone will be more powerful with more powerful enemies. My biggest question here ties into how I feel about DB Super, how do you top the creator of chakra as an enemy, what power can Boruto attain that surpasses the 9-tails+6-path sage powers in his dad? as far as I can tell this anime is doomed to failure as it will fall short in surpassing the mountains of progress made with Naruto.",5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"Ok, in all seriousness, Shokugeki no Soma is hands down the most genius work to come out of Weekly Shonen Jump in a long time! It's a cooking manga sure, but at it's core it's a battle manga. Think the anime version of Iron Chef with tons of food porn and people porn. No like seriously, there's a lot of ecchi and literal foodgasms happen. It's glorious, lol. And it even has an interesting and endearing feel good story to back it all up!15 year old Soma Yukihira (Yoshitsugu Matsuoka [Kirito from SAO]) dreams of becoming a master chef like his father Jouichiro (Rikiya Koyama [Emiya Kiritsugu from Fate/Zero]), but to do that he has to graduate from Tootsuki Academy, Japan's top culinary arts academy where less than 10% of the students graduate! He makes many friends along the way including young and timid Megumi Tadokoro (Minami Takahashi) as well as many rivals like the daughter of the academy's head Nakiri Erina (Risa Taneda [Yukina Himeragi from Strike the Blood]), all while trying to fight his way towards becoming the school's top chef via the grueling cooking battles known as Shokugeki! Can Soma make it to the top?With an interesting story and concept, likable characters, a fun mix of action and comedy with cute girls and a lot of tasty food, Food Wars! Shokugeki no Soma is a must see series!NOW WATCH IT!",5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"Warning:  This series has nudity, sexually suggestive behavior, and blatantly sexual cut-scenes that make it worthy of the title of food porn.  If Gourmet Girl Graffiti was too much for you, then you won't survive the first episode here.That aside, the concept of the show is actually looking very interesting.  The acting, script, and presentation have good flow with very well done dramatic music and style to highlight important scenes.  The food scenes are done in high quality style to highlight them as great co-stars of the show.  It will be fun to see exactly where they plan on taking this crazy train, since it has already gone off the tracks.  I am anticipating great laughs, and quite a few moments of embarrassment (oddly enough) from this series as it pushes against boundaries of both taste and social standards.The story centers on a young man just ending middle school with plans to study culinary arts in the small family restaurant with his father.  Unfortunately for him both life and his father have other plans, and he is forced to attend an ultra elite culinary school in order to find his path in life.  From the very start he is facing nearly impossible odds, and has to perform one food miracle after another in order to gain a foothold in this prestigious institution.  Once he gets himself settled in the dorms he finds that each of his fellow housemates are as unique as he is, and has already caught the eyes of the most elite students due to his brazen introduction at the entrance ceremony.  From there he will face numerous challenges and set backs in his new struggle of personal and professional growth.  One thing is certain, even in the face of defeat he is entertaining us with his best efforts.",5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"This is a great anime to watch! It's very true to the manga and the quality is great for the anime, top notch! Very great comedy and the way the animate and draw the reactions and food! I find myself eating every time I watch this show.....So be warned!!! If you're like me, don't binge watch this anime otherwise you'll find yourself eating ALL DAY! I feel like I gain a few pounds per episode- I can't help it since this show makes the cooking look so damn good!I recommend watching a sports anime after to counter the effects like Eyes Shield 21, or Hajime no Ippo to motivate you to work out afterwards.Great anime! You won't be bored or disappointed!",5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"This anime is truly amazing!!! I really love the story and the amount of action is in this anime. Of course I didn't have any expectations when I first started watching. I always thought this anime was going to bore me, but boy was I wrong. This anime did the exact opposite! This anime hooked me in and I can't stop watching and I'm seeking for the new episode almost everyday! I REALLY RECOMMEND THIS ANIME TO PEOPLE WHO LIKE ACTION, FUNNY ,AND FOOODDD!!",5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"This series is great so far, I have enjoyed the manga since I picked it up a couple months ago and this anime is doing it a great service. The animation is great and the characters are fun and interesting, unfortunately the story starts off with the fan service being rather heavy handed to hook people in and get them interested in the story and characters, it does become more tolerable as the series goes on but if you can't handle the first 3 episodes than it might be best to just move on. Still it is worth a look and if you can stomach the fan service you may be able to see just how great this story gets further down the road. Yes the foodgasms are a little too intense sometimes but it tones down for the most part later in the series, at least it did in the manga.",5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,The story revolves around Yukihira Soma a 15 year old boy who transfers into japans most elite cooking school. Just a heads up though if you really don't like ecchi anime this may not be for you. However you would be missing out as the charm of this show is both its intense cooking animation and its food-gasms This series is through the roof amazing from the quality of the animation to the outrageous-ness of the show I've never seen such well drawn food in an anime and I can't wait till later when it the intensity is high.,5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"As stated in the title the first two seasons were great, but with all things that start out at the top, they have no where to go but down.  In the first two seasons you get a lot of character development mixed with comedy and some seriousness. The latter half (so far) has been much of the same food scenes, nothing new really from the first couple seasons.  It just seems like they ran out of ideas.  Lots of ""oh whats this magical thin layer hidden within this otherwise normal food that drives it above perfection?!?""  They use this idea many, many times through out the entire series.  Once they hit the main story arc, its all Shokugeki's and no new development really.  The fan service throughout the series might be a little too much for me.  Literally anytime anyone eats anything they have a fantasy where they are mostly naked and making lots of sexual noises.  Even when someone tastes Soma's (the main protagonist) failed experiments (mostly involving squid tentacles), they ""feel like"" they are being assaulted by tentacles in sexual manners.  Overdone fan service just turns me off of some animes.  I feel like its the ""easy"" thing to do now a days to drive interest in adolescents.  The main story develops slowly throughout the first couple of seasons, which i could see why they drew it out so long, because its just mainly a meh story.  Bad guy wants to take over the school, recruits the top talent in said school to ""overthrow"" the people with imagination and make food that has no innovation in it and follows recipes to a T.  But I don't even get it because the top talent that the main antagonist has recruited are coming up with innovative recipes to serve during these Shokugekis.  You can tell they are ""innovative"" by the peanut galleries reactions when their dish is revealed.  Lots of ""OH MY GOD, HOW COULD THEY POSSIBLY ACHIEVE SUCH BALANCE IN THIS COURSE?!"" The Shokugeki scenes (especially in season 4) are quite boring to me and I find myself skipping through half of them to advance the plot.  This is probably due to the fact that I feel like I've seen the same development in every shokugeki through out the entire series.But with all its downsides its still something to watch and has its entertaining moments. That's why I give it 3 out of 5 stars.",5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"Growing up, I happily enjoyed watching cooking shows with my mother, as I played with toys in the living room floor. I liked watching her cook, and when I grew, I began joining in. I remember one Christmas, I received an Easy Bake Oven, an unusual toy for a boy, but I couldn't have been happier. Now, at 27, I pride myself on my own recipes and ability as a chef. When Shokugeki no Soma was announced for an anime adaptation, it  was [cleverly] marketed to be as ""Iron Chef: the Anime."" Intrigued, I picked up the manga immediately and fell in love by the end of Chapter One. The tight, snappy art style and character design struck me immediately and as I read, I adored each new character and savoured every challenge, every dish presented therein a delight to my eyes and imagination. The beauty of Shokugeki no Soma is that this isn't as advertised- it's not a simple set of battles in Kitchen Stadium. While the Shokugeki is an important part of the narrative, Shokugeki no Soma is a shounen. As you read on and/or continue to watch, you see Soma and Co. mature and grow, even right down to the length of their HAIR. You watch them struggle and learn and sharpen their skills while forming relationships and looking toward futures brighter than one can imagine. The story evolves, much like Soma's transforming furikake gohan served to Erina at the beginning of the story. Framed as a coming of age story with a premise of school life, the use of food battles known as Shokugeki spice up the story enough in between character interactions in a way that facilitates growth. Speaking of Spice, let's talk specifically about this adaptation, beginning with sound design. The ED of the first season, Spice by Tokyo Karankoron, is an absolute delight, with every ED and OP to follow adding something great to the energy of the show. The music found throughout the episodes is wonderful and dynamic, covering a range of motifs as broad as there are cuisines, from character themes to battle themes and beyond. The effects are also a delight, from bubbling pots to swift, snappy chops, the sound design is believable and appropriate. Visually, the show ranges from your standard faire of high school life and kitchen shenanigans to outright foodgasms using hyperbolic exaggerations of the taster's reaction to the main ingredients in a given dish. Let's not forget the main attraction- the show's about food, so the food in this looks absolutely amazing. Veggies look crisp, meat looks fleshy and fatty, and liquids look smooth and clear. The show has its moments where it looks slightly generic when focusing on just simple character action, but during the drama, which there is a lot of, and the action, which is also aplenty, the detail is kicked into overdrive and the show really comes into its own. The animation follows this principle to match the art quality. The characters are loveable and dynamic- noone gets left behind and every main and relevant side character experiences a range of emotions and experiences which goes a long way towards making them feel real.Altogether, Shokugeki no Soma is an array of tasty little morsels served up to you in a tight, neatly wrapped little bento that you can't help but be both satisfied by and ready for seconds after. 9/10, this faithful adaptation only suffers a one point loss for those moments in which the visual quality takes a backseat during lighter moments. It has become one of my three favourite modern anime and I cannot wait for it to catch up to the incredible manga, which by the way gets a complete 10/10 for me. OAGARIYO.",5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,This show. This show makes you hungry. ... And Wet. If you like PLOT and omelettes. This is the right show for you! On a more serious note. This show is very entertaining and promising throughout. Not a single episode left me bored yet each one had a nice cliffhanger to further intensify my  hunger for the next episode. Eh? Eh??? ... No? Alright. Bye! ZippNex.,5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"“Repeating trial and error and failing many times… it’s that process which makes the dishes shine.” – Soma YukihiraFood Wars! Shokugeki no Soma is a Japanese shounen manga series written by Yuuto Tsukuda and illustrated by Shun Saeki. Yuuki Marisaki also works as a person, providing the manga creator with the recipes. An anime adaptation by J.C. Staff aired between April 3 and September 25, 2015. Meet Souma, he is the son of the owner of a small eatery in Japan. For his age, Souma is a very talented person able to easily come up with new dishes; sometimes these dishes are some really weird combinations of the ingredients no one would ever use. After some time, the owner of the Souma’s eatery, Souma’s father, leaves the family business to work with his friend. Souma’s restaurant is on the verge of closing. To improve his cooking skills and to save the restaurant, Souma begins studying in Engetsu Teahouse Culinary Academy, which is regarded as Japan’s top culinary academy. The problem is that only a few are able to graduate from it, these few are world’s best gourmet of culinary. Will Souma manage to graduate from the academy? Well, this is difficult one to review. Food Wars is a very unusual anime that is worth watching for many reasons. It is interesting to watch, since it does a great job with tension. The main genre of the series, as I see it, is SoL. Yet, there are so many action scenes that you cannot believe that what you are watching is not an action series. In Engetsu Teahouse Culinary Academy, only the strong have the right to decide. So long story short, whenever you do not agree with something, you duel. No, they do not duel to death. Whenever a conflict might appear, the students have a culinary duel.  They cook some dishes and have judges assess their creation. And this is so cool. This might sound lame and boring, however, the creator of Food Wars managed to make these duels amazingly epic to watch. Animation wise, Food Wars has some amazing animation: from character designs, to amazing action scenes. Cooking has never been this epic. There are so many colors that you cannot close your mouth from amazement. Sound wise, Food Wars has an okay OST and some great Japanese voice acting. I highly recommend you to watch it subbed. The main protagonist of Food Wars is Yuukihira Souma. He is only fifteen, but he is already a highly talented individual, who just wants to take over the family’s business. To achieve that goal, he fights with the business woman in the region, where he lives, who wants to buy the restaurant. Souma’s father tells his son that only if he graduates from Totsuki can he succeed both in the business and in surpassing his old man. The problem is that only 10% actually graduate the academy. Anyways, aside from Souma, there are many other interesting characters to follow. What is more, even supporting characters are quite interesting. Enjoyment wise, this show is so enjoyable to watch that you cannot stop watching the series; you want more and more. There is an ecchi grain in it, but it is never unnecessary; it only shows how amazing the food is the foodgasms are real.Overall, it is a real gem. Warning: never watch Food Wars, when you are hungry, or you might regret it. Never before have I seen something even close to Food Wars. Great job Yuuto Tsukuda.10/10.",5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"This is one of those animes that I couldn't recommend more.The food is absolutely amazing and as a person who loves cooking I've tried a bunch of the recipes from the anime and they legit work. I am just impressed. It shows the passion for food, cooking and the grueling life of a chef. The manga writer wanted to make that point and I think the anime shows it damn well. If you aren't a fan of cooking I wouldn't be surprised if this turned you into one. Solely because of that I think anyone can enjoy this anime. There are more seasons after this one and oh boy are they all good.The character development is there along with the absolutely stunning art. I mean if you can draw and animate food that makes me loose my shit then you are doing a great job.",5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,Food wars ehmmm.. Anime about cooking that’s great for somobody who like food nor cooking. But when you watching anime about food plus that anime is eechi. That’s like eating very spicy chilli peper. Overall  for 1st season I never felt like there was something boring  .2nd season was mostly about yukihira changing but it was also wery good not boring.So come here and watch till the end.3rd season was so full of tension. I really enjoy it or more like to say savour it.I can’t wait to watch the 4th season. Clearly 5 stars,5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"Do you like the aesthetic of battle anime, but wish it were less violent and more slapstick? Do you abhor fighting and wish nothing but pure joy and ecstasy for all the characters involve? Do you love food and reminisce about the over the top reactions of older shows such as Yakitate Japan? Well then you have very specific taste and may want to broaden your horizons, but not today because today you're gonna be binge watching this anime all day long. You can worry about what to watch afterwards haha XD",5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"Food wars! made a great impression on me (anime only) when they had great visuals/animations with a satisfying soundtrack. The anime is definitely an ecchi anime that went a little too much foodgasms, but drastically toned down the foodgasms in episode 2. The series does an excellent job at making me want to come back because of how the episode ends. Food wars! overall is an interesting anime that manages to corporate food/cooking with humor to create probably one of the best spring 2015 anime. The show isn't for everyone, but if you manage to get past the first episode, I recommend that you stick with this anime.",5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"I've been waiting for this anime ever since I started reading the manga and it's a completely new genre for me. I love to cook but I've never been into reading about it. I like comedies but always shied away from comedy anime/manga. Well, Food Wars changed all of that for me!        I bought Food Wars as a digital manga for three bucks, thinking I would gift it to a friend. But then I downloaded it for myself and I've been hooked. Ever since, I've been scrounging the internet for the tiniest bit of information about the anime and here it is!        The cooking process is much more detailed than I thought it would be in terms of showing what's what and Soma describing his cooking secrets. It was action-y, which is what made me so interested in Food Wars! in the beginning.       Given the explicit nature of the manga with the foodgasms and such, I wasn't sure if they would be dialed down or turned up in the anime. I was wrong on both accounts; the foodgasms happen just as they did in the manga only animated with a bit of artistic twist. Soma is just as wonderful and is true to his character. I was a little afraid they would change him ^^;       Overall, I see the beginnings of a great anime from this first episode. And the ending was perfect: with just enough of a cliffhanger to make wish the second episode was already here!",3
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"Adaption-WiseJust a bit of background, the author/artist of this series was/still is a really popular Hentai Doujin artist before this series, and some of that carries over into this work. In the sense that the ecchi aspects of the scene do well to enhance the overall quality of the food reactions. The scenes are done greatly, and to hilarious effect as well where it's always fun to watch every unique reaction. The series animation keeps true to the original author's artwork, and the animation quality is top  notch as well. So far it's looking great as an adaption, and the choice of seiyuu is great. The Opening and Ending themes aren't that bad either, though lewdness might not be to everyone's taste.Story-Wise The Story of the first episode is great, and follows true to the manga while adding in their own subtleties. The first episode is great in the sense that it sets up Souma's character perfectly,  as well as getting you interested in his development. His temperament, his personality, his goal, and his bad ass moments are all wrapped up and shown in one episode. In conclusion this anime adaption is looking really great, and I look forward to where it's headed.",5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,ANIME LIKE NO OTHER. The characters? Are each captivating and unique in their own way. The animation? PERFECT. Down to the very detail. The soundtrack? PERFECT. The visualisation of global foods created? EPIC. I honestly adored this show from start to finish. All the challenges they faced and how they shaped each characters to further progress into their future was always captivating. I'm sad that I finished watching it now but I will always love this anime.,5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"Ok ima start with i love this anime and it's deffinetly on my top 3. so where to start well im not really a fan of etchi but it's not that bad in later seasons. so yhe it's an anime i didnt know i needed but cant live without. the main character is well balanced he is not to bragy but he isnt an cry baby. it's deffenitly an 5 star series and well the cooking is great i love to search up the recepies and try them myself, the anime has great character development i never though a show about cooking could be shonen and i didnt think i would enyoj it as much as i do. the animation is one of the best ones ive seen and i like how they managed to mearch the cgi with normal animation its flowing along like a river and dosent feal like out of place like many other animes feal when they do it. I REKOMEND IT FROM MY HEART",5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"I've been watching since season 1. In fact this show kept me subscribed to Crunchy when they hit a dry patch after the Funi split. The show is great because of season 1. To be honest whoever packaged that gift knew how to hook a viewer into a show. Most of the recipes are good, I haven't tried all, but they are mostly real recipes tried by real cooks. Later on they begin to improvise and there are some mistakes made; the show begins to drop the back curtain and you see the puppeteer. The writer isn't a cook or has ran out of ideas, so I wouldn't try recipes from season 3 and definitely not from season 4 unless your budget can handle you tossing prime seafood, especially if you're not an experienced cook you won't catch the errors and will ruin quality meat.Aside from that the show is really good, and asking for more than 50 high quality cooking tips from an anime is too much. So before you get angry I am criticizing the recipe in the show, please understand that I know it has overdelivered already! The action and story are pretty high octane in season 1 and 2, in fact there is so much going on, I would recommend rewatching season 1 so you can enjoy the food in more leisure without hectic reading of subtitles. Just my two cents there. Season 4 is a letdown. Not nearly as much story as 1, not nearly as much action as 2, gives one of the most antipathetic (unlikable) characters way too much screen time, and shows off the biggest hypocrite in a sympathetic way. I think the writers missed the mark with the guy and his mom, when you hear the backstory you'll know who I'm talking about in season 4. Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hide The bushido guy began discriminating based on upbringing and skills, after his mom was discriminated against for her gender. In my mind prejudice is prejudice, and you can't go around judging the quality of the finished product based on the technique of production.So season 4 is basically some fs and OK food so far ep6. But since these have been over 18 episode seasons, I think it can be salvaged. It's still OK though I am bored by the team shokugeki. I thought it will be more action since we are doing 6 entrées per battle instead of 2, but no, they simply split them up over more episodes so we're still getting one winner per episode. Some you get two but that's because the previous episode was a cliffhanger. That's another gripe with the show, cliffhangers, those got old when I was 8, a long time ago. I'm not exactly more fond of them now, they are a poor way to treat your viewer and insult the intelligence of the audience. If you have a good story to tell, your viewer will comeback anyway, no need for cheap tricks, and don't you think your audience is smart enough to see what you're doing with the cliffhangers? Cut it out!",5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"This show may seen weird at first and may think its a sexual one at that. But the more you watch you understand the love for food people have towards cooking and eating them. I love food and completely fell in love with this show and love everything about it. I love how much passion they have for cooking and tasting wonderful meals they created themselves. As well as, a learning experience. It is a MUST WATCH if you love food like I do!",5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"Food Wars is without a doubt one of the best shows on this site (and I've watched most shows on here). The art style is definitely nothing special at first glance, but the animation is extremely consistent and never lazy. The soundtrack is very memorable, featuring different themes for different characters. Food Wars is also pretty ecchi at times, but it is overdone to the extent that they just take the piss out of other, more serious ecchi anime. This goes to the point of making you laugh just at how ridiculous the scenes are, which is supported by the top notch VA. There are no other shows that manage to make me sit in my chair just giggling and grinning through entire episodes like this one does. Adding to this are well written dialogues with a lot of epic one liners that should normally just seem very try-hard but aren't for some reason. Characters in this show are also extremely memorable and rarely one-sided, giving most characters likeable traits and evolving them throughout the show.Overall, Food Wars will most likely blast all of your expectations to bits, which is especially impressive since shonen Anime is almost never truly good or consistently well produced. (Written shortly before the release of Fourth Plate)",5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,The premise isn't new but the execution is very well done has memorable characters and good pacing you really get drawn into the cooking battles and I enjoyed it a lot. My only real problem with this series is the gratuitous amount of unnecessary teaser fan-service and I'm one that usually doesn't care about that either way but this anime would have been just as good without it. I'm giving a low 5 on here and a 8.5 on a 10 scale. It has a really good English dub on Sentai's new anime channel Hidive check it out.,5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"Huh... where do i start? Food Wars is one of those unique anime titles that you've never seen before. It perfectly executes something new and refreshing, while keeping the plot interesting and fun to watch.STORY  It resolves around a student named Yukihira Soma, a teenager who enlists to the ""Tōtsuki Culinary Academy"" to follow his father's footsteps, while meeting new friends and learning new things about cooking. It keeps things interesting with it's ""Food Wars"" , which surprisingly keeps you at the edge of the seat.5/5 ANIMATION Simply superb. The food that you will be looking at in this Anime will make your stomach grumble violenty, so many times have i wanted to jump at the screen and taste the delicious things they were cooking!But this is where the bad part is, the facial animations. They become stale? boring? annoying? I don't know how to describe it. The first two seasons executed this perfectly, making you laugh at the funny moments, but seeing the same constant thing over and over again in Season 3 makes it really stale and uninteresting. Konosuba! does this perfectly, seeing different funny faces makes it refreshing and constantly funny, and it is one of the things i hope that Food Wars will improve on.I almost forgot to say about the ""clothes ripping"" after they try their food.It is also really hilarious the first two seasons, but it also quickly becomes repetitive and cringey over time.3/5 SOUND/MUSIC The music in this anime is really good. They make their Shokugeki's intense and suspenseful, constantly keeping you at the edge of your seat. Nothing much can be said around here.5/5 CONCLUSION As i said before, this anime is unique and something new in it's genre. It's one of the animes that i will gladly come back to if they make a new season (and let's be honest they probably will) and i really hope that they improve in their animation aspects.4/5",5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"I was honestly impressed with the flow of the story plot. When I first heard of this anime being a cooking show, I thought to myself, how long will this show last, but now I can't wait every week for a new episode. The story plot may seem like it may be slow for every episode, but it would make sense since making of anime and manga are on two different speed. And besides, I thoroughly enjoy the pace that it is moving at since it always leaves some kind of cliffhanger to the next episode. Greatly recommend this anime to anyone who has never seen anime, or want to start watching anime.",5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"It's badass cook offs -aka a ""Shokugeki""- are the best parts of the show. It's literally shounen inspired cook offs where you put getting expelled from the academy (or whatever of value you are willing, or not so willing, to lose) on the line if you lose. It'll get your mouth salivating, and I'm not just talking about the delicious looking food (*notices ecchi tag*) (͠≖ ͜ʖ͠≖)A solid 5/5 stars for me.",5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"WOW. Just wow. This adapted the manga wonderfully, and did not fail to impress me who's re-read every chapter of the manga. It's really ecchi, with good art, character development, and plot. I'll say a little more below.Art: No need to say, the art style is clean and good, and is probably the art style that I most enjoy.Characters: Some people who only watched the first few episodes say that it's boring how Souma always wins, but that's only the start. His character develops to be a lot more interesting than a fuckboy that always wins. Megumi, who had little confidence in the beginning, also begins to build up more confidence. Then there's Erina. She's on a whole different level.Each of the characters that the story focuses on all develope well, which I thought was really neat.Plot: The plot is just a freaking roller coaster of a ride. A good one for sure. There's never an episode that's boring because things are always happening. Spoiler Alert!

food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"This anime is much, much better than one would get from catching just glimpses of the show. I didn't watch season 1 until I had read a really compelling review in a magazine, and it lived up to hype.The animation and audio is top notch. Characters are very interesting, and you definitely are sucked into the ""action"". On top of all of that, you definitely get an appreciation for the food being made, and it is almost hard to not salivate over food, and to learn a thing or two about different forms of cuisine and they are prepared.",5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"At first the idea of a 'Food Anime' is a bit 'dull' as in the thought that it's originality or longevity would be at stake. Along with that of character development. But, I was wrong. Since Episode 1, Dish 1- I've been hooked and I show up every Tuesday to see the new Episodes. The First Season sets the parameter sand entices the viewer with foreshadowing and Character envelopment [Along with the Nice Food Porn]. Season Two hits the grand slam with the ramping excitement and trials the Yukihira endures. And Season three is where the challenging protagonist phase of realizing he is skilled, But he' not Number 1, yet. Meanwhile, they'll keep you enticed and the Ending of every episode leaves you wanting more...more...more. The Animation is fluid and nice. ALL Characters have Decent Backgrounds. And even some of the 'Enemies/Antagonists' are lovable too. I recommend 5/5 to watch this series.",5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"To preface this review, I will say that I have been watching anime since the early Dragon Ball days and have seen almost anything and everything considered mainstream/popular/hidden gems/unorthodox. And this show has managed to greatly impress me. It's obvious that a lot of love went in to making this series, from the music and animation quality, to the recipes that can be created in real life and the story being told. It is incredibly good.Starting of the first season gives you a sense of, ""what the hell am I watching"" but at the same time you cannot stop watching it at all. I marathoned all available episodes with each episode leaving me craving more. Yukihira Soma is a fantastic main character with his never quit attitude and intensity/passion toward cooking. I could sing this shows praises forever but I'll leave the review with this before diving into spoiler territory.Just watch it, seriously.",4
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"No issues with the former (other than consistently craving whatever they're cooking in each episode), but I tend to get fed up with over-the-top fan service. However I liked this show enough to overlook that. This is actually really good anime: good characters, storyline, etc. Most of the characters have their own specific cooking style and background story, and they grow in their own way as the story progresses. The main character is good but not OP by any means.",5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"Have you ever tasted something so good your clothes explode off of you and your left daydreaming in complete food-induced ecstasy completely naked? Probably sweating? This show is greatly satisfying, great visuals, great humor. Like, they are well aware how hilariously absurd the show can be. The show also inspires me to learn to cook and understand the theory of cooking more.  I want to go to culinary school now :PEdit - I also just noticed and am honestly very surprised to see there is even one 1-star review for this. I need to meet these people and observe them...",5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"Food Wars! at its heart is a story of failure.It's a story of failure as a crucial ingredient to success, even in the face of those who are incubated from it. It may be a cooking/battle shonen style work, but the story very much illustrates and eminates the whole spectrum of failure - from those like Soma who thrive off it, to those like Megumi who experience a turnaround from avoidance of failure to moving forward, to those like Erina who fear it more than anything.Failure is the spice of this world; addictive to those who savor the salvation beneath; Those who shy away from the pain never get to experience the pleasure that comes after.The plot is rich; the characters have layers upon layers; the motifs are dynamic, yet consistent in adding to the vibe of the show.Give it a taste.",5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"I have loved this anime since it first premiered! I have watched it an loved since day 1, despite not knowing if I would or not. At first the idea of an anime that is centered on food and cooking seemed interesting because I had never seen any other anime quite like it, but I didn't think it would be something I would love and wait in anticipation week after week!!! 3 seasons in and nothing has changed, it is and will remain among my top five favorite anime. Give it a try. It has a fascinating plot line that focuses on Soma Yukihira and his time at the Totsuki Culinary academy, where he meets friends, gains rivals and participates in the most epic (non-violent) battles in anime (this is culinary-shonen!) called Shokugeki. Join Soma-Kun and his pals at Totsuki as he claws his way up the elite. The Third plate: I love the introduction of the new characters, it gives an air of Soma getting closer and closer to the elite ten council. I love the first several episodes, but can't wait for more Shokugeki time! but this is really good time for Yukihira to appreciate a different form of competition cooking for the festival. It is also a good way for him to measure what he still needs to learn in order to enter the top ten council. He is still but a first year student. Also, I will never get tired of seeing Nishiki-senpai, lolol! If you have not seen this anime yet, or are debating to watch the third plate (who would do that after watching the first and second, but okay) don't wait or hesitate, the only bad part about it is the insufferable, seemingly interminable wait each week for the next episode to air!!! 5/5 rating since the first episode, it wont change!",5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"This show took the shounen genre to a realm nobody had ever previously imagined, and it does it in stunning fashion. For that, it deserves everyone's respect. Even if you don't enjoy this show(get your brain checked) you should respect it. It satisfies every kind of appetite you could possibly have all at once. The mundane became wondrous. Shokugeki, thank you for existing and inspiring the anime world. Season One, was a masterpiece in terms of script, plot, originality, characters, art, and audio. Season two picked up the pace of the show, developed the story sufficiently without wasting time.Season Three: This season expands the world of Totsuki and develops the main heroine more than anybody else. It is a shame that Erina's VA is sick, because a lot  of this arc focuses on her development. While her substitute is acceptable, she doesn't capture the original VA's haughty/dignified personality nearly as well. That being said, we can expect this show to satisfy our insatiable appetites for shounen, while making us crave the cuisine that will likely never grace our palates. While this show is airing, expect it to take the first seat in the ratings.",5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"The jokes are spot on, the animation is smooth, the story is pretty good, maybe nothing spectacularly original, but has its own quirks. The main protagonist is pretty cliche, but so are a lot of protagonists in anime. I like how each of the characters have their own cooking style and skill in a specific area instead of them just being good at everything. I'd recommend for anyone who wants a easy going anime with a few feels thrown in there.",5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"It strongly starts off with more emphasis on key components that grab an audience's attention (stripping for food), yet ends up quite the opposite.  The originator really KNEW their cooking.  There would have to be intensive cuisine experience and research into this anime, and there definitely was.  If you want to learn how to master cooking skills, you can get a lot of information out of this.  It also has very interesting comical characters.  Definitely a top rated anime.  The more I watch, the pickier I feel about ratings, but this one deserves its 5 star.",5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"I like to think of myself as someone not afraid to give a beloved anime a rating of 3 or 4  stars instead of 5 if I think it deserves it, but I just can't do that to Shokugeki here. The art is beautiful, the story and characters intriguing, and the cooking... oh, the cooking! What's not to love, right? (Besides, perhaps, the crude and somewhat ridiculous fan-service.)And always remember the cooking and the food. This show will make you so very, very hungry, so you should be careful regarding how much you watch it, if you don't want to get fat, that is.Soma and the rest of the characters are fun to watch, especially when they make really pretty food. The best moments of the show are probably either characters making fools out of themselves or, that's right, food. Whether or not you like fan-service or comedy or any of that, I think we can all agree that we like food, and therefore we should all just watch Shokugki no Soma.",5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"Shokugeki no Souma (Food Wars) is an anime about battles of cooking as the title suggests. This anime has gotten very popular in the few months it has been airing and it has also been received pretty well. But is it any good or is it just another one of those popular but dull anime, that I will discuss in this review.  Story - 8/10 You must have realized that the anime revolves around Soma Yukihira who wants to become a cook and surpass his father in cooking. Some stuff happens and Soma ends up in Totsuki Academy, which is the best cooking school in Japan. After reading the synopsis, you must have come to the conclusion that it isn't unique or special, but that doesn't make it bad. The story isn't anything even special but the other aspects of the show are so well done that it makes you feel that the story is better than it actually is.  Art and Animation - 9/10 The animation of the show, to be described in one word, is brilliant. While one can say that almost all anime that are released these days have really good animation, Shokugeki no Soma's animation is a level above most others. (while not being as good as something made by ufotable but its still very detailed and fluent). The best thing about Food Wars's art is the way they display food, it's really good. The art is consistent throughout the show and doesn't get bad at any moment. The openings and ending too are animated nicely. The designs of the characters are, for the most part, unique as well, with most characters having different designs. However, one can argue that Erina Nakiri(one of the female protagonists) looks pretty darn similar to Asuna Yuuki from SAO.  Sound - 9.5/10 The first opening is amazing; it a treat to the ears. It's just really beautiful. I cant speak Japanese so I don't read the lyrics but just listening to the opening psyches you up for the episode. The ending is really good too but it still pales in comparison to the opening. (Says how excellent the opening song is). The second opening is good, but it's more of an opening for a fighting anime. The first opening was very charming and pleasant, which suits the theme of Shokugeki no Soma. However, the second OP's tone didn't quite suit it, in my opinion. It can be still considered good, nonetheless. The second ending is very good to hear too. (And they used the first OP at the end of the final episode 24 of the anime so that means it was the best of the series) Now, on to the soundtrack, in my opinion, there lack a couple of battle soundtracks which they could use during shokugekis and stuff. There is only one track which played over and over again, during food battles or while the characters are cooking something for their tests among other stuff. The track named Shokugeki no Soma Epic soundtrack(so much for a good title) on its own is thrilling to hear and you won't probably notice how repetitive it is unless you are watching like 8-9 episodes at once. But if you do watch around 8 episodes at once, there is a chance that you will come to complaint about the limited tracks. The limited amount of soundtrack is my only critic I could have in the sound department. The voice acting is funny when required, serious and tension-building during a shokugeki, which is also another plus to the anime. Simply put, the voice acting is flawless. Characters - 9/10 The cast in this anime is pretty big, which you would expect from a shounen anime like this. There are rivals, friends, upperclassmen, etc but they have gotten pretty good screentime to express their characters. Our lovely protagonist, Soma Yukihira is just really awesome. He can be OP sometimes with his dishes but he is awesome, nonetheless. He is and is not your typical shounen protagonist. When I say he is your typical shounen protag, I look into the fact that he has a goal of surpassing someone, he is pretty determined to do that, etc. When I say he isn't, the unique features of his characters come out : his confidence, he is good at what he does, he is arrogant. Now, here his arrogance does a great job because it's really fun to see the opponent's reactions after they are brought down by his words, and most importantly, he entertains us. For an anime like Food Wars, he is the perfect protagonist. The two main female characters of the show are damn good : Megumi Tadokoro is your usual clumsy, scared girl from a small village who hopes of making it big here. While there is nothing much unique about her character as of yet, she has done her job well so far and is getting development and she does get braver as the anime progresses. Erina Nakiri is the tsundere who is also known as ""God Tongue"" because of her ability to only acknowledge the best of foods. She is the daughter of the Director(or something big shot of Totsuki at least.) and her family is one of leads in culinary restaurants and other stuff in the world. She is prideful, arrogant and would destroy anything that could stand in her way of being no. 1 in Totsuki; anyone other than Soma. Erina hates Soma and you'll know why she does after watching the first couple of episodes. The interactions between Soma and Erina are fun to watch, really fun to watch. Although, the show hasn't focused on Erina too much as of yet, but I am sure she will be getting her time in this second half. The remaining characters, too, as I said, are entertaining to watch. Some of their interactions are hilarious while some will show you the intensity of the battles happening in Food Wars. Pros : 1. Extremely entertaining. 2. Amazing comedy and you'll jump out of your seat while watching some of them.  3. Great animation and soundtrack. 4. Immensely amusing character interactions. Cons : Comedy can get out of hand sometimes with the ecchi. If you aren't a fan of ecchi, you might not like the characters' reactions after they eat the food. They get naked and act and act like they're having orgasms. A lot of people have enjoyed this but some might not. However, the good thing is that these get less and less as the anime progresses and by around episode 8, these foodgasms are reduced since the anime starts to get more serious and take off to the skies. Enjoyment : 10/10 This anime is a hell of a ride and the entertainment value of the show is right up there. The first episode is nothing compared to what the next few episodes bring to you. The thing got better and better with each passing episode.  Overall - 9.5/10  In my opinion, Shokugeki no Soma is the best anime released in the year 2015. I guess, the stats it has on MAL speaks for itself. I would definitely recommend this anime to you, even if you are not a fan of such anime, it's worth your time and I am almost certain that you won't regret watching it.",5

food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"Food Wars!, or Shokugeki no Soma is a Japanese shounen manga series, which was written by Yuuto Tsukuda and illustrated by Shun Saeki. Due to big success, the manga received an anime adaptation by J.C.Staff, which aired between April 3, 2015 and September 25, 2015 and a second season, which began airing on July 2, 2016. The anime tells the story of a boy named Souma Yukihira, who has a dream to become an owner of his father's restaurant and to surpass his father as a chef. However, when Souma graduates from middle school, his father, Jouichirou Yukihira, gets a new job abroad and closes his and Souma’s restaurant. Souma cannot accept the fact that his father chooses a new work and tries to persuade his father to stay. But Souma’s father has a task for his son: Souma should become a student of Toutsuki Saryou Ryouri Gakuen and to learn to be a top-class chef. Everything seems to be easy, but after some time Souma finds out that Toutsuki is one of the most prestigious educational establishment in Japan, where only 10% of the students manage to graduate. Strange as it may seem, Souma is not afraid of his father’s challenge and he immediately decides to become a top student it Toutsuki. Will Souma surpass his father and become a pro in cookery? Find out the answer now!While the plot of this series sounds average, I want to assure you that this anime has many things to offer. Souma is just a normal young man, who does not have “money to buy everything he wants.” But his father makes him join an educational establishment that was built by the rich for the rich: almost every student of Toutsuki has a bodyguard and enough influence to do whatever they want. Funny thing is that in Toutsuki your background does not mean anything, you can be rich, you can be poor, it does not matter. You must, however, be a splendid chef. And Souma will have to fight against these monsters with millions, or even billions of dollars on their bank accounts to prove that he is better. And the most important thing about that is that Souma does not only win, sometimes he is defeated; however, his desire to become better, his desire to fight, makes the story-line truly interesting.The animation and sounds are also on the level. Not only character designs, but also the food makes you want to cook something delicious. The creators of Food Wars! spend enough time and money on the animation, making cooking look more like a fistfight than anything else. The sounds and the voice acting; however, deserve a special mention. The OST is so awesome that it helps you to dive into the atmosphere of this series and to be more prepared for what is about to happen. Truth be told, I have never called a shounen “epic”, but thanks to the OST of Food Wars! I can say that this anime is truly epic sometimes. But the OST is not the only thing that I should mention, the voice acting is also amazing: all characters seem to be real, their emotions, their deeds; the Japanese cast did one hell of a job voicing their characters.I cannot say that the characters of Food Wars! are absolutely flawless and I cannot say that Souma, the main protagonist of the series, is just an imitation of his ancestors from other shounen series. Souma is not perfect, sometimes you just do not want him to repeat all these cliché of his ancestors. (Not noticing that some girls love him, for example). But, at the same time, Souma is different because he is the true warrior, he is the true man. His aim to become the top, his aim to become the best. His is not a prodigy, he is not a billionaire, he is just a normal young man with his own dreams. Sometimes he is defeated, sometimes he does not know what to do, but he works hard and achieves what he wants. And I must say that his charisma is truly contagious. However, the main problem of this anime is supporting characters. They are so dull and boring that sometimes you just want to skip their scenes. Of course, I am not going to say that they all are bad, some of them are very interesting to follow. But I guess that more attention should have been spent on the supporting characters. I am glad that I discovered Food Wars! I could have never imagined that Souma would be that good. There will surely be some moments, when you are unsure if you should watch it, or not. Take for example “these foodgasms.” But, come on, it should not be the reason for you to not watch this series. In my opinion, the way they portrayed the way characters enjoy food is not that bad. I mean, delicious food is able to drive you to orgasm and if you do not agree with me, I am sorry to say that, but you have never tasted something truly delicious. All in all, Food Wars! is an anime I would surely recommend to all my friends and if I were you, I would do the same. Souma’s desire to become the best and his character are truly fascinating. He is not afraid to practice, he is not afraid to be wrong, he spends a ton of time to surprise everyone. And he is able to amaze not only his friends and enemies, but also the viewer. Anyways, to make long story short, I would recommend you to give this anime a try. But please, if you want to drop this series, watch what will happen in the summer camp; it will become much more interesting from this point. But if it is still not enough for you, you can drop this anime after Souma’s summer camp.Anyways, I hope that you will enjoy Food Wars!",5
food-wars-shokugeki-no-soma,"Everytime I watch this at night, it's a must to get a snack or some food first (though my food is nothing compared to the stuff in food wars). It's very exhilarating whenever there is a shokugeki/food battle going on (involving Soma most of the time) and there IS romance in this, just not as much as regular romance anime since it mainly focuses on cooking. this also has a 80% chance to motivate you to cook but then 90% of the people that get motivated realize they can't (i'm one of those people).",5
welcome-to-demon-school-iruma-kun,"I've read the manga and watched the first episode and highly recommend this anime!The basic premise is that the titular character Iruma has had a crappy life being forced to work horrible jobs on behalf of his parents. They then sell him to a powerful demon, who then makes Iruma his grandson, sending him to a demon school.The show involves misunderstandings, hilarious hijinks, and wholesome interactions between amusing characters, and unlike most material in its genre doesn't devolve into a bad harem over time. Studio Bandai Namco Pictures (Gintama) is handling the animation pretty well, with great music and direction.",5
welcome-to-demon-school-iruma-kun,"I don't know how else to describe this anime but hilarious. It's great. I busted out laughing many times while I'm watching all by myself, loud enough to seem a bit crazy LOL. I went in expecting nothing and came out with everything. The comedy style is light and PG, and has lots of randomness. It's random like Gintama, but more PG and no poop jokes. Watch an episode when you need to chill and have a good time!",5
welcome-to-demon-school-iruma-kun,"I have to say that it usually takes me a few episodes to get a feel for a new anime but ""Welcome To Demon School!  Iruma-Kun"" immediately feels right and ticks all the boxes for some fast-moving gag style entertainment.The characters are fun, the animation is unpretentious and so far, no sign of resorting to distasteful 'bits' to get the viewers interested. The show stands on its own to feet, writing wise. It's a really funny anime.This is a show for the whole family to enjoy - top marks from me and worth a watch, guys!",5
welcome-to-demon-school-iruma-kun,"Some of the situations and comments by the charactors made me laugh out loud--thats NEVER happened to me in regards to an anime.  This isn't exactly what you think it is at first, then just when you think ""oh yeh, I see where its going""  it picks up and does a 180. One of my fav ever animes.  Watch it, its a gentle kind of witty humor with timing that just doesn't happen in anime--in particular what happens to his ""familiar"" makes me crack up.  (Picture Harry Potter making Snape his familiar but Harry not knowing a thing about magic...)",5
welcome-to-demon-school-iruma-kun,"Been waiting for something new to watch, and this is just what I've been waiting forp, animation isn't crap, just a bit above standard animation, voice acting is great and feels alive, the over-exagerration and pacing knows just what it needs to make it not retarded, and it doesn't feel very clique, and I normally don't get drawn into shows from episode 1!I have yet to see more off it and will be pressing f5 none stop til it's release the next week so I'm hoping it doesn't get turned into a clique harem but we do appreciate a beach episode at the end off the season ^.^",5
welcome-to-demon-school-iruma-kun,"Welcome to Demon School! Iruma-kun is a perfect example of why I love anime.  It is fun, fun fun!  It is gorgeously beautiful in its art direction and IS a work of art.  Did I mention how dang fun it is??  It is also compelling and silly.  Even though it is light heated, it has that magic where you come to care about the characters... The over-arching story: even though this is the weakest point... it is not intended to be a tour de force of the heart, not meant to be war and peace... it is a silly light version of the HEROS journey, you could argue... and making friends at school... where you dont understand the rules because you are an outsider, but dang..... these characters are just so good, and the show it truly a beautiful work of art.  I truly love it so much that I want to buy the physical media, and hereby demand many seasons pretty please  10+/10",5

welcome-to-demon-school-iruma-kun,"This show is still in it's infancy this season as of writing this review, but I have been a big fan of the manga for quite a while, so I can base my review somewhat off of that.Here is the breakdown of what to expect from this show (spoiler free):Marimashita! Iruma-kun or the english title they went with,  Welcome to Demon School! Iruma-kun is a lighthearted comedy series set in an academy with some minor romance and action elements. It features a cast of very fun and unique characters that subvert various tropes in the genre and contribute to the charming tone of the series. All the points of conflict in the series will likely not get you on the edge of your seat, at least not initially, but they are still amusing to watch. Overall you should not expect a deeply profound or particularly heavy story going into this series. In terms of Production Quality, they have so far done a great job as well. I have no complaints with the character designs or animations, and the voice acting holds up as well. So, if you are interested in this type of show and do not expect any life-changing experience, I have a feeling you will enjoy it.",5
welcome-to-demon-school-iruma-kun,This is one of the best manga's and anime shows I've actually watched! It's got a good story-line to it. And it gets a bit weird for my taste. Which is perfect while settling down after a long hard days work and wanting to watch some anime before I go to sleep. My girlfriend is also into this type of genre of shows as well and when I'm well in front of her in the episodes. Well... Let's just say I've seen it and she gets mad at me.,5
welcome-to-demon-school-iruma-kun,"Now, I'm not some anime connoisseur, or some sort of elitist aficionado when it comes to the shows I watch (because I watch and enjoy plenty of horribly written and just straight up bad anime).However, I am here to tell you Iruma-kin is neither of those things! In fact, Iruma-kun is quite good! While I don't think it is the most groundbreaking or revolutionary anime of our time (I'd give that honor solely to Steins;Gate only on the grounds that it has made my  mother of all people a die hard anime fan), it succeeds in what it sets out to do: be a fun, wholesome romp about characters misunderstanding the intentions of our protagonist, Iruma-kun, and somehow their lives end up much more positive as a result of these increasingly absurd misunderstandings. Iruma's innate kind nature and inability to refuse people's requests are the core of the show. They drive the show forward, and are also the predominant joke making machines.The show is extremely proficient in setting up your expectations, and doing one of two things:1. A joke, or the set up for a joke, will foreshadow and allude to its own payoff before the punchline even lands, and despite knowing exactly where the joke is going to go, it pays off in a satisfying manner because the absurdity ends up going even farther then you predicted. Iruma meeting Ameri for the first time is a prime example.2. Following the last technique, the show will do a subversion of your expectations, and surprise you with the joke. While not as common as the first technique, it does happen, and the reason it's so effective is because the show is playing with your expectations of how it usually sets up a joke.The show will also continually make call backs to established character quirks, traits and jokes involving them, but using new situations and scenarios to test those quirks and see how they respond. A particular favorite running gag of mine is Iruma's inability to refuse someone's request no matter how mundane, big or small. Needless to say, this puts him into some really crazy situations which only increase people's conflated perception of him as this hyper bad-ass demon mad lad, creating a feedback loop that Iruma can't seem to escape from.I think Iruma-kun is an excellent show. Not groundbreaking or revolutionary, but tried, tested, and true. It's a show that works, with a wonderful heartwarming cast of characters that all play off of Iruma's personality really well. It's hard not to like any of the characters, and despite all of the characters being demons, many of them are more wholesome and human than most of humanity!",5
welcome-to-demon-school-iruma-kun,"I did not expect an anime with a title like this to be this good. I fell in love with the world even though it's the netherworld. It's an anime designed for kids, but it's still a very fun to watch seriesNow that I sometimes am around kids from other parents, I'm nervous about them seeing many animes out there. This would be a series I wouldn't mind them seeing. It's a very clean anime. It doesn't have to go to heavy fanservice to get noticed (at least up until episode 13)I especially like that Iruma seems to have some balance to him.",5
welcome-to-demon-school-iruma-kun,Iruma a poor down-trodden human boy gets sold to a demon by his so-called parents and so our adventure in demon school begins with our hero who keeps trying to not stand out but of course does anyway. I'm really enjoying this high school comedy with a twist the characters are interesting and their have been a few differences from other high school animes inserted into the usual series like this besides being a demon school. I've noted the lack of fan service theirs plenty of magical powers and little violence you could watch this with older kids. I'm giving a low 5 here and a 8.5 on a 10 scale I'd certainly recommend it. I've noticed that this is getting a English dub I thought I'd be watching this again sometime in the future so i'll wait for the dub to finish then watch again in English.,5
welcome-to-demon-school-iruma-kun,"Sounded in the description like a dull pile of rehashed genres - Kyo Kara Maoh + rise of ""ordinary high school boy"" to king of the pirates/yokai/ninjas/demons/etc. + every high school slice-of-life ever. I was bored, so I finally checked it out. Comedy gold! Fundamental premise: this kid has spent his life as a doormat, working his butt off and dodging misfortune. It's given him Super Doormat Powers, and puts him in hilarious situations because he just can't say ""no."" If you doubt that you'll like this, it's actually well worth a view. I'm at episode 10, and so far the plot is ticking along nicely. At first the narrator seems repetitive, but gradually the repetition becomes more and more hilarious, so give it a chance.",5
welcome-to-demon-school-iruma-kun,"This show is significantly better than you would expect. The jokes all land solidly (even the ones that aren't your cup of tea). The characters are all extremely distinct and memorable.At first it feels like its a kids show, but it really does just land for everybody. It gives you that pure feeling while still being incredible for adults to watch. I love all of these sweetheart demons(and boy).",5
welcome-to-demon-school-iruma-kun,"I'm writing this after 9 episodes. The first few episodes were good and now it's just great. They could've just kept him OP and let thing's go stale after a while, but I love how the MC decides that he really wants to climb the ranks using his own power instead of power given to him.It makes me really respect his character development and the show a lot more now, and I already loved the show before. Other than that the show does a really good job so far at introducing and developing characters and gives them enough of their own time to flesh them out a bit more. Clara for example who most of the time is shown cheerful and ridiculously air headed is shown twice to actually have more depth. The epsiode where she is introduced she actually understands her situation more than it seems, and in episode 8 where she has a whole episode dedicated to her showing that she has feelings, wants, a family etc. really developing her character from the funny but sometimes nearly annoying shtick to something heartwarming that you would be glad to have around.",5
welcome-to-demon-school-iruma-kun,"I know, corny review title, but seriously it's the best. The art style is great, the story is hilarious, and the characters are fantastic! The series so far is basically just Iruma not trying to make himself noticed or on one occasion purposefully screw up and it just never works. It is hilarious and I almost want it to take on some more serious plotlines in the future with its same style of humor and charm.",5
welcome-to-demon-school-iruma-kun,"When I first saw this on Crunchyroll I thought that this show wouldn't be any good. I was wrong. I decided to check this out, despite my initial reluctance one Saturday and my god was this show funny! A Human teenager goes to the Demon World and somehow benefits! This show is total comedy, but the intro does seem to allude to possible future action/battles. To me this show is like a hybrid of Rosario Vampire and My Hero Academia. Both shows are great, so this is a good thing! The characters are all crazy and that makes the show! Can't wait til episode 8. Also I'm surprised that this does not have a Dub!",5
welcome-to-demon-school-iruma-kun,"The show is only on episode 6 right now, but I absolutely love it so much!Every episode is another episode of fun! Every episode so far has brought me so much joy. I can not help but laugh out loud each and every time! I highly recommend anyone interested in comedy, demon v humans, school life, magic, or friendship building anime to give this a shot! You will not be disappointed!From the preview I figured it would be a little comedic, but I was definitely not expecting it to be this amazing! The show is so incredibly adorable! But I definitely rate it 5/5 stars!",4
welcome-to-demon-school-iruma-kun,"It isn't just another Isekai or just comedy, once I start watching Welcome to Demon School! Imura-kun, I won't be bored for a single second, things happening are unexpected and fun, despite all that happening it still manages to keep serious feel to it. I find main character and companions very fun to follow and all the characters are colorful with special traits each of their own.Not too good writing reviews but the point is you should give it a go even if it seems different from usual stuff you watch, you may very well like it.",5
welcome-to-demon-school-iruma-kun,"This has to be one of my new favorites of this year. It is a fun anime revolving around Iruma, a human boy who gets taken in as the Grandson of a powerful demon named Sullivan. Thus he starts his life at demon school. Going into this anime I cannot say I anticipated much. However I was pleasantly surprised when I found a fun, light hearted show with a lovable cast of characters! I cannot wait for each week when the new episode comes out. If you are looking for something fun and enjoyable to watch, I highly recommend Welcome to Demon School! Iruma-kun",5
welcome-to-demon-school-iruma-kun,"i was a little worried when i heard they were making an anime adaptation of this series, and after watching the first several episodes i can say i am not disappointed with it. the animation feels like a throwback in the best possible way, after being let down by atrocious CGI animated series in 2019 (im looking at you ascendancy of a bookworm) the late 90's early 2000's style of animation feels nostalgic and pleasant to look at. there's a shocking lack of ecchi fan-service BS and Iruma just seems like an all around good dude. i love his grandpa and the reactions from iruma's teacher when he's forced to use the cute teaching aids given to him. can't wait for this series to continue!",5
welcome-to-demon-school-iruma-kun,"I didn't have high expectations! But even though this is not a complicated storyline with lot of predictability, there's one place where you are pretty stunned: It's pretty freaking funny! There's so many moments where you didn't see that joke coming.The superpower of our main protagonist Iruma is a absolute pushover and that aspect makes the whole story filled with golden comedy for people of all ages. It's a must watch, low intensity, highly funny and wholesome.",5
welcome-to-demon-school-iruma-kun,"So far, i looked at this anime and though, how could this ever be good? This is going to be another soft hentai anime... So far i am completely wrong. It is HILARIOUS. I'm enjoying it so much so far, i want more of it. 5/5 for me right now. Yes it is a little overdone in some occasions, but i do think it helps capture the ""humor"" they tried to implement. Overall I love it. Tend to repeat a lot but it's the beginning so I understand for now 5/5 still imo hopefully it gets even better!!!",5
welcome-to-demon-school-iruma-kun,"This anime is great fun, and hands down in my top #1 anime for this season, considering this anime actually makes me laugh is already a great start, every thing feels natural and well paced between each episode, with the high school vibes going on, and Iruma disrupting the natural balance of the demon world giving that he's a human and all, so it also puts a risk to his life while trying to blend in as a demon, I mean I'm sure nothing terrible is going to happen giving this seems like a pretty friendly anime so far, but anyways, this anime is a lot of fun to watch and really entertaining, that school chant caught me off guard at the beginning.",5
welcome-to-demon-school-iruma-kun,"I saw a clip of the show on YouTube and I was curious, so I clicked it. I wasn't expecting to be genuinely interested in the show, but here I am. I watched the first two episodes yesterday and caught up on the available translated chapters, I absolutely adore this series.I'm genuinely excited to see how far this adaptation will go and I'm hoping it'll get a second season after season one finishes.",5
welcome-to-demon-school-iruma-kun,Okay so I watched the first two episodes and here is what I can say.This is a must-watch!This is the best comedy of the season and it is definitely a fresh approach to its genre. The main character is a cute cinnamon roll and the anime uses this in contrast with the other main characters to create episodes packed full of really funny gags and developments. It looks like there is an overarching plot which means it isn't just a plain comedy anime and I am really excited to see where this goes. Also just a side note but this really fits Halloween that is coming up later this month and I am living for it!,5
welcome-to-demon-school-iruma-kun,"Its just a blast to watch! Every episode so far has just left me wanting more ... All the characters are really enjoyable/comical (like how can you dis-like that in an anime). I bet (FOR A FACT) that you'll always watch this show with a smile on your face. Then again its funny that i'm telling you what ""my opinion"" is when everyone has their ""own opinion"". I say give it a shot! If you don't end up enjoying it ... then you don't have to watch it haha.",5
welcome-to-demon-school-iruma-kun,"At first I thought this was going to be just like a certain other anime story about a human boy finding himself in a demon school surrounded by a harem of cute demon girls.  But boy was I wrong.  So far the harem is made of guys. I don't know if this is a good thing or a bad thing, but we are two episodes in, so I'm just gonna roll with it... I'm gonna crunchyroll with it.  But yeah, it's a good anime.  Watch it.",5
welcome-to-demon-school-iruma-kun,"Welcome to Demon School isn't a bad show, its an un-aggressive shonen high school generic isakai with charming but very two dimensional characters with 'hints' of a third dimension. The biggest problem with demon school is it plays a little ""too safe"" much of its been done, its been done better, maybe not all the elements have been together in one show before but its pretty easy to cherry pick aspects that are done much better in a High School Anime, Isakai, or Shonen. But its a nice un-agressive blend of the tropes that has an abundance of charm and humor with decent enough writing to get its humor across. Not groundbreaking but very enjoyable in a season saturated in Isakaitus",5
welcome-to-demon-school-iruma-kun,"About the best thing I can say about this title is that I did make it through the season. But I've found little to recommend it. The narrative and characters are weak, but not horrible. The voice acting is so-so, with some characters OK, but one in particular is highly annoying. Direction leaves a lot to be desired. The artwork, and especially the animation, are Saturday Morning cartoonish, much below average for a Japanese production. It's just not much of an effort, and strikes me as a hastily slapped together mess, about on par with Pokemon or Yugio. I might rate this about 1 1/2 stars fairly. But I will give it credit for having enough potential in the cosmos created, that I kept watching, expecting something really interesting to happen. Even though I was disappointed, the fact I was not beaten down into giving up, allows me to round up to 2 stars.",5
welcome-to-demon-school-iruma-kun,"This is an isekai anime for sure, and I was about to pass up on this, but decided to give it a try just for the sake of it. While it definitely can't get the 5-star rating, it does have interesting premise and the ""overpower"" condition of the MC is ""reasonable""Quite funny, and based on the first 2 episodes, seems quite interesting and might have redeeming quality despite being an isekai anime.That said, unless the character has good development or it adds the comedy element, it will just stay average. Depending on people, average is relative. I saw some people said that ""Isekai Cheat Magician"" is average, for me, that anime is trash. it's a 0-star anime. Average is 3-star, and thus the rating right now.I hope it can get to a 4* by turning more of a comedy isekai (like ""hattage kemono michi"") rather than going into overpowered but stupid isekai.",5
welcome-to-demon-school-iruma-kun,"Shounen.If you're looking for a shounen to watch about a pretty much tame, almost wimpy boy, who doesn't really seem interested in becoming more than what he is?Well this is an anime for you.  Obviously the MC eventually starts to change, but the initial impression of the MC can be a bit lackluster.However it is a very Shounen story that is very Shounen in nature and very Shounen in orientation.  If you don't like shounen don't even touch this, but if you absolutely love shounen you're going to need to watch this.",5
fire-force,"So, you haven’t watched Fire Force yet? Well then, lemme ask you....did you watch/read Soul Eater? Sure, the ending isn’t all that great for it, but the manga author had a better ending intended. Anyways, the creator of Soul Eater has been cooking up a new series for a few years now, and it’s pretty great. Now, let me ask you a different question....do you watch/read JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure? Sure, this show has nothing to do with Fire Force, but if you like JoJos for the animation quality, then I have good news for you. David Production, the animation studio for JoJos, picked up this series for an anime adaptation, and let’s just say....they brought the heat (pun absolutely intended). So with all of this being said, if you liked Soul Eater, or if you like action anime with great animation and amazing fight scenes (or if you’re just a pyromaniac) then you should definitely start watching Fire Force!",4
fire-force,"This review will be a bit lengthy but I have a lot to say I have been reading the Fire Force Manga since it released not too long ago and honestly I am very happy with the approach they took from what I have seen in the first episode(Only episode 1 is out at the time of this review). There are few minor changes the anime had from the manga but it you cant include every little detail from the Manga, I was happy that even though they made the changes to try to fit the 24 minute mark they still included context about them (I,E having a quote be said in the Manga but just put in another scene to save time). The episode felt a tiny bit rushed but not anywhere close to bad (Looking at you Index III) I felt like some scenes from the Manga could have been included instead of the pan shots of the cathedral but obviously they wanted to use their resources for other scenes. Speaking of other scenes the fight scenes are FIRE pun intended. I expected as much from David Productions and they sure delivered. Imagine Soul Eater style fighting with modern animation from a studio well known for fight scenes. I was blown away from how smooth they animated it and trust me its not easy trying to animate a flashy fight going a million miles an hour with fire all around while still keeping crisp animation in every frame. 10/10Lastly the CV's they chose for each character is perfect. When reading the Manga the voices I gave the characters in my head are basically the same as the CV's. Gakuto Kajiwara on Shinra was perfect honestly and sometimes you can hear a little Asta in his dialog but its not the exact same (which is a plus). M.A.O on Iris is the best choice honestly I have loved M.A.O's work as Kyoko Takanashi from World Break, Enri Emmot from Overlord, Renren Tomaru from The Failed Knight (Which was awesome giving her a hyper character to change it up!) I could go on forever about M.A.O but she was honestly one of the best parts about this show (I am also very Iris bias so this is a dream come true) The other CV's for each character are also amazing I especially can't wait for Yūsuke Kobayashi as Arthur (Subaru as Arthur!!!!) The Opening song Inferno by Mrs Green Apple is a super nice touch! Super catchy the more you listen to it. In my top 10 OPs of the season for sure I enjoy it more than Dr.Stone's OP tbh.And lastly the ED... I loved it.l... Main reason: Iris. That is all and if you where able to read this review to the end and you actually took the time for this review I thank you. You are a true person of culture!",5
fire-force,"This show introduces the characters quickly, but good character writing and design makes them all stand out immediately. The premise - a world faced with both tragedy and mystery - is interesting as well. There's a lot going on here, and it's all been done pretty well.The structure of the world branches out almost immediately, and there's some great action sequences. So far this one is a winner and is well worth a watch.",5
fire-force,Are you ready to fight fire with fire?  Do you expect to use water and other normal methods of firefighting? TOO BAD!  Now you can fight fire by kicking a fire demon in the face with a fire kick why does this work?  BECAUSE SCIENCE!! so bring your Charizards and your flamethrowers friends time to save the day and kick some fire demons in the teeth! P.S like fire nuns man.  P.S.S this would actually be ludicrously effective.,5
fire-force,"My favorite creditor of Soul Eater is back with an awesome Anime called Fire Force. I loved Shinra so much. He got Bagkuo Fight style but Izuku's ambition to be a hero. This anime has an amazing opening and has a shot for season two. The Best anime every. I would love to read the manga too. You will have a blast watching this anime with its soul eater vibe. I can't wait to cosplay Shinra over summer comic con. My Rps Izuku is like Shinra, He uses dragon slayer magic like from Fairy Tail to fight and get around places. I hope these anime get an award for the best anime, I love this anime so much if take Bagkuo Quirk then Izuku using hand and legs to fight then add a little soul into the mix you gwt Shrinra,  So pumped for Sho Vs Shrnia.",5
fire-force,Story starts slow and only the great animation kept me in. But when figures start showing themselves and more ties are being drawn you start to see the depth of the characters and the noise. Some people complain about the fan service but honestly its nothing that impedes upon the action of story. Its even less of an issue than the fan service from Food Wars!. Anyway the story gets quite interesting when other units make an appearance and you are left to wonder exactly who is good and bad. Stick with it. You wont regret it.,5
fire-force,First thing I want to say is that I like this show. I think it could get better. But at around the half way point of the series it seems to start dragging. It feels like nothing ever is being achieved by the main team. Who new that the show about fire would burn me out the fastest.Edit: so as of episode 21 it has gotten a lot better. Stuff is actually happening again. So my rating is going from a 3 star to a four star.,5
fire-force,"It is an anime I wish I could binge watch because of course there is a cliffhanger each time. The premise is pretty interesting and I love the animation! The Fire Force has a lot of different parts so there are times when I wish they could delve into subjects more but I will need to continue to watching to see if they'll go into it. I'm not personally a huge fan of fan service, but it isn't super overbearing. Will update later on in the season.",5
fire-force,"I don't think i am the target audience for this anime anyways, but I wanted to like this anime, and there was a lot of hype surrounding it when it came out. However, after finishing the first 12 episodes and heading into the fall season i found myself with no desire to continue the story. I think if i was in high school or junior high or something i would enjoy it, but I'm tired of the same old Japanese humor such as the girl that always finds a way to lose her clothing. She is embarrassed and the guys are pervert act. The characters are cliche and probably more relatable for someone going through adolescence.",5
fire-force,"I can't say that I dislike Fire Force because I keep coming back every week for the new episodes, though that might just be because of the opening. I say this because from the very start this anime hasn't been very good about giving the viewers a good background or even a good grasp at all of what's going on. They are quick to add plot elements that are never explained and seem to dote on the less important parts of the plots and jump around instead of focusing on the main idea. That said, the story in of its self has great potential and is quite unique. The art style and the action scenes are very well done and make the show exciting to watch even with the lack of story structure. I still hold out hope as the newest episodes have been seemingly more plot motivated, and I'm excited to see what transpires in the next few episode of this series!",5
fire-force,"I always wait to review a series until I've finished every episode, but this series has been different and I feel warrants an early rating. The animation style and sound are utterly perfect in every way; it's incredible the depth of feeling and emotion they're able to convey in the fights each episode. The storyline and premise of the series is quite unique as well and I'm excited to see where the series goes and how it will progress toward the MC and the 8th fighting against the Evangelist and his crew. Honestly, the only slight downside is how the lucky-perv trope feels forced in multiple instances, but I'm no so stuck-up that I'd hold that against the rest of the series; it's not actually THAT bad, but sometimes it just feels like they're pandering to 12 year-olds a bit strongly... SERIOUSLY, everything else about the series is fantastic and I've loved every episode thus far. I'm looking forward to the rest and I know I'll enjoy the ride!",5
fire-force,"While this show feels promising, I've consistently been disappointed with it's story, characters, and creative choices. You may find you're happy to overlook it's flaws, or may just turn it off after an episode or two, sick of the little things they consistently get wrong.On a positive note, the animation is superb, and the overall theme and world is interesting. This show has a solid premise, and feels like it could go places.On a negative note, the characters feel weak, and their behavior frequently feels unjustified or unusual, especially the villains. The ""fanservice"" is a nuisance that feels gratuitous and obnoxious rather than enjoyable. I'm not religious, but the anime-inspired supernatural Christianity comes off a little tone-deaf, rather than being something sincere that brings depth to the setting.",4
fire-force,"Now in order to review as a fan, you don't go with just facts, most of it will be biased. That's what fans do, they ignore facts and go on with their personal opinions. If someone called you trash simply because they didn't like you, that's an opinion and they have their own reasons. So here I go. I'm giving this 5 stars because, well, I really like it. I'm sure someone out there will find the flaws, but to me this is really personal. I often find my life dragged by societies way of being stupid. Whether it be calling the air conditioning to believing the Earth is flat I find them very stupid, and I find myself looking for something, or someone to change that. How I see this anime is that it focuses UN-corrupting the world by becoming hero's. And also finding a way to serve true justice. I see this anime as the examples of what people today should see as a fitting example of a human. People who only want to do the world a better place.",4
fire-force,"Firstly, Soul-Eater style animations, boosted by the crispiness and intensity of 2019/2020 design improvements - huge, in every regard. Every scene is just amazing to look at. More importantly, the story, miles of room for any necessary character development complemented by interesting characters. Every side-character lore is, if not necessary, at least interesting, which is hard to achieve. Whether you watch the show weekly or all in one sitting, it is definitely one of the best current running seasonals ❀❤︎",4
fire-force,"This show so far has been a great trip, and I can't wait to keep watching!  So far this show has shown really good animation, art, music, and story (Especially such a unique story at that). The whole show feels pretty fresh, my ONE and only issue is that they censored the outro after the first three (Don't quote me) episodes which definitely doesn't seem necessary. This show is a definite watch and you're missing out if you aren't watching.",5
fire-force,"Starting off summer this anime is definitely in the top 2 only comparable to doctor stone,Art:  the colors and the animation  is so well done.  David productions really went all out. when making Fire force, Everything starting from episode 1 is just colored so bright and vibrant it,  from the colors of the fires, to the colors and shapes of each characters eyes when they get serious.. you can really just appreciate how much time and effort was put into it each scene. Leaving you to want more after each episodeStory: is 10/10 in my opinion . After watching episode 1 I was instantly hooked. To the point where I had to read the manga which I finished in 2 days LOL.  It's about a boy who always wanted to become a hero, however one day he suffered a accident that made him lose everything. and now growing up he decided to still hold on to his dream but while becoming a hero he realizes he will need to uncovered the secrets in society. From reading the manga and comparing the animation it's paced really well!Characters: ALL ARE GREAT LUL.Shinra,Arthur, Iris and Tamaki are the best!",2
fire-force,"Ten/Ten this is probably my favorite show this season. It's an awesome slice of Shonen action, with amazing animation, fight scenes, AND as the great Gigguk often says: ""The opener is a ******* banger!!"" A steampunk futuristic post apocalyptic world where people spontaneously combust...well, that certainly raises the stakes a bit. And the waifus, dear friends, oh the high quality waifus. Get ready for twenty four episodes of this awesomeness, because Fire Force is...dare I say, LIT.",4
fire-force,"the first 2 episodes were pretty good, animation good, fighting good, characters good, but that is all in my opinion. after the 3rd and 4rth episodes, i really started getting into it,  there was a plot and a lot of unanswered questions that they were trying to uncover, 4rth episode was kinda weird, but also really good, one thing i really like about this is their expressions, and personality's, it's so different then anything else, i don't know how to explain it but it's amazing. One last thing is the cut scenes, like the expressions, i don't know how to explain it, but it's so smooth.",3
fire-force,"please watch this show. from the two episodes out right now, this show is definetly amazing. in the first episode we get action packed scenes and we meet awesome characters, we get a cool and mysteryious plot, a sad backstory and more. and in the second episode we got a new member of the team arthur and i love him. we also got a sad and emotional mission where they have to take out a infernal that is pretty much asking for death and it made me really sad",5
fire-force,"Seeing that there are only 125 reviews of this show, I felt the need to say my piece. Some of those reviews seem to be by people who didn't actually watch the show.  If you're reading this, ignore those others.  They don't know what they are tallking about.  How about the people who liked the show giving it a review?  Here's my (very short, no spoilers) review:This show is awesome.  I was hesitant at first, I mean really; spontaneous combustion? But now it's the end of the season and it has become one of my favorite shows.  Oh, and the soundtrack is great, the art is superb and the story is well worth watching.  So watch it already!",2
fire-force,"The first few episodes were sorta slow paced but if you stick with this anime i promise you'll learn to love this series. Fire force became one of my favorite anime in only 3 short months. Animation is top tier, characters are really cool and likable in addition the theme of the anime is really well made. The fan service does get a little annoying but i think the incredible fight scenes and music easily make up for it. The characters actually have unique but quirky personalities and i think if you're looking for a good anime to binge watch look no further. Plus it's only 24 episodes so it's perfect length. Happy holidays!",5
fire-force,"In a world shaped by mighty flame, Spontaneous Human Combustion exists. Humanity has been plagued by this phenomenon for over a century. Sudden death by flame, followed by a rampaging infernal corpse demon left to terrorize any in their wake. Tokyo's Armed Forces, Fire Defense Agency, and Holy Church of Sol needed a solution, as which lead to the creation of the Special Fire Force. A collection of soldiers and pyrokinetics gathered to combat the oncoming fires. Shinra Kusakabe is one of the rookies gathered from the latest generation of firefighters. A young lad who nicknamed the Devil's Footprint for his abilities to generate fire from his feet. He joins the force to be a hero, and search for the infernal that claimed his mother and younger brother twelve years ago. His battles in the force will soon reveal that the fire's smoke has some mirrors, mirrors to be shattered and reveal the hideous truth behind their world of flames.Fire Force is the latest Shounen to take the anime world by storm, or, at least it had the potential to be. The hype for this anime is real, it showed such early promise from its praised animation, to its steady pacing, and of course its stylistic usage of fire. So what went wrong? This anime was shaping up to be real anime of the year material, but for me and many other people it just kind of lost our attention. Was it a weakness in the writing? Too many slideshows in the animation to save budget in between the fight scenes? Typical Shounen fight scene problems? Did other anime such as Demon Slayer's second half steal away its explosive premier? To answer all those questions, yes, but also no.In truth the problems I personally see in Fire Force as a whole are just few, however their repetition is the real issue. First off I have to talk about the animation, because it really isn't as good as it was made out to be. Yes, early on there are plenty of scenes to be hyped about, to watch repeatedly cause they are so damn good. However as the show went on, the lack of physical movement within its many non-combat scenes was difficult to ignore. I don't care about fantastic animation anyways as an anime fan, yes it's great to see, but seeing how most anime originates through manga popularity, I think we all can live without Fate budget level fights as long as everything else can hold our attention to the screen. To put it simply, if you were to watch this anime dubbed, 90% of the time you wouldn't miss anything if you didn't pause the anime to read a text on your phone. Especially when the anime slowly started to forget that it had a whole cast of characters to work with. A lot of Fire Force's charm was thanks to the dynamics between Company 8's members, sadly in typical Shounen fashion, Shinra takes center stage halfway in and didn't feel like sharing. Don't even get me started on how Tamaki is handled, or lack thereof. Or how Iris is basically forgotten about completely for the second half. All while Shinra himself, I'm gonna be honest, I don't like him. He's incredibly stubborn, and it's played up in fights for way too long to the point of banality. Also based on the few times he and Tamaki interact, I wouldn't be surprised if he's sexist. (Keyword being wouldn't be surprised, I'm not directly calling him sexist.) Not to mention despite his faults or naivety at times, he never gets in any real danger. Or it's the complete opposite where he is in all of the thinkable danger imaginable, and still gets out with little to no long term effects. Kind of the equivalent of say like Deku from My Hero Academia not having scars on his hands to remind him not to act recklessly. With the way Fire Force is structured as a whole, I'd argue nobody really grows or learns from the events that happen. It really feels like this anime is trying to be hype for the sake of trying to be hype, a lot of things don't really make sense, but are not played up for laughs either. Which ended up creating this weird middle ground where nothing really happens, and with that aforementioned lack of animation across during a majority of the anime, it really needed to play up more laughs with the cast as a whole.So after everything I just said, is Fire Force worth your time? That's a big maybe, in my opinion it is good fodder to turn your brain off, but is too stagnant outside of its fights to keep your attention as the plot moves forward. Fire Force isn't over yet, it is set to pick back up for a season two in the summer of 2020. It might hit the ground running now that the groundwork is set, or it will continue to dwindle it's own flame before being blown out by the many other highly anticipated anime coming next year. Only time will tell how the Fire Force's flame will act.",5
fire-force,"Fire force has a very special place in my heart ❤️!!! Pros: The series has HOLY TEIR animation, The comedy is good when you think about how ridiculous it is, The storytelling and world building makes me think of so many different things and this series dominates creativity because not many other series have been as interesting and creative as this one! Fire force isn’t always crazy but it actually takes time to build plot which a lot of series tend to skip when actually making episodes which leaves plot holes but this series sticks to a good script with some weird pacing here and there but it still looks great! Overall I literally love this anime and like other anime I feel like it deserves a complete adaptation to be remembered in the books as the coolest anime about fire fighters (Also this show puts respect on firefighters because they truly risk their lives everyday protecting us and I greatly appreciated them!!!) Cons: As of 2019 December 5th, There is a lot of hate for fire force and people are saying wrong about it just because of small trivial things like one character or a bad op or even not wanting to watch past 10 episodes.... This is a con because people are listening to other reviews rather than turning to look to the series itself and determine wether they want to watch it!! THIS GOES FOR ALL ANIME: if the series has more than 5 episodes... And your still watching it.... MAKE SURE YOU KNOW WHEN YOU WANNA STOP BECAUSE 5 episodes for me isn’t even a preview for what’s to come with most shonen... to be honest I wish every anime could get a complete adaptation but that’s a lot of money.... but this series Fire force, needs a complete Adaptation because while there is hate.... WE ARE STILL HERE!! THE PEOPLE WHO LOVE THIS SERIES ARE STILL HERE AND WE WILL WAIT FOR AN ERA TO SEE THE END OF SPONTANEOUS HUMAN COMBUSTION LATOM!",5
fire-force,"Fire Force is...watchable.  The structure and pacing of the show hit some familiar story beats you'll find in other anime, most notably BLEACH.  In fact, if you like BLEACH, you will most likely enjoy this anime too (although it is definitely not as good as BLEACH)Animation:  5 out of 5The animation is superb.  I really have no complaints here.  This is likely where the majority of the budget went.Story:  3 out of 5It is very tropey, and unless something drastically changes to turn the series on its head, it appears to be a simple ""religious zealot needs to be defeated"" storyline.  Characters:  2 out of 5If the storyline is tropey, the characters are *extremely* tropey, and I feel like this is the biggest let down in the show.  With one notable exception, characters seem to do exactly what you anticipate that they would do in the singular dimension that they occupy.Music:  3 out of 5It never was noticeably good or bad in the show itself, though the season 1 OP was definitely a standout.  Worldbuilding:  3.5 out of 5The show makes a passable attempt at a believable society, and honestly, the premise of the show is interesting (what is society like when any person can turn into a rampaging monster at literally any moment)?  Sadly, the show does not spend the time needed to develop its own world (so far anyway).",4
fire-force,"I'm genuinely surprised at the bad or lackluster reviews that this show has received. So much so I had to write my first review on it. I'm unsure where to even begin.It has an idea that is just classic Anime, random world happening gives people powers. Boy wants to become hero, etc etc. What surprises me is the show's ability to make me re-watch scenes over and over again. The art alone is enough to make me watch, the cinematography is something I find to be incredible. There are things that happen in the story where I just don't understand why it was included yet random little details like that just make me so happy. They're creepy even, the position of characters or the camera angles. The contrast of the dark storyline and happenings to the weird and upbeat dialogue expressed by the main characters. The fact that they don't just explain everything straight up like most anime will. I'm still learning about the world and whats happened to it 15 episodes in, that is good storytelling in my book. Aside from this, all of the characters are so likable, like a little family that I'm watching interact with one another at the 8th. I can see the issues people see in the story, the fan service can come off as forced and they do accentuate character personalities, but it's nothing that is show-ruining.For being something so ""cliche,"" Fire Force simply strikes me as unorthodox and enjoyable. So many things in this anime is just so delightfully random. I know this review was a bit of a mess, but hopefully it'll convince someone to bypass the bad reviews and give it a chance. Cheers.",4
fire-force,"Look, when I first learned about this show I was mega hyped. The character designs were really freaking cool, the production was top notch, and the whole base concept and design of these kickass fire fighters who fight fire with FREAKING FIRE! It was just straight up - HELL YEAH!However... After a full 13 episodes I must say, not only did it not live up to the hype, it just isn't that great in general. What this show has going for it is all the outside stuff like the stuff I mentioned above as well as some very well choreographed fights scenes and such. But at the end of the day this show is devastatingly lacking in character and story depth. The characters and their motivation all feel so shallow because the story doesn't properly build up their background to allow it's viewers to really empathize with them.  To sum it up this show is like a very beautiful woman who hardly has anything going for her aside from her physical appearance. Still worth watching, but don't expect too much aside from the visuals and concepts.",5
fire-force,"I love watching Fire Force every week. Is it the best anime that ever existed? Maybe not, but I'm still going to give it 5 stars, because what it does, it does so well. And there are certain elements which I believe are some of the best I've ever seen. The visuals. Honestly I am amazed every week. It is so unique and beautiful and the animation feels so smooth. It uses subtly different styles to emphasise various scenes or emotions in those scenes. The story is very interesting and I can't wait to see how things turn out. It tackles serious themes but breaks the tension with hilarious character interactions. Nothing is overused and I'm always hooked to the screen when watching. It keeps me interested in each moment - so does the pacing! We're only on episode 10 and, considering where we started out, we've come quite a long way! But not so far that it felt rushed. They've used one or two episodes to let things sink in for us and I appreciate that. Another thing about the visuals - the character designs! With each new character I find myself thinking - omg! I love this character! I can't wait to see what they are like. Even for the bad guys. Everything about each character's designs seems so well thought out. Shinra is also a great, well thought out MC. What more could we want?? The OP and ED are (sorry for this) literally FIRE!!!! I listen to it like I'd listen to regular music. What I mean is, I wouldn't just put it in a ""great anime OPs"" playlist, I would put it in a playlist among other great songs... does that make sense? I hope so! Anyway... I could say a lot more. But I don't want to ramble. The directing of the show is great and so is the voice acting. I can't wait for more.",5
fire-force,"ANIMATION is on point!! Awesome sound design. Awesome fight scenes. Interesting characters. Oh and best waifus of Summer 2019 (imo). Yeah, there's some nice sauce~DETAILS: Humans spontaneously combust into fire monsters, and Fire Force is a special unit that deals with them. The often misunderstood main character joins the Fire Force to be a hero after the tragic death of his family. Company 8 (main character's team) tries to unravel the secrets of corruption and find the reason why humans combust with many battles along the way.",5
fire-force,"this show is definetly popping off now and if you are reading this and you are a anime only, this series is about to get super dark and serious just you wait. my only complaint with the show is that david production isnt doing all the animation but i have no other complaints. this show is definetly a five star show but in general i wish they removed the star system because it could ruin interest in shows.",3
fire-force,"Manga reader here!So do you remember a show called Soul Eater? Did you enjoy the style, presentation, world building and character introspects that drove the plot into multiple interesting turns and themes? Well the same author is back with a different setting and theme for his story, but in terms of writing, has not miss a a beat. Especially with the world building and general presentation part.",5
fire-force,"I don’t know what much to say about this anime except that the animation aesthetic is absolutely stunning. I mean it’s unexpected from David Pro in my opinion (apart from the animation of JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure). Ive usually found David Pro’s other works to be well “just good” in the animation part. Anyhow, so far I’ve enjoyed all of the characters and even with the antagonists, I’ve yet to actually find myself disliking any them. If you’ve watched Soul Eater, then I’d highly recommend checking this out too as the original manga of Fire Force is written and drawn by the same mangaka.",5
fire-force,"One of the best series ive watched this year. The pacing of the narative leaves you craving more. The animation is top notch and each fight is a pleasure to watch from things as minor as the wisps of smoke to the way the fire swirls and warps, there are very few cuts made to indicate force. The audio of this series is heavy and you can feel each burst of fire from our MC. Overall this anime is one you should definitely watch regardless of personal tastes. PS - Who doesnt like jet feet?!!",5
fire-force,i am hearing a lot of mixed things about this show so i wanted to watch it for my self and i am confused on why people dont like this cause this show is god tier. the characters in this how are awesome to the point where i already want figures of them and the story is also really cool to because we will learn more about the infernals more later in the series and i cant wait for more and the tournement arc,5
sword-art-online,"Well this is my first review. As most of you know there are light novels for this series, all of which I have read. And this has been perhaps the best read I've had in ages. The storyline, characters, vastness of the world and romance between asuna and kirito are perfect, and the twists will leave you dying for more. If you're here for an anime with a great storyline, have played any rpgs or enjoy a little romance mixed with action and suspense, then this is the anime for you. Although there has only been 4 episodes (at the time of this review), the anime has covered a substantial part of volume 2 in the sword art series, so from here on out the main and incredible storyline will be followed. Animation & Audio: 10/10The animation is beautiful to say the least, and will no doubt accurately represent the amazing setting from the light novels as well as the character models. The voice acting for the main characters Asuna and Kirito have been spot on (of course), and the sound quality is overall, like the animation, perfect.Story & Characters: 10/10As I hinted at above, the story will have you hooked from the beginning , I'm sure many of you have played rpgs, and if you died in those rpgs, you'd respawn and try again of course. But in this anime, the rpg becomes real life, if you health bar drops you're killed almost instantly in real life. With that kind of premise, this anime will be very suspenseful and engaging.I'll focus on the main characters for now because most of the others haven't been fairly introduced yet. Off the bat you can tell Kirito isn't the average anime protagonist, he chooses to go solo for the sake of his own survival rather than stay with his ""noob"" friend and protecting him in the VRMMORPG. This might seem like a shortcoming, but in the novels he quickly changes upon meeting Asuna (his main love interest+party member), and becomes a character you'll love. Asuna is very strong willed and at first seems to contrast with the anti-social and awkward Kirito, but we later find out how similar they are, and their relationship is perhaps the best I've seen in any other anime or manga.Overall/Rewatch Value: 10/10This anime will only be about 25 or 26 episodes long, covering just volumes 1,2, and perhaps some of 8 in the process, if it does well enough movies and ovas or even another season could be launched, allowing us to further immerse in this incredible universe. And I'm sure by the time this anime is finished (or long before), everyone will be rushing to read the novels, and they won't be disappointed!",4.5
sword-art-online,"When I first watched SAO I was hooked. The premise had been done before but that didn't stop me getting in the show. I figured Kirito could grow to be an interesting considering his position in the world. But the show never gave him any true obstacles to overcome. He was literally perfect or things just worked his way. I mean him trying to be a loner so he wouldn't have to see others was ok. But after a few episodes he was so overpowered he never had to worry. He was paper thin as a character.  Even worse than that the show moved at such a break neck pace I'm surprised I didn't  catch whiplash from it. The pacing was brutal and character development suffered because of it. The show introduced so many characters and we would only see then occasionally. Most of them seemed great but outside of a few brief appearances we never learn more about them. This made believing in Kirito and Asuna romance difficult. It just happened so fast and the show expected us to just accept a character we hardly know is his soul mate. That brings me to the second half. It was entirely pointless and creepy! The return to the real world, his sister/cousin crush, and the vaudeville villain ruined the show. First off they skip over the real world ramifications of the game. We hardly even hear anyone talk about what happened. I mean 10,000 people were trapped for two years and it's basically swept under the rug. We never really see any characters recover from the order at.The show just skips ahead two months. The second half could have dealt with them recovering and making their love work in a world that they don't know anymore. That would have been amazing. But I digress. Then the whole sister/cousin plot line was beyond uncomfortable. It just comes out of no where and makes no sense. We barely know Sugu and she's just trusted into the forefront. Every time she was on screen with Kirito I cringed. They could have taken her character is a completely different direction. Maybe making her a little sister desperate to make a bond with the brother she has become distant with. That would have made her presence make more sense and 1000 times less creepy. But by far my biggest issue with the show is Sugo! He's horrible as a villain and character. Firstly how did he make a game that uses a newer nerve gear and get people to play it? No one in their right mind would use anything like that after the SAO incident. Secondly why would he announce his evil plans to Kirito? Why not just marry her and continue your plans in secret. For a genius he seems extremely stupid. And I don't even want to get started on the final show down. I was angry but couldn't stop laughing it was laughably bad! They should have just had he get run off and kept that outrageous melodrama for something else. I'm not trying to be overly critical of the show. In all honesty I wanted this show to be great they just wasted the chance. I would have loved for them to just slow the pace and let all the characters grow and maybe did a new arc in a second season. At least they'd have a roster of characters we know and care about to keep us hooked.",5
sword-art-online,"When I read the summary of this anime, it actually caught my attention. Surviving in a game that could mean death just sounded interesting. Hence, I decided to give this anime a try. Watching the first few episodes, I truly believed this anime had an amazing vision, and it was going to deliver on it. Sadly it was not to be. The story goes from one of an epic quest to survive towards one basically of a romantic comedy. By the time you go into the second arc, the story drastically goes downhill. The characters honestly felt promising. However, due to time constraints, they were never fully realized. As a result, most of them are bland and have no depth. This anime should have expanded the first arc to the full 25 episodes. It would have given the story plenty of time to grow and for the ending to feel truly great. I know it would have been a masterpiece if it did. Sadly the reality isn't so. Still the action is amazing,and the music is good. Also as generic and stale quite a few episodes got, the series delivered them so well, I often forgot the major flaws in the show. So an okay anime, but it could have been amazing.",2
sword-art-online,"Pros:+ Good action scenes.+ Cool concept.Cons:- Only half the show was good, the next half became less interesting, and seemed to follow the old ""Save the damsel in distress trope."" - Not all the characters were interesting. Some died off way to quickly before even starting to like them.. I was blown away from the beginning of this anime, it was so unique, and has the best fighting scenes i have ever seen in anime period. Unfortunately, the anime slows down, and doesn't seem to ever pick up the action, and the characters such as Asuna, loses character development, and becomes the normal girl who needs her boyfriend to do everything, and save her. It had a great beginning, but i started to lose interest toward the end. Score: C+The Movie Review.It was literally a GIANT recap... Skip it if you have already seen the show.",3
sword-art-online,"So this show is pretty good. The first half is great 4/5 stars. But it's bogged down by the second half of the series which merits 2/5 stars. And here's why:The first half of the series is about people who are trapped in a game that they have to clear to escape. The catch is, if they die in game they die in real life. This makes for some compelling scenes. For one, it actually matters if people die in game. The series can explore the results of actual death and the behavioral patterns that come with it, granted they don't do this as much as they should. They barely explored the PK aspects or the people who choose to not even bother, or the people that band together to help worse players survive. They briefly go over these topics but mostly focus on the main character.So the first half follows our main character who is a solo player and his quest to clear the game, on his way he falls in love with a chick he meets and their love for each other just magically manifests out of practically thin air, He seems to like her because she's pretty and can cook, and she seems to like him because he's a nice guy and strong. That this is all it takes for ""love"" to occur is indicative of the immaturity of anime as genre and the cultural problems and stereotypes associated with the Japanese. As with most anime you get the normal sexist stereotyping of women as helpless, supporting characters who generally are good cooks and unconfident cry-babies. You can imagine my surprise when asuna turns out to be a capable swordsman. Of course she's only capable when it's convenient. Often times she still needs big tough kirito to save her or to take on the tougher enemies. Even in major boss battles that should not be solo-able asuna tends to take a supporting role. But let's ignore the flaws almost all anime have with predictable character architecture and story telling. The world is pretty. Some of the storylines of minor character make the plight of being trapped more real. Some characters don't get explored enough. It's like the makers of this anime looked at .hack//sign which had a very similar overall story plot but chose to tell the story through dialogue and character development. The makers of SAO said, let's not do that, let's make it an action show with lazy character development.The most interesting character choice was to give asuna and kirito a child. But this lasts only one episode in the first half and has no more relevancy until the second half where the child becomes merely a supporting character with no more significance than an information source and plot device.The resolution of the story for the first half is arguably the weakest part of the story-telling. It felt rushed and poorly thought out. For instance, early in the series they get an item that allows you to revive someone 10 seconds after death, preventing them from dying. Kirito gives this item to klein who is at the scene of the final battle. But rather than have Klein use the item to revive asuna, or revive kirito to finish off the boss, kirito just gets mad and ignore the fact that he just died and as a ghost kills the boss. It was super lazy story telling I've come to expect from anime. Also the revelation of the final boss and how quickly that came about and also how the main character had already fought the final boss before makes the final fight kinda boring and uninteresting. Overall the first half of the story merits 4/5 stars at best. Interesting side character story lines that should've been fleshed out and more in depth make the series good. Lazy story telling and stereotypical anime flaws bring it down from 5 stars.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The second half of the anime is terrible. They spend time introducing a flying control device and then the very next scene and episode that control device is entirely irrelevant. Let's ignore that this is poor game design to have a control device for flight that becomes irrelevant the moment you try to learn to fly the right way, this is blatant filler which just goes to show that this second half of the season was just to make money off a brand that was popular. The second half focus' on kirito's quest to save asuna who no longer is a capable warrior but a damsel in distress incapable of saving herself. The one time I thought they might actually let her escape on her own and be relevant to the plot as anything more than a trophy to capture from the final boss led to disappointment. It makes all the airtime they spent showing her learning the code to her cage and escaping pointless because it leads nowhere. It does nothing more than to motivate kirito to try to suicide out of desperation into ""heaven"" or the top of the tree, w/e. The entire result of that sequence is, we know asuna is there for sure and the new supporting character, kirito's sister figures out kirito is her brother. Which at MANY, and I mean MANY points could have happened if these two characters had half a brain or interacted at all in real life like human beings.Which brings me to why this second half is f-ing terrible. It's all about how kirito's sister is apparently in ""love"" with her brother who is in love with Asuna. But then she meets kirito and over the course of a week, yes you heard me, a week, falls in love with the online persona of kirito, her brother but she doesn't know that. The very fact that she thinks she loves somebody she just met on an online game is already pathetic story telling. They have no bond other than she thinks he's a nice guy and he's strong. But she has very little context for this other than him saving her and her game leader by fighting and killing players (who don't die permanantly obviously).After barely knowing the guy she is in love with him, she also still loves her brother for some unexplained reason, despite the story even telling us that he and her barely interact at all in real life in the first half of the story. Apparently Japanese women are very easily attracted to guys because all you have to do is be nice to them a few times and they will fucking die to have you love them if you're a man.Of course it eventually breaks her heart when the brother she hardly interacts with winds up loving asuna. So she clings to kirito as her love. Of course, in the most convoluted way, she winds up finding out that kirito is her brother and is heartbroken.I guess they are trying to form some sort of love triangle romance. But that's what makes the second half of this series so shitty. For one, the love triangle isn't believable. It's hard to even feel bad for sugu when she has her heart broken because her love isn't believable at all. We have no context to understand why she would love the main character so much other than that he's the main character and she loves him. At least with Asuna x kirito we have some scenes that show them together and growing closer through shared circumstances of terror, fear, joy, etc. What makes this fact the problem with the series is that nothing else really interesting happens at all. Many people complain that they feel the episodes are getting shorter in the comments on the videos. You know why this is? Because more and more screen time is given to this drama that doesn't really matter and less and less time is given to actual story progression. The pacing of this show turned into a fantasy show to soap opera between story arcs.And that's why the second half gets 2/5 stars. The fact that death isn't a consequence means there's no tension in any of the scenes for the second half and they lean to heavily on the ""romance.""Because you can't separate these halves you get 3/5 stars as my over all review for the series. If the second half of the series had never happened, and they just ended the first half with asuna and kirito waking up and living happily ever after, that would make this series worth 4/5 stars.",3
sword-art-online,"When I first heard of SAO it was during the time it aired, back in late 2012. I didn't watch it at the time because, for whatever reason, I thought it would be lame and didn't even give it a chance. At the time, at quick glance, it looked childish. This is something I do a lot. I hate wasting time and lots of times will over look what in fact is a stellar show. SAO was one of those cases. This show is absolutely amazing.I am very glad I gave this show the chance it deserved a few weeks ago. I've watched my fair share of anime and I can truthfully say I have never come across a show as engrossing or addicting as this. The characters seem to have a depth of emotion and believability that at times was heartwarming, sad, inspiring, at times comical, scary and even would make me angry. And I think that is the heart of the show. The concept is great, as any hardcore MMORPG player can tell you, but its the characters and their own struggles and relations that are the heart of the show. The Kirito x Asuna love story is among the best in anime; alongside an awesome cast it makes for a great combination. You'll see these normal people, some that become great leaders or martyrs, others that fall into the depths of insanity and evil, all trapped in a virtual world where death is real and always just around the corner. That is why you should watch this show.",3
sword-art-online,"There can be little doubt that SAO is one of, if not the best new shows of the season. That being said, I have some significant issues with the pacing and ending of the first story arc, and since the reviews for this show on CR are almost entirely 5-star ravings of how amazing the show is without any critique, I'm endeavoring to fill that void. There are plenty of things SAO does well, but if you want to know about that, read the other reviews. If you are curious to know why this show isn't the second coming of Trigun, read on.Beware: minor spoilers ahead, but I'll do my best to be vague about specific plot points.Episodes 3-6 were relatively weak. Instead of continuing from where the first two episodes left off, the plot jumps two years into the future and tells isolated stories about side characters you have no reason to care about, while the main character himself is never in any real danger, so the tension of the death game the first episodes create is lost. Would have preferred more time spent in the first few months with all the chaos and tension which would have arisen from thousands of trapped and terrified gamers.Episodes 7-13 are better, with the two main characters relationship being developed, allowing the viewer to actually care about their well-being (as opposed to the side characters in the early episodes, whose peril is supposed to invoke serious drama, but when you've only known them for 15 minutes, their death is rather meaningless). There are still side characters who pass through with their own drama which I felt detracted from the main story, but at least now the main characters were developed enough to keep you engaged and rooting for them.Episode 14 (big spoilers here) was horribly disappointing. An epic boss fight begun in the previous episode is ended abruptly and with barely a whimper. The villain is revealed, and then defeated via what is essentially magic (the main characters performing feats outside the bounds of the game's programming, aka the writers cheated). Finally, the mass-murdering creator of the game, when asked why he did this, literally says ""I forgot."" How compelling...or not.The next story arc has only just begun, but looks promising and I will continue to watch SAO every Saturday. However, I wish the writers would take a better look at the pacing and give the anime time to develop all characters at a reasonable speed, not just the main two protagonists. I realize this is based on a manga which goes into greater depths on many plot points, but this anime has enough potential on its own not to be shackled into retelling the meta-narrative of the manga in an abridged form.",5
sword-art-online,"This is my very first review.Setting: I did like the setting. The first three episodes were a good following to the plot, but after that, it went downhill ( In my opinion ). There was countless fillers, and the second half wasn't even necessary.Characters:I did like Kirito's character, but everything in SAO just went his way. Like the time where he almost died to Kuradeel, for example.Asuna was good the first few episodes, but became useless in anything without Kirito.Animation:The animation was nice, especially at the boss fights. Well, that's it. This isn't a bad anime, but it could've been better..",5
sword-art-online,"Beautiful and engaging, this series makes you see and think what some might do if trapped in a world where life is safe only if you engage the dangers that surround you. The main characters in this story pull at your heart strings as they struggle to escape this trap of epic proportions. Action, suspense, life, death, and love, this story keeps you hanging on every plot twist and turn, making you want more. I hope to see what challenges Kirito and Asuna overcome if they continue the series as far as the manga progressed.",3
sword-art-online,"SAO probably has my favorite first few episodes in any anime. It hooked me right from the start with excellent visuals and an awesome story that no gamer could resist. It continued being solid for the first 14 episodes. Then they moved to AO... I was kind of shocked honestly. The stakes aren't nearly as high, the villain is annoying, the character models aren't nearly as cool, and they took away Asuna's badassness. I could go on but I'll some it up by saying that the last 10 episodes were awful. Stop at 14.",3
sword-art-online,"First off this isn't the ""BEST ANIME EVER"", just to be clear.With that being said though, it is still a great anime.Sword Art Online, an adaptation of a short series manga worthy of being a recommendation on anyone's list. The anime revolves around Kirito, a teenage boy who is trapped in a virtual MMO game with 10'000 other players. The premise of the game is to fight up the tower of which they start in and reach the 100th floor, whilst avoiding death at all cost as dying in game results in dying in real life. The anime story is quite solid, based around the concept of being able to be in a virtual game (Body and all)  is a great start (who doesn't want to be able to go INTO a game right?). The anime is solely based on Kirito's journey in the game, which is its first downfall however, seeing as the other characters lacked a lot of depth that they should have gotten (Characters such as Klien and Egil, look like such interesting characters, but almost seem like strangers since we dont know anything about them..) However it is understandable seeing as this is a short series anime. Another problem with the story was the time jumps, as said previously the anime is a short anime, therefore it was necessary to do this, however I think that most people, including me would have preferred if the anime continued longer; which would have allowed us to continue to watch the journey of Kirito AS WELL as the other characters in the anime (I'm sure there were much more adventures and monsters). The only other character that gets any sufficient depth would be Asuna, Kirito's romantic interest, which is also a nice addition to the anime as there is a lot of romance elements in the anime which is very well done as well.With this being said, the anime still does remarkably well. With the first few episodes being extremely engaging and entertaining with the introduction to a virtual gaming world, as well as the loss of friends and comrades. However the anime does lose this momentum as it goes onto its latter episodes, which is probably due to the lack of depth the anime actually gave to the characters and the world itself. Seeing as the animation in this anime is very beautiful with vast landscapes and bustling towns, the animation and artwork alone can be compared to that of other top tier anime.All in all, the anime does well as it was very entertaining to watch. With an awe inspiring world that SHOULD have been showed off more (I think most viewers didn't really even care about the artwork, as it was not emphasized much.) and captivating journey of Kirito and Asuna, with the emotional short stories of friendship and loss. Sword Art Online is a must watch on my list, however the anime leaves viewers with a bit of an empty feeling at the end which is the thing that stops me from giving this anime a full 5/5, as everyone i believe, knows that this anime COULD have been and SHOULD have been even better.(None the less, its still a great anime :] ) 4 / 5 stars :DIf you liked this review, please give it a thumbs up and check out my profile for other anime reviews",4.5
sword-art-online,"The title says it all. Any novel-to-anime adaptation, if you're read the original text, is going to fall far short of the source in terms of story and detail. This doesn't doom a series, or no adaptation would ever come out - any half-competent writer and director can make the resulting product entertaining while stripping out parts that would not adapt well to a video/audio medium. In the case of SAO, this is done. But a whooooole lot of content is gone, and what's left is a pretty generic romance/heroic shounen story with a mildly interesting premise. Production values are decent - a solid voice acting cast gives life to the characters, and Yuki Kajiura's familiar rises can be heard during action-packed sequences.But for all the bells and whistles, there's not a whole of interesting meat to it. Kirito and Asuna's love story is a decent one but even in the novels it devolves into a damsel-in-distress plus harem situation, which the author actually apologized for because he needed to sell copies and establish a franchise before he had room to write the stories he wanted. The SAO anime is no different, yet even less interesting.If a second season is going to be made, I hope the writers take a good luck at the immense amount of source material they have to work with. A boy/girl romance and heroic struggle may put your foot in the door, but SAO has a wealth of interesting topics and storylines (Mother's Rosario, the Aincrad short stories) that deserve to be animated. I don't have a lot of faith this studio will pull it off, because they seem to value sexy fanservice more than a good plot.",4.5
sword-art-online,"This was one of my very favorite anime up until the second half. The beginning was awesome and so much fun, but the plot changed half way and it became disappointing and difficult to watch. Significant flaws:-The biggest letdown for me was how Asuna, who was so awesome, powerful, and cool, became totally helpless and pathetic in the second half. -Towards the end it got really cheesy and everyone cried all the time. -The final battle scenes were dragged out and exhausting, which made them loose all suspense and excitement.  Positive aspects:-the animation is awesome and the movements are clean.-the music is well done and fits the scenes-Kirito's and Asuna's love in the first half is really sweet and romantic-the original concept is really awesome!This is one of the most overrated anime of all time, such a let down! It really started to go downhill after around episode eighteen or so, and it got so bad that it totally ruined the entire anime. I might rewatch the series up to the fourteenth episode, and not continue from there because I love the first half so much. I feel bad for giving SAO two stars ><Anyway, I'd recommend Sword Art Onine if you are looking for a great anime concept, but only if you are willing to be let down in the end.",5
sword-art-online,"Overall:So first things first, I'm a fan of SAO and enjoyed what I saw of it (haven't read the light novel), but I do think that it's a bit overrated. All the praise SAO has been getting is a bit exaggerated in my opinion. Nonetheless, I still liked the show. I would actually give it a 3.5, but Crunchy doesn't allow that, so I guess I'll be generous.Note: Spoilers are specific points that I complain about. May or may not contain spoilers (all the events are at the beginning though, so it doesn't reveal anything really)Plot:This show had MAJOR potential as many of you may have seen from the first episode. It was thrilling, eventful, and really well done. But then, everything sort of just went downhill from there. Don't let that sentence scare you; as I said, it's still a really enjoyable show. The pacing of the SAO arc was terrible. Things didn't flow together, time didn't seem to flow right.  Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideOne problem I had was the fact that it took so long to clear the first floor, but such a short amount of time relatively to clear the other 70 floors.  They could have done so much more if they expanded on the actual adventure and let us see more of the SAO world. Actually, it might have been better if they had the SAO arc as a 25 episode season. If given the time, SAO could have explained things better and created more atmosphere and emotion. The psychological aspect of SAO could have been expanded on. The first episode made me think that there would be something more in terms of watching how characters acted. Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideThe whole part with Sachi was done poorly. I didn't feel all that sad for Sachi; she didn't really have a story, or any role at all. She was just sort of... there. She was a very shallow character with no development at all that just couldn't manage to make me cry for her death.  The psychological aspect isn't really built upon and what they did try to do just ended up becoming filler because of the poor execution. That's a loss on SAO's part. It had such great potential that it didn't utilize.Characters:Cliche. Kirito's awesome and OPed. He's the hero. He's the one who saves everybody. Everything goes his way. But hey, that's a lot of animes. In doesn't take away from the experience. My problem was that he didn't have much character for the SAO arc. He was a bit too... dull. Most of the characters were actually kind of shaky.  Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideI still don't understand why Kirito treated Klein so coldly in the beginning. Would you stop being such a weirdo? You're so kind and helpful one moment, and the next you're jaded and too cool to even look others in the eye.  None had much personality, and all were pretty bland. There wasn't much character development, and that goes hand in hand with plot development. Again, the psychological aspect would have done wonders here. Still, some characters were really solid and worked well. Of course, some of these characters were filler and completely unneeded. Lisbeth for example was a filler character. Inter-character development could also have been worked on. The character designs were beautiful.Visuals:I loved the art style of SAO. It's just one of those styles that is easy to get used to and easy to like. The characters were designed well with everyone's personal styles displayed. It also let you get the feel of how they fought. Along with the characters, the landscapes are also beautiful. The art is very consistent throughout, and so is the animation. The futuristic gameplay animations were awesome. I enjoyed the little first person POV parts where we get to see the game from their own eyes. The fight sequences were nicely done which is always a plus.Audio:The voice acting for this show was pretty well done. Everything seemed right, and nothing came out awkward. Pretty run of the mill stuff. It's good I would say. As for the music, the little tracks played throughout the anime were fitting and timed right, helping to add some atmosphere. The opening and ending themes were pretty standard-- again, nothing special about it. They were good songs mind you, just not anything I instantly fell in love with.Extra:I didn't really consider the ALO arc in this review of mine because as I stated previously, SAO would have done better with 25 episodes devoted to the SAO arc. But to get the other season of this anime, here's some extra thoughts on the ALO arc. I stand by my previous statements about the visuals and audio. As for the characters, Kirito progressively got more solid, and his character became more well defined in this arc. Sugu was also a pretty solid character-- not sure why a lot of people dislike her. Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideHer actions are entirely believable, and just as a note: It's not incest. She didn't do anything other than confess. So what if you like your cousin? It's understandable that you'd probably fall in love with them after they suddenly do a personality switch and go from uncaring and cold to loving and kind (especially when you've been craving their attention for years).  The villain, I agree, is just way too... cliche and shallow. He's just a creep. Definitely not the best villain.  Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideAnd the perverted creepiness just threw me off-- I don't want to see Asuna get nearly raped. What is this. Just stop it. And tentacles?! Since when did you have to turn to fan service to pull in views SAO?! One problem that persisted through the SAO arc to the ALO arc was the lack of psychological development and the inconsistency of the characters' mentality. Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hide Kirito, stop hanging out enjoying yourself with those clan leaders, go save Asuna already. Anyway, the plot was not as interesting as the one for the SAO arc, and it had a pretty slow start, but once it picked up, I found myself sitting at the edge of my seat again as I waited for the next episode.",5
sword-art-online,"So I've never actually been an avid anime enthusiast over a good portion of my life but I've been marathoning hundreds of hours of anime shows the past two weeks for a reason unbeknownst to me, maybe to induce myself into a depression or find the meaning of life.  I do want to give my thoughts about Sword Art Online mostly because I feel it's message hit more at home with me.  I've lived the experience as i've played MMORPG's over the past 10 years myself.  I know what it is to find people with common goals and form new relationships that transcend the virtual space into reality.  So it is kind of hard to talk about this anime series without spoiling some major plot points so I guess this review is more directed at other people who have already finished watching it.  As I have just marathoned all 25 current episodes I don't know whether these were broadcast into separate seasons so I'll just split them by story arcs which would be Sword Art Online and ALfheim Online and reflect upon them separately. So skip the sections below if you really want to avoid spoilers.Sword Art Online (episodes 1-14)Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideSo going into Sword Art Online(SAO) I didn't know what to expect as I have not read any of the light novels or read any other reviews online about it.  I was thinking maybe it would be a light hearted take on online gaming but once the main villain appears and sets up the rules of world to the thousands of players in the main plaza it immediately became a serious life and death situation as dying in the virtual world would kill the person in reality.  The real death penalty premise was probably the most brilliant part of the story as the tension it created made every situation matter to the lives of everyone now living in this virtual world and shows us the comradery and corruption that builds up between this community of players which parallels real society in many ways.Of course the main goal in Sword Art Online is to get out and to do that the community has to clear a series of floors and dungeons which hold some powerful bosses that block progression throughout the game.  So the anime borrows alot of simple gaming concepts like health pools, equipment, experience, and general skill progression to convey the power and abilities these people have in the game.  So if you've played a few MMO's or Role Playing Games the terminology is pretty familiar.So one major complaint that I had was that the pacing of the first few episodes was going way too fast and I felt that alot of characters early on didn't get the exposition that they deserved.  For example Sachi seemed like a character who probably could have used another episode to convey a stronger relationship between her and Kirito because she was probably the first person he cared about or even started to love so I felt that maybe her death could have had more of an emotional impact on the viewers so that we could also feel as tormented as Kirito was while he listened to her final goodbye message.  Also other characters like Klein, Silica, Lizbeth seemed underused and basically only appear to build up Kirito's character and showing us what kind of guy he is.After the hastened first half of this story arc we finally get to the real Kirito and Asuna relationship.  They meet early on in the story but they don't journey together after their first few meetings.  So It isn't till a year later that they start to develop feelings for each other but I thought this relationship took the time it needed to demonstrate that while they never met in reality their bond was indeed real and they loved each other enough to protect each other in times of need.  In essence the relationship between Kirito and Asuna is the main theme of the series and many subplots explore the relationship up to a point where they build their own virtual family.Overall I felt satisfied with the way this arc ended and I kind of wish they explored the mind of the main villain some more as he seemed interesting.  The last battle was was a test of the human condition and overcoming it led to their somewhat bittersweet victory.  It was a relief to know that the nightmare was over for those left alive in SAO.ALfheim Online (episodes 15-25)Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideThis story arc is a bit shorter than SAO but I feel it's a more much focused narrative.  Kirito is finally out of the death trap but not all is well back in the real world as his one and only true love Asuna is still living a life of virtual reality as she did not wake up so to save her he has to go back into the online world.  So the basic story line becomes a save the princess type of video game trope.What I found most interesting about this story arc is not so much Kirito's determination to get his love back but rather his sister Suguha's(Leafa) development throughout these episodes.  Even though Kirito isn't technically her brother(adopted cousin) she develops intimate feelings for him and she knows he will never return the same feelings as he is too consumed with Asuna in the real world.  So she escapes into the virtual world ALfeim online and in an ironic twist falls in love with Kirito's avatar in ALfeim online as well.  The revelation when Kirito and Leafa realize that they know each other is done very well.  I couldn't help but feel sympathetic towards Suguha as it was a brutal and soul crushing way to find out that that the person she could possibly fall in love with and forget about her brother in the real world was in the end actually her brother as well.As for the actual society and type of game ALfeim online is I feel doesn't hold the same appeal as SAO.  There is no real tension or drama that you could possibly care about even though there seems to be a well thought out faction system but they really don't get into the politics all too much other than a few scenes where Kirito makes a few friends in high places that sort of help him on his journey to the World Tree. I also thought the new villain was sort of underwhelming, while Sugou is a fairly scummy guy his presence as the main villain just doesn't quite match up to Kayaba Akihiko.Asuna while being the main motivation for Kirito's quest to save her has a fairly limited role and seems pretty helpless even though it's been shown previously that she is powerful person.  I guess I could see why they maybe wanted to put her in this role, perhaps it was more or less to show the will power she has to keep on living despite being stuck in a world of solitude.I felt the ending was actually pretty good, the Kirito and Asuna moment in the hospital was a very memorable moment and you get to see alot of characters return in the final moments to celebrate the events of the past few years.  It's safe to say that we haven't seen the last of Kirito, Asuna, and Leafa as the World Seed program seems to bring new life to other virtual worlds and it's fairly implied that there is more to come in the future which I am thrilled about as I see there is much more potential in this series but if they never continue the anime I wouldn't say I'd be dissapointed as things wrap up pretty well.I honestly enjoyed my time with Sword Art Online as I feel it's greatest strength is the way it conveys online relationships within a close community of players.  The real death penalty of the game only amplifies the emotional bonds the cast of characters experience which truly brings out who they really are as humans beings and further implies the message that even though they live in a virtual world the experiences they had with each other are very much real life experiences.",5
sword-art-online,"As many other reviewers point out, this show is good however it is overrated. Many who can relate or want to relate to the main character will find enjoyment in the show. However if you read any of the reviews out there that are not 5 stars you will get a better picture of what the anime has to offer. Now most of the faults that are in the anime are due to the limitations of a seasonal Anime, such as huge time skips or lack of character development. However i was a sucker and enjoyed the concept of the series and found a translated copy of the light novel. I have to say the written story fills in where the anime lacks. Just like when a book in turned into the movie, many aspects have to be cut from the story to fit the format that is a movie/film. Now its always difficult to compare an anime to its written counterpart (manga or light novel). which is why i give this show a 3/5. If you want read a better review, search for any review that's 2-4 stars. They are likely going to give it an honest review with out the Fanfreaking.",3
sword-art-online,"The story begins on the right foot, establishing its solid concept, and showing off its wondrous animation and backdrops.  However, from there it rapidly plummets in terms of keeping the plot coherent and worthwhile, meaning that despite the great visuals and music, the show can't build up any dramatic tension and therefore is a mostly dull watch.  This occurs due to two main reasons: one, the main character is shown to be perfect in near every regard, and therefore any drama that could have occurred regarding failure is removed as an option; second, early on the plot progresses at a very rapid pace, skipping all character development in a two year segment of time in-game until the all important romance begins, at which point things slow way, way down, and the plot is derailed for around 5 episodes.  To the shows credit however, it pulled off a rather surprising twist in the middle quite well, despite falling back on a deus ex machina moment to explain it. Yet following this twist the show moves forward and proceeds to rid itself of all its redeeming qualities, removing the life or death stakes, locking its strong female character in a cage for 10 episodes, and shifting to a whole new set of characters, which it never takes the time to develop either.Overall, the first 14 episodes aren't absolutely horrible, even if they fail to live up to the concept, yet the remainder of the show is better off skipped.",4
sword-art-online,"Okay, seriously. I need to stop putting off animes that people suggest to me. It seems every time someone suggests something, I end up crying at the end or just laughing until I cough out a lung. Except for Air Gear, I simply don't like that anime.With that, you know when people call something ""not your typical anime""? I've watched those. They're as unique as the tree you point out in the forest, or as easy to point out as a very specific beige car on the freeway. They're really just run-of-the-mills anime that one person decided they enjoyed so much.Safe to say, I didn't find that with Sword Art Online. Sword Art Online is as unique as a $300,000 sports car. It sticks out like a man wearing red in a crowd of black. It's the student that outshines everyone with their top-notch grades.That just means that Sword Art Online is amazing.Plot: It progresses quickly, but slow enough for you to understand the sequence of events. That's what makes it solid. As for the actual plot itself, the basic idea is being trapped in a game, and you have to beat it in order to return to the real world. It's easy enough, but you're only given one life. That sounds just like a bunch of other shows, but the execution is done well. That's 10,000 players on Sword Art Online who are trapped in the virtual world until any one of them beats the game. The premise of the story has happened before, but the way that Sword Art Online does it had me hooked from the beginning. For this type of genre, I find it really difficult to get hooked, only because the story is usually played-out. Characters: There's a female character, Asuna, who fights alongside the main protagonist, who in the second half of the story, acts as the damsel in distress. Despite all that, Princess Peach does not make an appearance. The main character, Kirito, is very reminiscent of Simon from Gurren Lagann; their looks for one, and the way they develop as the story moves along. It's a good thing that the characters in this story aren't useless; a useless character would simply sit there and wait for the protagonist to be their savior (okay, that happens with about 6,000 of the players, but who really cares about what they're doing?).Content: I'll throw it out there that there are some ecchi-like scenes in the second half, but you won't be enjoying yourself the whole way through and as soon as they start, you'll probably want to punch your screen (good job writers!). I also like that the story takes place in a fantasy world, but still draws its roots from the fact that it's a video game. You'll see a character's HUD from time-to-time, and then watch them scroll through their menu in almost every episode, and that's what I think is great about this show. It stays true to its roots and recognizes the fact that it's focusing on a mere adaptation of the main characters.This show, in a sense, is run similar to a harem, but there is only one other character that Kirito will show affection for, aside from Asuna (don't worry, you'll see that relationship coming as soon as you watch it, so it's not even spoiled that I mentioned her name). That's a definite plus for authenticity, and it stops all of the fans from going into a full-blown fan war of who Kirito should end up with in the end. It's so defined, that there's no way to contest it, and contesting it is like asking for the majority of the fans to start a riot in front of your house.Wow, I do have a lot to write about this topic after all, but it seems I've only been watching animes that make me cry this entire week. For some reason, they do make me feel terrible because of how heart-wrenching the events are, but Sword Art Online ties up its loose ends in a satisfying ending. That's a first for this week, and I ended up crying anyways because it ended (such a crybaby). The amount of emotional content in this anime is high, mixed with all the visually-appealing action sequences that happen with a justifiable reason (and yes, a justifiable reason is important to start an action sequence). Miscellaneous: On my to-do list: find the MP3 for the openings and endings. All the music is great, but I hardly noticed. I was too enamored with the storyline that I had no mind to actually listen to the music. The animation reminded me of A Certain Magical Index, in a sense, but while that was the animation style which you can say drew me in, it wasn't the visuals at work. I just kept watching because the anime as a whole drew me in.Overall: You'll simply know when an anime is good, right from watching the first episode. For example, I did say in another review that Lucky Star didn't draw me in from the beginning, but I gave it 5 stars anyways. For some reason, while I didn't like it, I wanted to keep watching, even if I'd sit there bored out of my mind, I was willing to risk just wasting my time. In the end, I enjoyed the series. There's always something about it that keeps you from leaving the screen and there's something that urges you to watch the next episode, and that's what makes it a good series. That's what happened with Sword Art Online.I could've pulled an all-nighter for this anime, but I didn't. I had school the next day. But even as I went to sleep, the only thing that really crossed my mind was finishing that anime. I wasn't really paying attention in class, because I was really just eager to finish. As soon as I got home, that's what I did, and it turns out I was right about wanting to finish; it was bittersweet. I like the ending, but I simply wish I had more to watch. While the ending was satisfying, here's to hoping that they make a Season Two.",3
sword-art-online,"Starts off great with a good storyline. New technology has developed that allows people to play games fully immersed and the flagship game has just launched (sounds like a dream come true to me). Of course things go awry and everyone is trapped in the game until someone clears all the levels. People can actually die in the game and you see real life begin to mix in with the virtual world they're trapped in. Half way through I found myself losing interest as Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hide they beat the first game but ultimately have to go back into another game to find his girlfriend from the first game who had been trapped. I mostly finished for the sake of seeing it to the end. Basically watch it for the first half, stay for the rest if it appeals to you (which it didn't for me)",2
sword-art-online,"Anyone who is a gamer will readily admit to spending numerous hours playing a video game. But what if the game was extreme to the point of being physically impossible to stop playing until you won and an in-game death makes you die in real life?Enter Sword Art Online (SAO), an anime about a video game of the same name. What we have from this show is a survival story set in a high-fantasy world with epic battles and a romance prevailing the virtual veils. Unfortunately, its strengths are balanced out by its weaknesses and for more discerning viewers this can be quite severe. Don’t mistake that for being bad though; for those who can ignore storytelling and character development problems, its strengths more than make up for its weaknesses. Everyone else can expect SAO to be a mixed bag of a series.The first shortcoming of SAO is its abundance of characters. In the first half of the anime the story tries to treat all of them as important but there’s not enough screentime for them to ingratiate themselves to the viewer so it’s hard to care about them when something significant happens. On the other hand, the characters in the earlier part of the series are usually believable compared to almost everyone introduced later on; anyone who wasn’t Suguha was either used for harem fanservice or to give Kirito an opponent. But at least SAO’s second half focuses on the important players of Kirito, Asuna, and Suguha since it didn’t know what to do with everyone else in the first half.This isn’t to say the main trio is flawless though. Kirito switches from someone Hell-bent on saving his friends one moment and being a bleeding heart the next. Multi-sided characters are normally a good thing but Kirito’s differing sides are called exclusively from each other as the plot demands and fails to create any sort of internal dynamic. But this pseudo-one dimensionality wouldn’t be noticeable if it weren’t for Suguha. Suguha has the greatest range of emotion displayed while still keeping the less dominant personality trait passive but noticeable at the moment so that her conflict remains believable; she’s grappling with her own feelings so everything about her should be present. But the best developed of the characters is Asuna. Her change in attitude toward the game and everyone else is subtle and her relationship with Kirito is implied to have developed over a long time in-universe if her gradual changes shown over time are not enough.That’s a good thing since Kirito and Asuna’s relationship is one of SAO’s greatest strengths. There are a few other girls Kirito grows close to but he either meets them before becoming close to Asuna or they get the hint when they see how the two behave around each other. Kirito and Asuna themselves have a balanced dynamic as two warriors who are victorious and defeated in equal measure; neither character is dominant in terms of saving the other. It’s easy for a strong character to be degraded by romance and when it happens here it’s beyond their control and not because of their mushiness; neither suddenly becomes weaker more than it is the enemy being powerful.Unfortunately, this doesn’t exempt Kirito from being subject to random increases in power as the plot demands. We have things like him using a technique that he lost in the first half with as much effectiveness as it previously did in the second half which makes no sense because the technique’s effectiveness requires something programmed into the skill itself and not just his own talent. There’s an explanation of sorts for Kirito’s high base power in the second half but it seems coincidental considering everything else he loses. Other storytelling problems include the final dungeon which doesn’t make sense when one stops to think about the game’s mechanics.The storytelling isn’t all bad though. The first half of the anime does a good job at explaining the gameplay mechanics and usually plays consistently barring a few scenes that make sense in hindsight considering the characters involved. The second half of the anime introduces some lore and new mechanics that aren’t fully explained or demonstrated respectively and seems to lose dramatic tension due to the lack of scope on the urgency. But the conflict is now personal and the time limit of sorts Kirito is on it doesn’t allow him to fully be involved in the game he’s playing out of necessity.But if nothing else the series can’t be faulted on its technical presentation. Barring the troop characters in the various factions, the character designs in SAO are richly varied and colorful down to the minor characters and sometimes lower than that kind of importance; everyone could have been a generic face but Studio A-1 Pictures opts to make the game feel like an entire world with its players. This also lends itself to the storytelling since it makes it difficult to tell who’s important and who isn’t until after the fact; there are no “disposable” characters in SAO. Only permanent death lurking from the towering, skeletal, insect-like lich or the bruiser with a hammer that anyone would want to avoid.The soundtrack is SAO’s other saving grace. Yuki Kajiura’s music in all of its English-Japanese-Latin-Hybrid glory doesn’t fail to deliver on the hopeless battles, the rising determination fights, and the stalemates between characters. Unfortunately, though good, it doesn’t manage to stand on its own. Very good music complements what it’s set to and would warrant wanting to listen to on its own. The music quality also doesn’t last throughout the show as there’s also an equal measure of forgettable synthesized tracks in the driest sense of the word. Ironically, one of the strongest scenes in the anime was one with absolutely no music at all; SAO’s soundtrack might have been better if it used the art of silence more since it demonstrates that it can use the lack of music effectively.The opening of the show, Crossing Field, is beautifully sung by Lisa but isn’t really a boon for the series in itself since strong openings aren’t unique to SAO. On the other hand, the lyrics do an excellent job at conveying one of the show’s greatest strengths in Kirito and Asuna’s relationship. And considering how uniquely everyone is designed, it makes it difficult to tell who’s important and who isn’t meaning anything can happen in a boss battle as Kajiura’s soundtrack plays throughout the fight. Unfortunately, the storytelling and character development problems down to Kirito himself might be too many glitches (flaws) for a game (show) as big as this. People who look too much into flaws may want to avoid this while those who can let themselves enjoy the experience for its strengths might be interested. For everyone who’s closer to measuring the strengths and weaknesses in equal measure, SAO will be a flawed but enjoyable experience.",3
sword-art-online,"First 13 episodes are beautifully constructed, dealing with thought-provoking situations and wonderfully done character development. It's filled breathtaking scenery, great action sequences, a sweet romance, and truly interesting villain. If they had left it at that it would have been a classic in my book, but they had to add on the last 13 episodes that, as a female reviewer, made me angry and uncomfortable. The villain was not interesting at all just creepy, plot line was pretty simplistic, and the portrayal of women (and their emotions) was just degrading. On the positive side though, the action was still pretty great and it had some great humor mixed in. I would still recommend this anime for anyone who loves action, dealing with complex issues, and some romance on the side. Overall, great watch!",4
sword-art-online,"When I watched the first episode of sword art online, i was shocked by how amazing this anime was, the storyline was just great. I just loved the episodes where they were in the world of sword art online. I went by those episodes at the speed of light since i liked them so much... But then came the world of alfheim online. I find that the creators didn't take the time to detail the world of alfheim and just rushed with kirito's main quest: save Asuna. Basically, all what happened in the world of alfheim was this: Kirito meets Leafa, Leafa informs kirito about the world tree, Kirito finds out that Asuna is up in the world tree and saves her. There wasn't anything else that was happening except that, and that's why I was disapointed because in the world of sword art online, ther was not only one main quest but also plenty of other subquest that kirito had to do, like helping the girl smith retrieve minerals for a sword or the girl that kirito met and he helped her get a flower for her pet. Anyways, this anime is very good and i recommend it to the people who love mmorpg's and action animes.",4
sword-art-online,"SPOILERS - THIS IS MY PERSONAL OPINIONA few ep's in and i sincerely fell in love with this anime. It was exciting and attention grasping. I enjoyed the character of the protagonist, i prefer the quiet cool type compared to the boisterous loud type. But what really made this work for me was the ability to die in a game; this added the much serious tone and emphasised the deaths of people within the game. They were no longer 'losers taking a game too seriously' but death meant death. the emotional scenes such as sachi's death were reinforced by this principle and gave depth to the scene. The fact everyone was working together to get out made sense, and clear logic flowed.I could even understand the antagonist, i mean, who wouldn't want to create a virtual world to become a god-like figure? (At the start i even found myself already making theories as to why he may have done this, finding myself taking big interest - one of my most interesting theories being it was all a lie, that no one actually died and he simply wanted to create the total gaming experience by making it seem real; and that all this media, newspapers and forced teleport was all a rouse). This also appealed to me as i do, if i don't say so myself, consider myself a romanticist. Asuna's character being a great match for Kirito. With heartwarming scenes of vicarious living in the forest, really did make me happy.However...... After episode 14 i was truly disappointed. I'm not sure if the author just ran out of ideas or someone else took over but everything fell off the rails. The story definately fell under its expectations that it had set up in the first arc. If they had ended it there, at episode 14, i would have given this anime 5*s, a definite. Lets talk about ALfheim. This realm being one where you cannot die. So straight away the imminent sense of danger is removed. What really angers me though is that it lost common sense; i myself, am an online gamer, WoW, LoL, Guild wars, you name it. But these people DEFINITELY take the game too seriously, you can't die so it just doesn't make sense as to how far people seem to take it seriously. This really angered me, how they took the best concept, the underlying principle that made the emotion scenes more deep and murdered it. Everything up to episode 22 seemed like a poor blur to me, the only highlight being a focus on the character development of his little sister which is the only emotional connection to the second arc i could see. Now surprisingly, i found Sugou to have a fitting character for an antagonist for the second arc, even though his appearance... well, he was a butterfly. His character being evil, maniacal and horny. The last fight was a disappointment, being shadowed by that of the first arc.I do, however, want a second series as i thoroughly enjoyed the first 14 episodes. I hope this anime will redeem itself as it shows it has the potential to be a classic 5*.NOTE:I would have much preferred it if they spent the whole 25 eps focusing on SOA instead of the poor second arc. The first was rushed IMO.",4.5
sword-art-online,"As an avid anime fan who has seen hundreds of anime, I can honestly say that this anime is one of the most memorable anime to have been released in the past few years. Everything about is is high quality. From the artwork to the voice acting to the animation, everything is well done. Many people have complained through their comments that the pacing of the first season (ep. 1-12)  is too fast, or that the the relationship between Kirito and Sugu, in season 2 (ep. 13-25) is incest. THESE ACCUSATIONS ARE NOT TRUE. I agree that the pacing or timing of the first season was fast, but it had to be because that's how it is in the light novel that the anime is based off of. Also the whole first season takes place over a period of 2 years, so seeing the day by day would have been boring.  The pacing of the second season is also good for the time period that that arc took place which was approximately a week. As for the incest issue, the relationship between Kirito and Sugu isn't that. Incest as you all know implies a sexual relationship between two family members, but there is none of that going on between those two. It is simply shown as Sugu having a crush on her cousin and nothing other than that is implied. That aside I'd like to finish by mentioning that I personally believe that this anime will continue to endeavor and survive the years to become a classic anime that defines this decade and it's genre.",4.5
sword-art-online,"Sword Art Online seemed really cool to me in the beginning. I loved the art style, the animation was gorgeous, and the music really fit the show. For the first five or six episodes I was really into it, eagerly awaiting each new release at the end of the week. It was an intense show with an interesting premise that I enjoyed watching. I didn't really care much for the main two characters (Asuna and Kirito), but in the end it didn't matter because the rest of the show and characters were enough to hold me over.However, about the time the show started focusing more on the relationship between Kirito and Asuna, the show started to take a turn for the worse. By the end of the first half of the anime, Asuna went from a strong, capable leader to a whiny, dependent girl who could barely take care of herself. When Kirito was going to go off to fight a boss without her, she clung desperately to him, whining about how if he died she'd kill herself, and blah blah blah. Way to destroy her character completely, guys.Kirito went from somewhat interesting to... well, somewhat interesting, I guess. He barely changed throughout the show. Little character development and a bland personality a good character does not make. But the real breaking point for me was episode 14. The show then proceeds to completely break all its pre-established rules (for no reason, might I add. Kirito is killed, yet somehow wills himself back to life to beat the final boss? I don't think so. Asuna magically overcomes paralysis to save Kirito from dying, with absolutely no explanation? Ugh.). After that, the show just isn't worth watching. The plot for the second half of the show is generic and mediocre at best, and with characters you can't even really like, there's little worth coming back for. Asuna does nothing but mope and cry, Kirito spends half his time messing around and the other half of it like, ""I MUST SAVE ASUNA!!!1!11!"" so there's never any real sense of urgency. Sugu is a decent character, but the show does nothing but slap her around every episode and it's really hard to watch.Overall, I would not recommend this show to anyone. It started out so good but ultimately failed to live up to the hype.",3
sword-art-online,"This anime is practically the best and most entertaining anime that thousands or maybe millions of people are enjoying each time a new episode is out and funny moments happening. Also i have to say the romance part is practically the ""second"" best part about this anime so far (Action is #1). if this is an on-going anime (EXTREMELY HOPING IT IS!) then many people will be extremely happy (MOSTLY ME OF COURSE!!   ^'O'^).",3
sword-art-online,"Looking back on it, Sword Art Online was the only decent show to come out of Summer 2012. The premise is pretty base and the writing is sub-par, yet it has some good execution with a well done score from Yuki Kajiura and pretty good animation. After episode 14 though, where the Aincrad arc ends and the Alfheim arc begins, the series completely jumps the shark and the writing becomes ridiculous. The first 14 episodes are ok, but after that point the rest of the series just gets dumb. Not to mention the fanbase of this show is just as annoying as Narutards. Overall, this series isn't really worth watching.For a more in depth review of this series, watch Digibro's video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uON7ANNOi4",5

sword-art-online,"Ok, yes this show has 101 problems in terms of the plot, and the story does go a bit downhill in the second half, but none of this really bothered me.

A second season would not go amiss.",3
sword-art-online,"The first half of SAO was pretty good. Was a bit disappointed that so many character just got dropped and forgotten after one episode and I definitely had a problem with the pacing of the show. That said though, the show still held pretty nicely, what with the animation and a few gem episodes with interesting concepts, and i enjoyed myself a very good amount.Then the second half happened.. just. it just was not gooood",4
sword-art-online,"To be completely truthful i went in this anime wary due to the controversy surrounding this show. I was surprised to end up liking it with it's awesome battles and good writing. I mean i'd notice the characters being a little flat but it is a classic shouen type anime so not that big of a problem. I really started to like this anime, it wasn't masterpiece material like Gankutsuo or Code Geass but it was up there with the likes of Black Butler and Ouran. Then came the second story arc that just plainly failed to deliver. I mean i know it wouldn't be true to the its roots but if it ended at episode 14 it would have been amazing. Though this aside it is a decent anime that deserves to be watched.",4
sword-art-online,"I spent the majority of this series with my mouth agape, my butt at the edge of my seat, and my eyes filled to the brim with tears. I'm usually very critical about action series that seemingly plug a romantic storyline in so it has unisex appeal, but every relationship and character interaction in SAO was as natural as reality itself. Not a single part of this series seemed repetitive, over done, or contrived. I can confidently say that out of all series I've seen up until now, Sword Art Online is the closest to absolute perfection. Brava!",4.5
sword-art-online,"Sword Art Online had been named anime of 2012 by multiple review sites including this site. Is it? Well, let's just say that 2012 isn't the best year of animes.Plot: 7/10Too low for you? The plot of SAO is about thousands of players being trapped in a virtual reality mmorpg. The only way out is for someone to clear the game. With 14 episodes for the first story arc of the anime, it felt rushed. Audiences weren't given the time to explored every side of Aincrad (the floating city in SAO). Lots of in-game mechanics aren't really explained. But lets look at the good side, SAO's plot is still worth the watch. People in the game don't have any reason to finish it other than to live. A fight for your life. There are episodes featuring how the game changes people. But people exploding into pixels make deaths less dramatic.Characters: 7/10The anime is all about Kirito and Asuna. And no one else. The weakest point of the anime is its poor minor characters. They get 1 episode and you never really get to see them much. This makes the world of SAO feel small. Kirito is a really cool guy. Unlike most protagonists, he is a badass from the start, due to being a beta-tester of SAO. He's known to solo bosses. I say again, he's a badass. Asuna is also a powerful player with a much likeable attitude. But I would consider her ""a generic female lead"" since there's nothing really special about her.The romance between the two is a good change of pace. It didn't take them long to confess their feelings and get married (in-game). They aren't shy to show their love for each other. Though sometimes, they talk too mature for their age. ""I want to be with you forever"" and all that stuff.There's really no unique or interesting character hereAnimation: 10/10Animation is flawless here. The fight scenes are amazing. There's nothing one can complain about the animation. It's really goodSummaryAfter watching the first arc of the story, I was disappointed. This anime is extremely overrated and I wouldn't dare call it the best anime I've seen. But it's still worth your time. Though if you're looking for a story with deep and well-developed characters, this ain't the anime for you. Towards the end, the was anime no longer about Kirito and Asuna alone. But I say again, minor characters and villains are as plain as paper here. I hope I didn't shoo you off the anime. I only wanted to tell how I felt with my years of Otakuness. The anime is still one of the best of 2012. Other people may call the story engaging but I've seen what engaging truly means.Marked: Overrated",4.5
sword-art-online,"Sword Art Online is a very good Anime. The Characters are amazing and totally believable. I thought that the way the story moved was a bit fast in the First story arc, because  i would of like to see more buildup of the relationship of Asuna and Kirito and more of the life after they were married. And the 2nd arc was Just as good as the first one was. All in all a very  good anime and HIGHLY recommend that you watch this one!",4
sword-art-online,"I've been putting off watching this anime in the thought that it will probably be your average RPG anime. They get stuck in this world and to be able to escape, they need to defeat the big boss. Of course in the end they probably survive and defeat the boss as they all do. Happy ending. The end.On second thoughts, scratch that. I know it does sound really cliché and you've probably watched like, 100 other animes like this.Trust me, you couldn't have been more wrong. This is a must see anime that puts you on a roller coaster of emotions. It's not always the whole fight scene but it's more than that. You get comedy from the funny scenes and of course the romance between Kirito and Asuna. You are taken through the tragedies and deaths that Kirito experiences which makes him and his will to live for those people stronger. And the obvious, the fight scenes which are very well presented with the really good graphics and sounds! You feel all those and more! Sometimes I feel like I am him and I'm experiencing what he's experiencing. Much like I am in the game.I would suggest watching it from start to finish in a dark room somewhere eating pop corn and all your favourite foods with the sounds turned up really loud. Now that's the definition of heaven.",5
sword-art-online,"Sword Art Online is really just a story about a very mary-sueish character named Kirito, following his adventure as he gets trapped into an online world. The world of Sword Art Online is rather interesting, and has a plethora of wonderful and unique mechanics that take a back seat to the relationships that Kirito builds with a bunch of random female players, eventually settling on the cliche ""independent women"" Asuna. While it tries to build suspense with the 'if you die in the game you die IRL' this soon grows old due to it's lackluster presentation of the characters grinding to take on the next boss, only to have half of them die in one hit. Had Sword Art Online focused on more than two of it's characters and delved more into it's hastily discarded concepts, it could have proven a real winner.",4
sword-art-online,"Being a man of music, I'm gonna go ahead and give my opinion of some of the music. The opening and ending of season 1 were very cool to watch and had some cool music by Lisa (who did the opening to one of my favorite shows, Fate/Zero). In the show, whoever wrote the music did not lack from creativity so I think the music in general was handled very well. The I feel the same way about the art style. Almost all of my grievances come from season 2.  Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideI personally think the show should've ended after episode 14 when Kirito wakes up. That would've made for a fantastic and non-traditional ending. However, they decided to let the show go on. Season 1 was very good, simple show to watch given that each episode was pretty much self-contained. I really enjoyed the simpleness of it, everything from the kinda cool fight scenes to the romance. But then season 2 came around it's just gradually gotten worse and worse to the point where I'm not sure I want to continue watching it anymore.  Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideThe whole thing with the love interest with brother and ""sister"" is just too weird for me and then almost having tentacle porn happen right in my face did not win any favors with me. I believe there is still hope for this show, but it is slim and fading.For those of you saying that this has the action of Bleach, the intelligence of Death Note, and other stuff like, I humbly disagree. If you want action, go watch Fate/Zero. If you want intelligence and intricacies, go watch Baccano! (yes, it is spelt with the exclamation point). If you want plot twists and good character development, watch Guilty Crown. For those who might be reading and haven't started yet, I encourage you to only watch the first 14 episodes, at least until they have a few more than the current 22 episodes up (I don't know how long this show will last anyways). So pretty much the only reason I'm giving this a 3/5 is because of season 1",2
sword-art-online,"Though I have never read the manga, I will give a review as to my interpretation on the anime.I am thoroughly enjoying the story of our main heroes with a tragic love story, even though love triangles have bothered me very much in the past, at least two of them are in meaningful love. It is also a new take as far as I know of, to have two triangles with the main couple only trying to get to a point were life can continue peacefully for them.I absolutely love the 'baby' of the two lovers and feel that it was brought into the story at an appropriate time and was strange but even the two 'parents' were understandably confused and handled it as such believable actions that understandably make the most sense to them at the time.Everyone whom I know offline and online that have played MMORPGs with me speaks of their time online was real and often times more enjoyable than a real day on auto-pilot and this portrayed the experience accurately from the perspective of someone who has played MMORPGs obsessively as portrayed in the series.",5

sword-art-online,"Since this series hasn't officially ended I cannot properly assess an accurate score or review, however, I will give my first impressions and thoughts on this series. (Up to Episode 20)[Genre & Audience]Sword Art Online (SOA) starts off as an adventure/fantasy based anime. This changes later on though, as the story gears towards a more romantic story. I have to say that the romance really plays a great deal in the overall story (up to what we have seen) and it will probably stay that way. Here and there action sequences are added in order to ""spice"" things up and provide more variety, but in the end, the main focus is romance.  [Plot] Digging beneath the overall plot and romance, we find a very generic and predictable story. There are many scenes that audiences could easily foreshadow and predict, thus making this a very generic anime. The plot is not unique in the way that it is not something we've never seen before. However, this is not entirely a bad thing. Those who really enjoy romance and deep character development will come to love this series. The entire experience of Sword Art Online, is being able to relate with the characters and living through them. Around halfway through the plot, there is an interesting twist that really strengthens the story's focus and characters.[Characters]In the beginning episodes, I found that the character development was not really strong as I felt somewhat cheated when they often introduced 1 or 2 new characters, had them bond way too fast, then killed them off all in 1 episode. This problem was resolved in later episodes, when the anime had finally established its main characters and focus. A definite plus happens near the halfway point of the series when the character development really starts to solidify and entrance the emotions of its viewers. As I am a hopeless romantic, I found myself enchanted by the character dialogue and many of the settings where they took place. I felt like I could somewhat relate to some of the characters and the hardships they were going through (not to mention the well put together romantic episodes). Midway through the series is also when an unexpected twist changes the story heavily and throws its audience off balance (it mind boggled me). This is where the anime starts to truly shine in its use of character development. It is that point where the main character is faced with a difficult dilemma but refuses to give up. The hardships that he endures sparked empathy in me that brought me to tears.  [Art & Animation] The art itself is gorgeous, and the fight scenes are rather well put together. There is a lot of detail put into the animation which brings the story to life. Although the story line is considered a bit generic and predictable, the environment and settings are definitely not. The farther I got into the series, the farther I felt myself trapped in this world of beauty. Constant happiness and freedom seems to linger around the game world, and it gives one a sense of relief and liberation. It begs the question to its viewers: whether a happy dream is better than a dull reality?[Conclusion & Personal Thoughts]I definitely had a lot of fun with this series with its top notch characters and innovative setting and design. Even though I've been stressing how the story is ""very predictable"" I still love this anime to pieces. I find myself very attached to the main characters and often find myself having the same emotional reactions as them in certain scenes. Thus when the sudden twist happened, I felt my heart shattering to pieces; I had never felt so vulnerable, and definitely not from an anime. Not only does this anime have a great love story to tell, it really brings out the emotions of the audience. I definitely recommend it to any adventurers out there, fond of a basic generic hero, and a loving for a sweet, and charming love story! I just can't wait to see how the story turns out!",2
sword-art-online,"Plot was great at first. From watching the first episode I really saw potential in this show and really thought it would be a very promising adaption series, unfortunately that impression didn't stand for very long. Episode by episode it became really hard to grasp the original plot in this series, The unnecessary fillers, fan service, and unbelievably fast phase of it all left me with a headache every time. Really though, screw all the action, lets make Asuna and Kirito play Husband and Wife for the next three episodes.(: The main characters identify perfection. Kirito is a beater whose masculinity cannot be touched by anyone mortal, every single girl digs him -- yes, even his own cousin, and also gets a special ability not given to any other player because he is just that great.  Asuna is a  Babe with the cooking skills of a housewife, money, and beauty, making Kirito look even more of a badass than he's already set out to be. So perf, you guys. (: Side characters barely got enough showtime and may never come up in the series again, sad to say. For the Pros though... the animation is great, and the music was highly enjoyable. Overall, this show gets a  3 from my perspective. I know I skipped a few things in this review, but I wanted to make this short and almost brief. This anime could have been so, SO much more, but unfortunately fell a victim of the glamorization of fan-service that is the anime industry today. Hell, It would have been my favorite show of all time if it wasn't for all this.",3
sword-art-online,"If you loved .hack you're going to love Sword Art Online. The concept of, ""you die in the game you die in real life"" has never been done well, and SAO has done it justice. The Raw emotion and intensity displayed by the characters is amazing, and the episodes always leave you wanting to watch more, after watching just one episode I was hooked and could not stop, I literally sat down and watched all 17 current episodes in one day. Don't listen to the random hater reviews, some people just can't grasp great quality anime when it is given to them.",3
sword-art-online,"I'm saying this right now SAO is without a doubt my favourite show this year and that includes all forms of media not just anime. Story The story is well paced, and told through the eyes of Kirito a player in the world of Sword Art Online known as a beater a gamer who was lucky enough to be part of the 1000 beta players and thus knows all the secrets and best quests, Kirito is at first a Solo player who helps the front line when the reach a powerful level boss. The story is just wonderful! it's engrossing and keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering what will happen next. Characters What can i say about the characters in SAO? They are amazing well written and wonderful. You want them to succeed and you grow to love each one individual. Conclusion SAO is best show I've watched this year and the best Anime i've watched in a long long time, I look forward too a new episode every week and it has yet too disappoint me, new comers may find the first few episodes slow but once you get through those i think it becomes a show that will live in your mind days after your done with each episode.",3
sword-art-online,Best show I have seen in a very long time. At first i thought it was going to be like the .hack series but wow this show exceeded my expectations. The characters are well rounded so it feels like you know then even though we know very little about them. Asuna and Kiritos relationship is perfect the two are made for each other the relationship in the anime feels a little rushed and forced compared to the light novels but does not affect the show in anyway. Any fan of MMOs well feel at home with the setting of this show it puts a great detail into what a game would look and feel like. Overall I must say that this is now one of my top 3 must watch,4.5
sword-art-online,"I love romance anime, I also enjoy anime filled with action. That being said SAO manages to balance both wonderfully where most focus on one or the other.The romance side of SAO is very refreshing, as opposed to most anime where the entire show is based of trying to understand what the relationship is, SAO has no misunderstandings about Kirito's and Asuna's love for one another. Instead it focuses on the obstacles they must overcome to stay together which to me is is more romantic in context.Overall I feel it is the best new show of the season and is a definite must see.",4.5
sword-art-online,"It's been a few years since I've been so absorbed into a series, and Sword Art Online really has reeled me in something shocking. From the seamless animation to the beautiful landscapes, nail biting fight scenes to the unforgettable characters, this series really has the lot. Sure, it has a few flaws and annoying instances (I'll get to those later), but when you're given a packages as incredible as this, those annoyances will be forgotten before you even think about questioning it.Sword Art Online (SAO) is set in a breathtaking cyber world that is created as a revolutionary MMO where players are fully immersed by means of a helmet that transmits all their senses and nerve signals to the game. On launch day, things quickly take a sinister turn when the game creator tells players that they are stuck in the game and death ingame would be permanent, both ingame and in real life. Their only salvation is to make it through all 100 floors of the tower, by which they would complete the game and they would be set free. The story mainly follows the relationship between Kirito, a shy and slightly reclusive boy, and Asuna, a determined and strong willed girl who are brought closer throughout the show.Setting/storyline: 9.5/10As an avid gamer myself, I dream of a time when fully integrated gameplay is introduced, and this gets my hopes up even more. The ultimate escapism to this vibrant and dynamic world just makes me wish I was there, even if it is just to sit on a hill watching the sun set. The contrast between this an the ominous corridors of the tower really work well to show two very different and potentially dangerous sides to this utopia. The storyline also paces itself very well, not feeling rushed and hurried, but still fast enough not to leave you feeling bored. There are some genuinely surprising twists in the story that are always a welcome addition. I feel perhaps they could have delved a little deeper, but SAO does a good job showing human psychology when put under strain by fear of death, opportunities for power and wealth and freedom to make your own decisions without the fear of the consequences. More times than I am comfortable to admit, I felt tears welling up at the more emotional scenes, and they sure do throw them in quite often and understandably a good handful nearer the end. ******POSSIBLE SPOILER******Having watched up to episode 15, I am majorly impressed that they have gone on to show the aftermath of the main story. Too often, the aftermath is overlooked and is just something that they almost feel obliged to put in just to leave us viewers satisfied that everything did turn out ok, the boy did get the girl and they lived happily ever after. But I feel that the transition from a magical, almost idealistic world, to the harsh realities and politics of society can be just as interesting, if not more, than the main plot. So far so good, fingers crossed!Also, when a hand gets cut off and that said hand disappears and that character is missing a hand for a good while, said hand should not grow back. I was expecting that to be an ironic twist so soon after he revealed his special ability!******END OF SPOILERS*******Characters: 9.5/10And unforgettable cast is paramount in an unforgettable experience, and SAO does this fantastically. Even more minor characters are given enough time to develop and really make an impression or surprise us. The main protagonist suffers from your usual cliches, being overly depressed, completely oblivious to most girls feelings and self loathing, but thankfully before these start becoming a major annoyance, he turns into a complete utter BADASS. Kirito is, for the most part, a lone wolf that is equally feared, respected and hated for his incredible skills and these skills play a major part in a lot of SAO's awesome fight scenes.I'm not usually a fan of straight up romance, preferring rather to choose between a group of love interests, but Kirito's and Asuna's relationship is one of the best I've ever seen. Sure, there is your usual dilly dallying around the topic for a while, but once it properly blossoms, their selfless love for each other really is quite touching and beautiful. I genuinely felt attached to many of the characters in SAO, and really felt emotional when some of them inevitably died/disappeared. Artwork/animation:10/10Epic fights, breathtaking landscapes, great clothing/weapon design and an incredibly attractive cast. What else can you ask for?Overall: 9.7/10SAO is easily making it to my favorite animes of all time. Nothings perfect, but this sure does put up a fair fight. An excellently polished piece of work with a great story and cast all wrapped up in a beautiful world. If this continues at the standard it has kept up throughout, I'll be a happy man.(Also, Sachi. Goddammit Sachi!)",3
sword-art-online,"When I saw the cover art for SAO I was a bit excited first as it seemed to be game related and as I was watching this I was hooked from the start. The storyline is breathtaking even for a ""light novel"" I really wish to see this kind of future right now while I'm still young and to experience this is almost every gamers' dream to be able to play the game your way not by the buttons programmed to attack or defend but your own ""Initial Input"" as Kirito states. I have been researching this kind of gameplay the dream is possible but it would require that more research would have to be put into studying on how to incorporate the brain to machines as ""NerveGear"" Shows us. Most people may not wish for a life and death situation like this but this kind of experience may be how most gamers may want to die, ""Playing"". In the end for the first season of SAO I give this a perfect 5 star and I know it is with its story, wonderful music, the little romance and a little fan service doesn't hurt but I really enjoy the story as this may inspire more minds like myself who would want to stop playing the games of this era and continue towards this future so that while we are still young, may enjoy this to the best of our ability.I am currently undergoing research into Virtual Reality and as much progress into gaming has grown we have yet to focus on the brain sure the technology we have is quite enough to make it but we need to create a language that is compatible with the brain's vast amount of electrical pulses. Further more later",5
sword-art-online,"Sword Art Online or SAO is a great story about a boy named Kirito who buys this virtual reality game that just came out, but a really messed up twist of fait has him as well as the 14,000 or so other people who logged into the game trapped inside the world of SAO. Now stuck in a life or death battle its either clear the game and send everyone back to the real world or die trying with the help of Asuna and some other friends, Everyone just might get to see the real world again or will it be....GAME OVERWith great art and animation Sword Art Online is a great anime you should really watch. The fact that this could really happen just might make you rethink buying a virtual reality game in the future (just sayin)",3
sword-art-online,"This is an amazing show that really appeals to the MMORPG players out there. It is well thought out with a fantastic story. It's filled with romance, suspense, comedy, action, and all within the context being a MMORPG. The main characters are not all the same and each have their own personalities, psychological obstacles, preferences, and abilities. The show really shines in the fact it has RPG references throughout thus grounding the anime and characters to facts, knowledge, and lore that even casual gamers can understand. That is why I give it a 5/5 and cannot wait to see where season 2 is heading.",5
sword-art-online,"This anime has a delectable taste to it for gamers and for people who love the whole action drama type of animes.  this anime most people say, that the game should become real. they would get rich off of this game if it were to become a game. thats how good the anime is. its so good it leaves u wanting 2nds, 3rds and 4ths of this dinner and dessert.. Sword art online has a great aura around it.. i give sword art online 5 stars out of 5",5
sword-art-online,"Just by the name of the anime i thought it was going to be about learning how to draw swords or something. Then i found out it was a anime, the cover looked good so i watched it. If you are into suspense,love story,action,and comedy (only a little)  then this is a anime for you. Its just plan out AMAZING. It will make you cry,and jump for joy and even make you want to go into the anime and punch some of those (female dogs). Well if you LOVE anime with a passion you'll fan girl a lot then.Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideI CANT WAIT FOR THE THE 2nd SEASON (yes there will be a 2nd season)",5
sword-art-online,"I'll start my review by saying this is one the greatest anime I have ever seen, and I don't say that very often ^^It can be hard to find and series that combines so neatly the genres of romance, action, and fantasy these days, but Sword Art Online manages to do the task almost perfectly, maybe one of the best points of this anime is how nicely the characters ( not only the main ones) are built ( and I m not talking about character development, that's is rather lacking here ) most people can relate to at least two of them and you can almost feel what they are feeling, the drama and action are smart, very entertaining  and intense, but I think that the major aspect here is the romance, I could only compare to Bokura Ga Ita's, and that's really ( besides all the rest ) why I LOVE this anime so much, YOU CAN'T MISS IT :)!!(I did't mention the bad points because I feel they are overshadowed by the positive facts of it)",2
sword-art-online,"After watching 3 episodes of Sword Art Online (SAO) I finally decided to make a review for it.This anime draws you into the messy world of MMOs. It is impressive that each episode makes the anime realistic compared to MMOs being played right now. When a person plays MMO, the game won't stop every player who's been there way before you just to notify that YOU are gonna be amazing or be the strongest person in the server. People don't stand out in the game just by standing there and not even introducing yourself to anyone (for the guy who reviewed this anime poorly... you need to get real and not expect the most cliche types of anime where the player is just too damn strong compared to everyone)If you start watching this anime, the thing that might bother you the most is the big time leaps in each episode. This is actually something that makes the anime better and more realistic. If you play MMO, most of the times you just grind or do boring quests daily. Each episode shows you the more interesting parts of an MMO and also a story that shows the characteristics of the protagonist and how he is shaped into another person after meeting people during the gameThis anime is really good and playing an MMO gives more appeal to this show because of the nostalgic system, begginer's stage, etc. This series is something worth watching that wont actually let you down in each episode (well of course, I'm only saying this to the current episodes)",3
sword-art-online,"First things first-Read the Light Novel, it is amazing.Secondly, right off the bat, the plot of SAO had me hooked. I cannot even count the numerous times I dream't of being in a VRMMORPG (Virtual Reality Massive Multiplayer Role-Playing Game) it would certainly be the end of my life-But at the same time create a entirely different one.Although the situation these characters have to endure would not to be exactly preferable..If you have ever played a MMO, you'll find yourself feeling the bitter sweet nostalgic memories of your past game time. You'll be able to relate to almost everything and with that connect to the world almost instantly.If you haven't played an MMO.. well, shucks you really aught to.That is about all I'll say for now. Perhaps i'll write another review when the show is finished so I squeal and blubber about it like a tiny little fan girl. Till then my friends.Trah-la-la.",5
sword-art-online,"Sword Art Online is an anime based off of a series of Light Novels by the same author who wrote the Light Novels for Accel World.  Taking place in a world where the inhabitants are trapped within a game by the game's creator and where death within the game becomes death in reality, the citizens of the world must fight through the 100 floors of the world in order to log out.Thus far, the quality of the art and sound seems fairly typical.  Thus, what brings this series to life is the story.   Many will liken this to .hack and in many ways, there are similarities, but there are also subtle differences even within those.  As examples:Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hide all players trapped in the world and unable to log out similar to what happens in GU..  However, unlike GU where dying would only make you fall into a coma, in SAO you actually die.  Like in .hack, there are PKs and people aiming to stop them; however, unlike .hack, PKing and stopping PKs is a matter of life and death where failure to stop the PKs will literally result in countless deaths..However, the story is not about the similarities and while .hack focuses much more on certain aspects such as a mysterious being with great powers, Sword Art Online is much more focused on the relationships between the players and a few major battles.  The key basis behind the story of Sword Art Online is that death is final.  How people resolve that becomes a major and important part of the story.Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hidePretty much anything can kill you.  Other players, people outside trying to remove the gear from you, monsters, and there is even a story arc revolving around PKs managing to circumvent the towns' anti-pk protection.But perhaps this review is a little unfair.  Nothing could possibly compare to actually watching it yourself.  Watch the anime for an episode or two.  Maybe even pick up the manga or light novel.  I'd recommend checking out at least the first few episodes/chapters before deciding.   This series is more than worth the time.",4.5
sword-art-online,"I would rate the SAO arc with 5 stars and the ALO arc with 3 stars if I could. However, this is a review for the overall anime. The good: 1. Excellent soundtrack and animation. The show has a great aesthetic. 2. Strong, interesting, and engaging premise for the story. 3. Fun and interesting characters. The antagonists do a great job. The not-so-good: 1. ""Harem"" Elements: The godly Kirito is loved by all females. This honestly doesn't add to the show, and arguably takes away from it. Given that this show also takes place in an MMO, SAO can be perceived as a ""teenager's fantasy"" in more ways than one. 2. Asuna's personality does a 180: She's introduced as being strong and independent, but becomes dependent and submissive once she falls in love with Kirito. 3. Suguha's  Incestual Desires: I'll call it incest because cousin-cousin relationships are considered as such in several cultures, and because Kirito and Suguha were raised as siblings and he always considered her as such. It's bad because it attempts to add romantic elements to the ALO arc despite the fact that (i) Kirito already has Asuna and (ii) the ultimate goal of the arc is to save Asuna from a disgusting pervert. This element of the show almost contradicts everything around it. 4. Underwhelming Plot, Gives into Romance: This anime had a great premise for a captivating action and adventure story. However, it almost fails to meet such expectations by putting a large emphasis on romance and fanservice. This show would have been more powerful if it maintained a focused theme. An issue that I have with this show is that it's like a ""stealth romance."" It puts a larger emphasis on romance than on action, but the given genres do not reflect such. Kirito doesn't look good as a ""player"" or a ""manwhore"" like Narukami from Persona 4 the Animation, in which the characters can actually joke about it. The ALO arc, despite its great fight scenes, includes more fanservice and romance than the SAO arc. Ironic considering how Asuna was locked away.",4.5
sword-art-online,"I started watching SAO without reading the short story or manga, and I got into it right away from the first episode. The concept is really interesting, the artwork was AMAZING. But some parts of the show, I would get confused because:1) there's plotholes2) something is not explained, and you'd have to know the original story or read the comments to understand3) it's really ... unbelievable at partsOverall, if you want to get into it, read the short story first then come to appreciate the anime for it's amazing artwork.",5
sword-art-online,"Honestly, this anime is my favorite ever (not saying much though because I'm kinda new to anime).  I know that if you look at it critically, it's actually not that good, but in terms of pure enjoyment, it's at the top of my list.  I loved all the action and fights that they put in.  All the fights were excellently executed and had amazing art.  The romance is really what made me enjoy it so much (I'm kinda a sap for romance, even cheesy stuff like this ^.^).  Anyways, great anime.",5
sword-art-online,"I have to say SAO is the best anime i have seen in a long time and i mean it. It blew my standards away, now when i see another show on i roll my eyes because i know that there nowhere near what u have accomplished with SAO. But i do hope however that u can go more in-depth this go round like how the story is in what u wrote make the series longer than 25 episodes because u could easily make it a 50-100 episode series and do fine i mean there is enough info to do that also maybe come back around and fill in some stuff with Aincrad and in Alfheim. Also if and when u do it maybe consider making a longer series with Gun Gale and UnderWorld. Hope my advice is good and is not takin bad in any way shape or form only giving u my 2 cents in hope of a SEASON 3 and 4 and on and on if u know what i mean, if u like my ideas please use them all i ask in return is for 1 word to be posted and that is a YES then i will know and be super happy =D",3
naruto-shippuden,"This anime has great canon. Since it is based on the manga, the story in itself is great. HOWEVER, most of this anime is filler. When you think you're getting to a climax in a storyline... you get 15 filler episodes. EVERY. DAMN. SEASON. The manga is now over. THEY CAN BRING THE SHOW TO A CONCLUSION. They won't however. Instead, they greatly degrade the quality of a once good anime with almost completely unwatchable filler storylines. In fact, there is soo much filler, after waiting month after month after month for the actual canon (the reason for this anime), I've completely withdrawn from the story to the point where I simply don't care and have to rewatch episodes from 3 months ago to remember wtf is going on. The anime company destroyed what could have been the greatest anime in existence. Like spray painting a stickman body on the Mona Lisa to make it a larger picture. Empty, useless, boring episodes usually follow a good canon episode and after almost a decade of this pattern I must say, read the manga instead. It is way better and won't disappoint since (again) the story really is one of the best. I'm sad to see Naruto end, but happy as well, since the longer fillers continue (even at the end), the more of a ""milking the cow"" scenario this becomes.",4.5
naruto-shippuden,"I started watching Naruto back in 2003.I'm now in 2014 and still watching! I grew up on it and it really does teach great values in it's story and the character development. Naruto single handedly brought me into all the other anime, such as Bleach, Death Note, InuYasha, etc. The story is truly original and so in depth it'll surprise you how far it goes. Naruto turns from punk to protector of his village throughout the years this show has been going on. This anime has it all: Romance, Action (OF COURSE), Great fighting scenes too, music is top notch and so are the voice overs. It's truly been an amazing ride and I will definitely miss it when it's gone, but it's gotta end sometime. To anyone new to this series: Get into it ASAP, you won't regret it!",3
naruto-shippuden,"If you have never read this Manga or watched this Anime i recommend you stop reading reviews and get to watching because you are definitely missing out.Ive been watching Naruto since i was 8. As i kid i saw it as more of a humorous funny anime but as i got older and Shippuden came out i got to experience the depth of the Naruto Mange and Anime. Naruto Shippuden puts all the pieces together of every story line so well it keeps you in, as i did me....i would say until it ended (Chapter 700 came out 2 weeks ago) But Naruto:The last is said to come to theaters in Japan on 12/6/14 and im beyond excited about that. Even after Naruto:The last comes out i will always come back to re-read and re-watch Naruto and Naruto shippuden, I am a mother now and introduced my daughter to the series as soon as she started paying attention to the content in TV shows. We watch it everynight together. And when shes old enough to read ill be handing down my Naruto and Naruto Shippuden Manga to her to enjoy as i did. Naruto and Naruto Shippuden has been a huge part of most of my life and i just cant see myself walking away probably ever.",5
naruto-shippuden,"Usually, the companies that make the show can't always follow the storyline, sometimes the author hasn't come up with the rest of the main plot, so they usually put in filler. Filler will almost always be considered bad. In other major  they could have entire arcs for the filler, but it would still be interesting. Naruto shippuden's filler IS THE OLD NARUTO EPISODES PUT INTO A REVIEW, they are things we have already seen nothing is original, and like it or not, all large anime have filler, the difference between a good and a great anime is how well the filler is managed",4.5
naruto-shippuden,"Although the series has not completely ended yet, I did love the series from the beginning. The character development was brilliant. And the plot was very smooth... until fillers started to corrupt the social structure of this series. I just wished the fillers were limited to only one for every 50 episodes, but that may be but a fairy tale. The plot itself is very unique. Same thing goes with the fighting styles, which are something you may have never seen before in any other anime. I recommend watching from the very beginning, but i shall warn you that there will be an excessive number of fillers. So much that you might give up on the whole series altogether.",4.5
naruto-shippuden,"Naruto has it all. It is an epic story of a hero in the making. Every character is carefully woven to the most minute trait. They all feel very real, most of them are far from being stereotyped. Whether they are antagonists or supporting characters, you will find out why they became  the way they are.Conflicts do not arise because some characters are intrinsically good or bad, but because everyone believes in a different path to cope with pain and suffering.This show explores every single aspect of human existence. There is revenge, betrayal, solitude, love, friendship, loss, deceit, regret, sacrifice, generosity, misunderstandings, existentialist and morality issues. As big of a fan as I am of Greek tragedies, Naruto exceeds in complexity and poignance the classics. It is a true masterpiece.It is also really funny, my favorite comedic relief characters are in this show. It's so well balanced, it does not cease to impress me. The battles are exciting, creative, smart! You will be astounded and entertained.If you do not like Naruto, I will judge you as either superficial or impatient. It is not for everyone to watch almost 600 episodes of an anime (because yes, there is no way you will be invested in Shippuden without watching the first 135 episodes of the original Naruto). But if you do stick around for more than 20 episodes, your life will be changed.(This review has been written without taking filler episodes into consideration. Some are really funny, but most have repetitive messages. Feel free to skip those. Or, if you like the characters, enjoy them as I do, as a chance to get to know your favorite people a little better)",4.5
naruto-shippuden,"My title pretty much sums it up the stars but I'll go with some extra points.The anime overall is very good. Plenty of action and character development, ridiculous and awesome fights/powers. The problem is the stupid amount of fillers. If you are binge watching then you probably won't notice, but once you catch up you will be at a point like me where the past 3-4 months have been pure fillers that interrupted the middle of a damn war, even though there is already plenty of written content for them to make REAL episodes.",4.5
naruto-shippuden,"Naruto is one of the single greatest shows I have ever had the pleasure to stumble across. I have watched Naruto since i was in middle school and am about to graduate with a bachelors degree. In all that time I have never stopped finding inspiration and entertainment in this show. It has single-handedly been responsible for more and deeper critical thinking then many college level classes I have taken. All in all if you are looking for and amazing show that will not only make you laugh, cry, scream, and possible throw shuriken but nourish your soul then welcome home, you have found your fandom at long last.",4.5
naruto-shippuden,"sure, it's been great in the past but now it's just being milked for every last cent it can make. this show is the perfect example of how to make a once good show just a useless piece of trash. if you were to look at a proper episode with story and actually having a conclusion as a 20ft. hallway, then you can only walk one step every season. so in the end you'll get bored of this hallway pretty quick and whats worse is that the people who built it decided to make another 100ft of hallway just to make it longer and for no other real reason.",5
naruto-shippuden,"I actually don't mind most of the ""fillers"" throughout both Naruto series. Since I never read the manga, I can't even tell what's filler and what's not, most of the time. But in this final season of Naruto, the fillers have gotten ridiculous. It's not that they aren't well done, in and of themselves -- they are. It's way that they are blatantly used to put off the conclusion of the climatic battle going on at the end of the main story arc that is so frustrating. I haven't calculated the exact numbers, but I feel like the ratio of filler to main story screen time has skyrocketed -- maybe 4 to 1. It has reached a point now, where the meager rationing of main story content has begun to detract from my enjoyment of it, even when it does appear. If you're reading this because you haven't started the series yet, then you might be ok to start watching it now, and by the time you get caught up, the series might be over. Then, you could just skip the last season fillers, if you wanted to. Maybe not though. It might still be going on.",3
naruto-shippuden,"This used to be an interesting show, I mean it.  But with all the fillers this show has, it really shows how much they are milking this show to make money.  Hell they have had whole seasons that were just filler.  I have stopped watching this show a year ago, I came back to check if they had finally completed this ARC.  Nope still tons of filler episodes with only a couple of cannon episodes.  I'm done with this show.",3
naruto-shippuden,"Naruto Shippuden is a must see anime. I can't even think of what life would be like for me without it. Starting of from where the first season ended, Naruto Shippuden is a fun action packed, and most of all; an easy to fall in love with anime.  It includes all of our favorite characters,  even the snake himself Orochimaru. However Orochimaru isn't the only one naruto will have to face off with, The mysterious Akatsuki, returns and this time meaning business......... The thing about Naruto Shippuden, is that it only gets more exciting!!!!  I hope you enjoy this anime as much as I have!",5
naruto-shippuden,"Studio Pierrot needs to stop this nonsense. I loved Naruto, it was something I watched with passion.  But now I feel they don't care about me as a fan. All they want is the money. Yeah I will eventually watch the ending of Naruto (the year 2017). This endless amount of fillers need to stop. I used to buy all the DVD's. I have lost my interest with Studio Pierrot and will discontinue my Naruto Collection. (No point spending money on garbage)Have a great 2016 of fillers.",5
naruto-shippuden,"When the Naruto Shippuden came out I decided to watch naruto again. And at first it was great i would of given the show 5 stars it seemed to have better pacing and definitely had better fight scenes but there was an issue. It's called Alzheimer's and Naurto Shippuden has it. In the last 3 years (mind you i could go on from the beginning but i dont have the patience to create a fillerless list of episode to watch) I watched maybe 20-30 episodes. I bet you are wondering why? Well to put it bluntly, there are 52 weeks in a year and Lets assume that they air 45 episodes a year due to holidays and whatnot. Thats a whopping 135 episodes. Of that only about 20-30 are actually not filler. (I define filler as a flashback that takes up more than 1/2 the episode or content that was added for the sake of adding it) Recently I have not actually watched the show in the last 15 weeks since not a singe episode has been cannon. The last 15 weeks has been flashbacks to Naruto the original anime. Not even updated or redrawn or digitally remastered. They just took the old episode and threw them back in. But of course there's sometimes a minute of whats going on in the plot, just so you wont forget. But just in case you do forget after they finish the flashbacks they will have a flashback to what just happened about 6-12 months ago where the plot left off. BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE !!! Commonly what happens is after they have a flashback it reminds another character of something that happened that we already know happened and has been flashed back upon over a dozen times. If that wasn't bad enough they LOVE to have a flashback that has a flashback that has a flashback (flashception sound the horn) I don't recommend even picking up this show till it's done in a few more years while they make us wait for unnecessary filler. Or you could just read the Manga since it's done.",1
naruto-shippuden,"Naruto Shippuden is one of the best anime series you will find. Critics will bash this series with so many technicalities, but the truth is that Naruto was an action series, and Naruto Shippuden follows suit. The thing that makes these two series differentiate from other action series is that you generally don't want action series for deep and full characters. Naruto distinguishes itself as a story first and everything else (action, animation, coloring, music, etc.) later. That is what makes Naruto so appealing, because the story is a good and original one, and the main characters are very well developed. Give it a shot, especially if you have already watch the Original series Naruto.",5
naruto-shippuden,"I've completely ran out of tears... for the rest of my life, when the need arises to where I would have to cry... I will be unable to... because of this first day of March, in the year 2014, the day episode 249 of Naruto Shippuden drained me of all my tears. Perfect...Family is always the most important thing one should always believe in, and as I'm close to my own family, this episode as well as all the episode in the series brings me to tears... a sentimental side I get from my mother, and yet... I'm grateful. This episode has been etched into my category of all time favorite episodes for the emotional tug of the heart.",4.5
naruto-shippuden,"This is the show that got me into anime in the first place. I still remember randomly watching the first movie without knowing anything about naruto or animes. I highly recommend watching this show for anyone who still havent. Yea, the show has waay to many fillers, and drags on in those periods, but when they back to the main story, I always get reminded why this is my favorite show of all time :).",4.5
naruto-shippuden,"One of the top three shonnen animes for a reason. I've been invested in this series from the minute it began to the current simulcasts. It draws inspiration from dragonball and HunterxHunter in all the right ways. When Naruto gets serious you get to see some of the most intense action scenes you'll ever experience. The only drawbacks to it are the filler episodes, but watching naruto and the gang catching cats/bugs etc,. or trying to see what is under kakashi's mask is the price fans must pay to have a popular weekly show like this.",1
naruto-shippuden,"This was my gateway show to watching other anime series. This series will always be my favorite anime series. It has everything you want in a series like quick flashy action, emotional rollercoaster of uplifting moments to moments that will make you cry like a baby, and lets not forget a vast storyline with many backstories and extra info about different characters and actions. It also has a huge lineup of characters that your bound to relate to more than one of them. I will say that there is a ton and i mean A TON of fillers in this series, either watch them to get backstories on characters you may like or find a filler guide and skip right through them. If you read the manga your gonna be surprised by how far behind the anime series really is due to fillers and whatnot. Even with that being said, its a must see if you watch any action style anime. BELIEVE IT!!!",1
naruto-shippuden,"Fabulous character devolopment throughout the entire anime. That's something I really love about Naruto, you can really feel what the characters are experiencing in a sense. I thoroughly enjoy hearing all of their tragic pasts, and all of the values that you learn from this show. Bonds are forever. Revenge is never the right path, leading to a never ending cycle of hatred. Never give up on the people who are important to you. The quotes are very inspiring and watching Naruto -reading it as well- has made me a better person.",1
naruto-shippuden,"This anime is just awesome. The plot is about saving the world, bonds, trust, loneliness. Naruto Shippuden is unlike any other anime, also (gasp!) unlike Naruto (the first series). The fun in the character Uzumaki Naruto is 50% gone now, replaced with a more serious and mature teen. The plot is perfect, but sometimes it drags it out, it should be fast paced. FILLERS suck, end of.Overall, I love this anime, definitely my favourite, but not in terms of comedy.",1
naruto-shippuden,"At first, when I was considering writing a review for this series, I thought I would rate it much lower. I used to dislike fillers, they were a pet-peeve for me and many others, I'm sure. However I started to think about all my other favourite stories and how sad I was that I couldn't get an in-depth look into the characters, their thoughts, and feelings towards one another. It was then that I realised that is what the fillers of this series does. It gives you a chance to see something rarely seen outside of the actual plot and for that I am most grateful! The Naruto series is by far the best storyline I have ever had the privilege of reading and watching.A major Kudos to all those involved in making this series, you've created a true masterpiece that will undoubtedly last throughout the ages.<3",2

Those were good days where there wasn't any long marathons of fillers.Mark my words. If NARUTO SHIPPUDEN: Ultimate Ninja STORM 4™ Comes out before the series finale does, I will keep this review a one star. Because  UNS4 has a story mode that will end the series like the manga did. I could only imagine the sheer amount of shame if that happens.EDIT: THE GAME. CAME OUT BEFORE. NARUTO SHIPPUDEN COULD END IT'S STORY.WHAT.THEHELL.",5
naruto-shippuden,"All though I really am a big Naruto Fan, there is now way around the many infamous fillers in this anime. The manga has already ended the series. The developers are pretty much milking the series now for money, just like how Nintendo milks Mario Kart. This anime COULD have been better if the fillers just DID NOT EVEN EXIST! GEEZ 95% percent of the war in this anime i STUPID FILLER! Just read the manga! So much better.",5
naruto-shippuden,"I've watched Naruto every since I was a kid and I can say this show successfully created an amazing story and I'm so upset that it has come to an end (not even a good ending). However, the amount of random and unnecessary fillers they put in the show would drive a person crazy. This is one of the main reasons why I gave this 3 stars as well as the reason why I stopped watching the anime and started reading the manga.",4.5
naruto-shippuden,Almost the greatest anime ever was entirely destroyed by....FILLER! It gets 3 stars for almost getting me to watch the whole thing. The horrible fillers were not just boring and destracting. They are downright DEPRESSING. I used to watch this show years ago with my infant son. We bonded over Naruto and now the show is so terrible I literally feel like crying when I think about what they did to it...,4.5
naruto-shippuden,"Honesty Naruto should have been animated by a different company in my opinion. The 3 star rating is only for the anime not the manga. The manga is FIVE STAR WORTHY. They are milking the series too much with over 400fillers. If you are new to naruto I would recommend to find a site that allows you find all the fillers and skip them. Because if you do it's great. But for old fans like me, waiting weekly for fillers to end is pain killing.",5
naruto-shippuden,"this used to be my favourite anime. A year ago I would have given this show a 8.5 out of 10. Unfortunately I am not as passionate about this anime now. First of all this show is about 50% filler and none of it furthers the story in any way. These are usually just garbage filler episodes because the Naruto franchise is being milked. Here I have included a link to a website that tells you all the filler episodes so you can skip them, trust me your not missing a thing. http://www.animefillerlist.com/shows/naruto-shippuden . Okay so the next problem is with the actual episodes that we have to wait so long to get. This anime always starts with an extremely long recap of the last episode, leaving 16 minutes for the show. Then 8 or 9 minutes of the episode are filled with flashbacks from 2 or 3 episodes ago. So on top of waiting for sometimes month to get a canon episode we only get 8 minutes of good content. Next we have the fights. Honestly I could wait for these episodes to come out if I knew there was going to be fast paced, action packed fights but this show is clearly lacking this. The fights are slow and dragged out for to long. There are always flashbacks and talking during the fight and its usually very slow. My final problem with this show is Sakura. I hate her she is a freaking b***h, ill leave it at that. Although this show has so many problems I still love it and hold It close to me. There are way better anime out there though if you like action I suggest Hunterxhunter one of the best action anime with insane fights and you can watch it here on crunchyroll or onepunchman.",5

naruto-shippuden,"A lot of people already know the story, the people who read the manga, and its very annoying for this series to be dragged this much. I know that you want to earn money, but damn. At least release actual story and not this bullcrap. Don't get me wrong, I liked the NAruto series since the first episode came out. But this is just freaking annoying and stupid. As they say, "" You either die a great show, or live long to annoy the hell out of people"" PEACE",5
naruto-shippuden,been watching this anime from the beginning and I have to say I'm getting annoyed with the show getting side tracked and getting away from the story of the here and now. if they want all that extra stuff giving a back story to the characters then they should start with the back story before the season started. It's as annoying as Dragon Ball Z taking a whole episode or 2 for Goku to throw one punch only to have it be deflected like a ping pong ball,5
naruto-shippuden,"If it's ever a progressing episode, then yeah, 5 stars. But due to the fact that 95% of the episodes are fillers, 1 star for sure. Series not good enough to be worth the wasted years worth of fillers. Whole series summed up: friendship, filler, filler, filler, filler, friendship, filler, filler, filler, filler, filler, all characters useless except one, filler, filler, more fillers about useless characters, filler, friendship, the end... thanks for watching 500 episodes of a show that could've been completed from start to finish in 50  episodes. Also, terrible animation quality except in 1/100 episodes.",5
naruto-shippuden,"The start of Naruto and Naruto Ship was amazing, brilliant, fast, upbeat and very quirky at times. You come to love the characters and have favorites. I watched this every week and got up to date with it all. I feel now its loosing its edge and the creator is enjoying the money poring from it. Its got to a stage were i have completely stopped watching this show sadly due to the very unnecessary fillers. I would suggest watching this when its completely finished (if it will ever end) I had a slight fear that its turning into 'A Bleach fiasco' Which we all knew also died. I cant understand why its actually still on the top of the list when its producer is creating SO much hatred with the amount of pointless side stories/back stories/ repeats of stories. Its getting super silly. Just end the war already, your ruining it. Other than that id suggest to watch it if your ok to watch the fillers, its if you have the patience of getting 5 weeks of fillers every other month. Although Enjoy!",5
naruto-shippuden,"I have been watching Naruto since many many years and always felt good to watch a good episode. Bleach also had its fair share of fillers but some of them were actually nice but they decided to finish the anime. The makers of this anime are trying to make money on the expense of heavy viewer dissatisfaction. I mean what is the point. I am growing to hate an anime which was once a favorite. If the anime creators have any sense of understanding, they should get on with the story line, end this story and make a new story with Naruto or Sasuke aiming for the Hokage role. That way it would not be called fillers anymore and fans will still continue watch their favorite show.",5
naruto-shippuden,"Naruto, excellent. The plot from the beginning of the original series to the end of the canon story (manga) is excellent. Problem is though, someone must not be earning enough money off the show, and decided to drag it out a few more years with filler. Most people can deal with fillers, but an unnecessary filler being chucked in, in the middle of the most important battle (debatable) in the entire series, with no queue other than 'oh, do you remember that time?'. This review is difficult to do without swearing, so I'll end it with something more sobering: the two chunin exam arcs of Naruto are the best and worst or the show, one begins the show, excellently, one decides to force itself on a beast already passing and make us all watch.",5
naruto-shippuden,"If you were to see me on the street, you would probably think that there is no way this guy watches any anime. They, however, are wrong. Many people may be inclined to say that anime is childish and made for little kids. However, Naruto is so much more than that. It is a beautiful story of a kid who had nothing and fought his way toward his dreams. This is something we can all relate to and is part of the reason why Naruto is loved by so many people. I was shocked to find how much about life I learned through this show and that is something that is important to note. It is true that Naruto has perhaps the best fighting sequences when it gets going but the true gem in this show is the message and the story. The message that no one is born inherently evil but are molded that way due to unfortunate circumstances and although things may seem hopeless at time, we must always have  the Guts To Never Give Up!",5
naruto-shippuden,"I've been watching the show for several years and I still love the Naruto Universe. A few things continue to plague the series, however, in my opinion. Early on it was the massive amount of filler episodes following the Chunin exam. It didn't seem worthwhile to watch it soon after. Exciting events happened following the exam, but things eventually dwindled down.Fast forward to Shippuden, the series revived immensely! However, things have spiraled down into filler after filler and amazing story arch to filler and filler again. I can go away from watching the show for months at a time and when I come back, I just have more fillers to go through and it doesn't seem like much has happened. Though I will continue to watch because the main story archs are simply incredible.That brings me to my other great frustration with the show: the de-powering of central characters and the everyday Jounin ninja. Ninjas will die by the most basic kunai attacks, making the title ""ninja"" seem ""chump-ish."" Characters like Kakashi also seem to become underpowered which I feel is a forced way to make Naruto look better. The balance of power is frustratingly skewed in Naruto's favor seemingly just because the show shares his name. It felt better when Naruto had to really compete for it. When he was gutsy but learning. His current power seems okay, but I hate seeing other supposedly-amazing ninjas look like chumps in order to make him better. It should be the other way around.All in all. I love the show, but wish they'd go back to a much more serious Naruto ninja show. It's best when things are serious, guys like Kakashi continue to impress while Naruto learns and shocks you.",1
naruto-shippuden,"In a comparison between the original series and Shippuden, I feel Shippuden is better. The original story line had merit, however I believe the characters themselves weren't as entertaining.  I also feel like their lines and goals were weak. I didn't watch the original series in Japanese, but in English I wanted to end my life after hearing Naruto say “Believe it” over a 100 times. I feel other than the Naruto (the main character), there wasn't much for character development. It’s a very straight forward and simplistic plot with a few back stories in between. 1st Naruto’s goal is to gain recognition, friends, and become Hokage. 2nd There is a plot twist where a deep rift between Sasuke and Naruto occurs, leaving Naruto chasing after him even now. Lastly they give a bit of background information and future predictions to tie things up.  In Shippuden however I feel like many characters were given the chance to grown and even shine in some battles. Sakura is a perfect example. Now I’m not a fan of Sakura, but she was absolutely useless prior to Shippuden, so at least now she’s not entirely holding people back. The fight against Sasori proved her worth. I thoroughly enjoyed how much background information was given about the ninja world, as well as particular charterers. You finally get answers about Naruto’s past including a detailed story about his parents. You learned about the 9-Tails. You learn about the other beasts, and the Uchiha. The plots are far more interesting and involve much more symbolism. Don’t get me wrong I think the 1st series set it up nicely for Shippuden, I just enjoy what Shippuden focuses on. It’s more about progression. It’s much more dark and mature.  The struggles are much more intense and immersive. Each major antagonist sends the show into a major background story, and they did well by tying them all together. I find Shippuden much more interesting and easier to relate to as it more mature. They incorporated many more characters and even took the time to show off the other countries abilities and histories. I feel like everyone has a bigger part to play in this series and Naruto has become much more likable as he progressed.",1

Naruto is not my first love but is by far the truest.  Every new episode surprises and enchants me.  I can't really say that I saw most of the major things in this series coming and am pleased.It has kick A action, comedy, drama, adventure, heart felt emotions.  I've laughed, cried and celebrated with the Naruto crew.  I've seen every single episode and even collected all the characters as miniature dolls.  I am so dedicated I'm even learning Japanese.Naruto is an amazing series so a big bravo to it's creator, writers and entire crew.  They should be proud.I'm not trying to give anything away, specially because it's so much more pleasant to find out on your own then have someone tell you what happened before you have a chance to get to it. So all I will say is that this will get you hooked.  Be prepared to become addicted and need a daily dose of Naruto.  I can't wait to go wherever this wants to take me.Bravo!!!Ari",3

rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"This is addressed to people who've been complaining about Re:Zero recently, I wont use any specifics to avoid spoilers but there'll be some general topics mentioned, so maybe don't read if you're not up to date.I've seen a massive amount of people complaining about Subaru being underpowered or even saying that he's useless and that it detracts from the series. I want to say that you're wrong, obviously you get your own opinion but I want to make my point. People say that Subaru can't do anything himself and can't solve problems, and yes it does take him a long time to progress but conflict in necessary in a story. Would this be any fun if Subaru overcame every problem easily? No. If you don't want conflict in your anime go watch a slice of life. And yes he is physically weak compared to others, but think about their background versus his. He's a shut-in who worked out at home to defend his house, and he's fighting trained warriors or terrifying monsters. Would you be able to win those fights?Other people are frustrated by how Subaru can seem selfish or desperate, but that's how real people act. Subaru does lash out at people, and he makes mistakes, but humans are flawed and you have to think about the trauma he's gone through. What he goes through could leave anyone scarred, but he's fighting through it. I don't know why you'd want to watch a series where the MC doesn't struggle and grow.And finally some people are complaining that the show is too sad, or too dark. Deal with it. This is a morbid show, it showed that in episode 1, and now the suffering is getting worse. If you don't like it I'd be happy to direct you do a nice happy anime (K-On, Azumanga Daioh, Konosuba). I'm sorry if I seemed patronizing or annoying, but please don't mindlessly complain. If you want to have a respectable debate on the quality of Re:Zero, by all means talk to me, but don't just say it's bad.",4.5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"I'm writing this after watching the first episode.  I have also read the manga adaptation of the light novel this series is based on (don't worry no spoilers), which has a big influence on my opinion.As for my first impression of this anime I give it a 5 out of 5.  This is simply because I really enjoy the manga and from what I get from the first episode I think the anime will actually be better (which you won't hear people say too often). Compared to the manga, the story progresses very smoothly with time taken to develop the side characters that the manga just awkwardly stumbles over.I've read many comments that compare this show to Konosuba.  While both shows involve a track suite wearing otaku getting sent to a fantasy world with a fair share of female character, that's where the similarities end.  The ""teleport to a fantasy world"" storyline is so common in anime and manga that it is just silly to compare these two based on that alone, though to be fair, the track suite thing is kind of weird.  Konosauba is a satire of the cliché ""teleport to a fantasy world"" storyline.  On the Other hand, Re:Zero, while following the ""teleport to a fantasy world"" storyline, has a very unique and well done mystery aspect that you just don't see in the fantasy genre.  If its anything like the manga the mystery plot will get really good as the show progresses.My only criticism is on those ugly mob characters that look like they were created in MMD.  Though I overlooked this because the background art and the general atmosphere was very well done.  The evening scenes in particular where especially pleasing to look at.",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"Starting out, anyone who has watched significant anime in the past few years will be frustrated by the well-trodden premise of this series of a modern day hikkomori-sans-physical-stereotypes who is inexplicably conjured to a fantasy world; indeed even the protagonist Subaru would seem to agree. However, if it falls into any well trodden path, it would be closer to the concept of All You Need Is Kill[produced into the film Edge of Tomorrow], which is far less of a problem to have for resulting in a compelling production.Very quickly into the two parter opening will these concerns melt away. The tone of this series is delightfully muted and it seriously beings me back to older anime from about 8-10 years ago in tone, and it takes itself pretty seriously on plot and doesn't seek cheap laughs or overbearing comedic references of travel back from the modern world or otaku references. Character interactions are slow to develop and it seems like they defiantly will make us care about every character and their relationship with the other characters, even as they vary through the possible timelines. With the hugely skewed number of female protagonists it seems doomed to meet certain limitations there but that is about the only flaw I can see so far in character development, which is quite rare for this era.But the real gem here is the simple but well developed premise of the series, which leads to the motivation to essentially solve a self-imposed puzzle game. Suddenly every even minor action the main protagonist makes is a move toward either solving or more likely losing the puzzle at hand, which is initially to prevent a seemingly unstoppable series of murders and then a much bigger mission as progress is made. It would seem every episode of the series will feature progress in the puzzle, with plenty of failed solutions to show. Good luck with that, Subaru!",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"The idea isn't new as a teenage shut-in somehow gets drug into a fantasy world, but the nuances that I am seeing offer some interesting potential.  The intrigue begins when the MC realizes what his unique position is, and has to figure out a way to free himself from a seemingly hopeless situation.  It's like being stuck in a horribly difficult rpg with limited save points, and a strict set of goals to meet between each one.  Every time he dies things get reset to a specific point, where he has to restart with the knowledge gained from his previous attempts.  The up side to this is there is very little repetition to bore people to death.  Even though he is covering the same time frame multiple times, they do a great job of keeping things fresh with the characters and scenes.  Get ready for a dark fantasy adventure spinning in circles of fate.Subaru is not quite the typical shut-in, as he works out to keep his physical condition in good shape in case of break in.  His propensity to initially buy in to the concept of being transported to a different reality is humorous at times when he keeps trying to fit events into his 'perceived reality' manufactured from games, manga, and anime.  The cold hard truth of things becomes apparent though early on as the only tools at his disposal are his wits, muscles, and an obnoxious ability to start from zero with all his memories intact.  Naturally everything and everyone else doesn't in share those experiences, so it is actually a double edged tool.  Personally I like the concept, and it looks like they are doing a good job with the story.Be forewarned, the story starts out grim and bloody, and continues from there to eventually spiral through despair and madness to a brutal and sadistic level.  The story and characters are well played though to keep you hooked even as it leaves your nerves raw at times.",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"OK 8 Episodes in, and this is a show I will absolutely never forget. There have been TONS of shows with this premise. There have been TONS of shows with this type of magic. There have been TONS of shows with this animation style. But the way the protagonist struggles in this show Its amazing. Put into the same position as he is in, I would be a living puddle on a street somewhere by episode 3. This show screams at you with pure raw real emotion almost every episode. Whether it be happiness, fear, sadness, anger. Attack on Titan conveys anger, hope, and hatred this well. Natsume Yujin Cho: Kindness. Theres plenty of shows that do a great job conveying singular or a few emotions. This show runs the gamut, and it runs them almost every single episode, all the while Giving you great action and tons of Mystery and puzzles to solve. I dont think my brain has wandered once while watching one of these after episode 1.Edit 15 eps in, and it just gets better.",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,This is a really good and intriguing anime very unique in many aspects already watched episodes 1A and 1B and already hooked. And the fact that it took the intro to reel me in is impressive because usually it takes about at least 3-5 episodes to get to the point but with this you will not be boarded you will keep coming back for more to see what happens next but don't let this review persuade you watch it and experience it yourself. And I know there are reviews that say this is like another anime but that is irrelevant this anime is its own and has a very good story line and how it is plotted hope to have a blast with this and warning episode 1B Leaves you with a cliffhanger which is Awsome.,5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"At first when I started this serious I thought it was an interesting concept. I felt the character development was rather slow and that the main protagonist or ""hero"" was weak.Then as I finished episode 15 today, I have come to see the magnificence of this serious and how it is all fitting together. I have experienced laughter, sorrow, pain, grief and frustration. What an emotional rollercoaster, please take the time to watch this anime and support authors and studios that would produce such quality works.",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,This is not konosuba After watching 1a/1b  I instantly fell in love with this anime. However my first impression was that it this would be an average neet shut-in anime that would have a bunch of cliché scenes and it would be just a regular anime for this season. Well boy I tell you my opinion sure did change when I watched 1b. I have no credit in this community but but take my word  this anime will not disappoint and from here it can only get better. Re:Zero depending on how it plays out can probably become one of the best animes for 2016 and climb to the top anime favorites of lots of people.  Watch this anime!!!,5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"So watched 19 episodes so far with my friend. This anime is good...like really good.A fairly generic premise of a slightly loser guy from the real world getting summoned to a fantasy world. He has a special power that makes him yadda yadda yadda...the premise made me pass it over, only a friend who'd seen it recommending it to me made me try it.I am now going to be that friend to you, try this show. It is an amusing and well executed twist on fairly generic anime tropes for the first few episodes, then it does something I've seen another anime recently do.One Punch Man asked the question of what would emotionally/psychologically happen to a real person if he attained ultimate power. Saitama becomes bored and loses desire to do anything when his enemies die sin one punch.Re:Zero goes the same route, what would actually happen to a real person if he died, an incredibly terrifying, painful, scared, desperate death, then suddenly woke up and had to do it all over? All his achievements and and memories or good experiences are wiped away along with the bad ones. Motivation becomes hard to find, the few times he ""checkpoints"" become branching points, and he emotionally has to find stable points to grasp to.This is what truly made me sit up in my seat and bump this anime up from a fun and interesting 4 star, to a 5 star anime that other anime NEED to take cues from. My cardinal sin in anime is the bland milquetoast main character, and Natsuki Subaru leaves that trope behind and does something fresh, interesting, and well executed. Which is all I can ask honestly when most of the anime coming out is the same generic schlock.Oh and  got waaaay invested in the characters. Waaaaay invested, which made the trials they go through so much more poignant.",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"This anime was a surprising blessing for me to watch. It immediately captured my attention from episode 1A, and I obviously went right for 1B afterwards. I was so captivated in the anime that I actually had the countdown of it playing for about 18 hours before the episode 2 came out itself. The ED song, and the OP are definitely great as well, very fun anime to watch. My main disappointment was-Main character IS clueless, but only in a few ways. Once he actually gets the hang of something he knows what to do.This anime is great in leaving you off with a feel that you want to come back, just to find out what's going to happen next. You know those books where you just hate the story, but you keep reading because you're so interested in what's going to happen next? This anime COULD be like that for you. Personally however, the anime captivated my attention from the first 15 seconds, and I'm definitely going to be around for all 25 episodes. (Yes, it IS going to be a 25 episode series.) Very intriguing anime, never seen a timeleap in a medieval timeline. I'm hoping this anime gets a lot more positive attention, because in my honest opinion it does deserve it.",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"I heard about the hype this show was getting so I decided to give it a shot. Boy am I glad that I did. It simply blew me away. The music, the animation, the characters, and the story were all brilliant. This so can also be very brutal but the payoff so far is huge. Lastly the main character Natsuki Subaru is really entertaining to watch for me, I love his character. Definitely watch this show!!Edit: After finishing the series it is alongside Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood as my two favorite anime. I have even bought all the manga and light novels currently out to show my support for the series.",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"As a diligent disciple, I cannot begin to express my respect for this anime. From the beginning, I knew this was more than some wretched, ugly, lowly, diminutive, sinful anime that shamelessly copies other themes or plotlines. Yes, He is wearing a tracksuit. Yes, He was transported to another world. YES YES YES. YES! MY BRAIN TREMBLES! However, this is where the similarities end. Truly a beautiful picture of madness and despair at times, this anime manages to elicit emotions that others simply CANNOT. The usual standards of character development, animation, soundtrack, and plot are all, without doubt or hesitation, five stars..... no, six stars. It is indeed the picture of true diligence and presented as such. This show is unique and both its protagonist and villain are AMAZING as well as the supporting cast.  This is an unforgettable work of art that must not be ignored and must be diligently watched to its conclusion. To ignore any parts of this would be.......truly slothful.",4.5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"I think everyone goes through those three phases when watching this: like, hate, then love. The hate started for me during the arc when Subaru was trying to survive at the mansion. It seemed rather pointless and plodding at the time, and I didn't like the maid characters at all. The animation and action scenes were also not very appealing to me. That was the worst arc by far for me, but after seeing the whole show, I have gained a better appreciation of that arc as it sets the stage for his psychological breakdown later on. I think most other people liked that arc and hated the next arc where Subaru was trying to prevent utter disaster on his own and was rather pathetic and unlikable. I actually think that arc was very well-done, and it showcased the tremendous obstacles he would have to overcome in the final arc. The final arc was mostly satisfying, and it culminated in a really great ending. Many (dare I say most) animes have very poor endings with lots of dangling plot points. The ending here feels like a solid resolution of a major story arc without actually being the end of the greater story, which seems like it still has a lot of meat to it. It has its good and bad points, but ultimately I love the story.One thing I loved throughout the whole show was the animation. Every episode was consistently well-animated, even when the story called for some pretty crazy sequences. Some of the character designs and animations really left a huge impression. Betelgeuse, in particular, was just a fascinatingly constructed character all around. The voice actors also did an outstanding job. Subaru's voice actor was the standout, being required to go through quite a wide range of emotions and attitudes. The voice actor for Betelgeuse was terrific as well, and you will never hear anything like him ever again, I guarantee it. Some other voice actors were a little too typical, but overall, the quality of the performances was very good.I'm looking forward to season 2, assuming it gets a second season.",4.5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"Definitely my favourite anime and I'm not even to gory stuff because it definitely had its moments where it made your brain tremble, but, surprisingly enough, it appealed to the majority of anime community and made its way to my top 10 and eventually won my heart. Its story-telling is remarkable and the author sure knows how to foreshadow things for the distant future.If you except a certain episode which makes me think about it for a bit, I'd surely watch it all over again with no regrets! Already watched couple of the latest episodes several times by now!",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"Never had I ever gone from tearing up in sadness to tearing up in happiness and joy in the span of 2 episodes until I saw Re:Zero. Never before had I seen a show with much tragedy, loss, deep depictions of sadness and insanity, but also have just as much hope and purity until I saw Re:Zero. This show just blew me away. The characters, the voice-acting, the writing, the animation, man all of it is just fantastic. The story is fairly unique and the characters that drive it are some of the best I've ever seen in any anime. Honestly this show, to me, is masterfully done and has quite easily earned my love and respect. So go watch, you won't regret it.",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"VisualsThe visuals were consistent throughout most of the show with animation errors being few and far between. Things at time could get bloody without being too gory or ridiculous with the amount of blood... at times. However the visuals were never ugly, sometimes creepy but not unintentionally so.Story The story is one of the best things about this anime, you've more than likely seen or watched something with a similar but it's rare for something to do it so well. The story for this was great and you can tell more thought was put into a lot of areas of the story. However by the end of season one you will find yourself still asking quite a few questions that may not ever get an answer in anime form.Characters The characters in this show by far are the best thing about it. Subaru by far is the most human character I've ever watched in anything be it anime, movie, or your average TV show. Subaru's character development happens throughout the course of the show and very rarely will you feel as if he did not grow, even if it is just a little bit. However this show has a really bad habit of introducing interesting characters that seem to disappear into thin air or only show up a small handful of times.3D/CGI CGI sticks out like a sore thumb in this anime as it does in any other, however it only really appears in the capital to help show how busy the streets are, so while it is present it doesn't ruin anything.",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"Wow... i was really skeptical about this anime. I'm tired of the ""otaku gets transported for a fantasy world"" thing but out of the blue i decided to watch the first episode (it's divided in two parts, A and B).Now, what a great, great anime!!! It has a really ""Erased"" vibe and the characters are so good, the twists so well written... and WHAT A VILLAIN!!!! So creepy and disturbing!It will be hard to keep the quality of this first episode, if they manage to achieve that, we can be watching a true masterpiece!",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"Simply stunning work. The animation is great; I'm glad they limited the amount of CG to some background characters and ground dragons instead of rendering major assets like buildings. Art style (character design, etc.) is easy on the eyes, meshing well with the gorgeous world design and backgrounds. Music is fantastic and diverse, always complementing each scene--never understating or overstating. White Fox blows me away with this masterful adaptation. I want to thank everyone involved on their hard work, and I can't wait to see how they tackle the rest of the series.",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"I thought this anime would be an anachronistic light comedy with some romance and maybe a little action.  Having just finished watching episode 18, I am still astounded by the brutality used by these storytellers in ripping emotions out your guts like a certain assassin who will not be named.I feel like I should warn particularly delicate individuals that if they're not prepared to be emotionally savaged by this story, they may need to choose a lighter subject matter like the earlier mentioned Stein's Gate, or maybe Madoka Magica.  The anime is quite beautiful and the character designs are distinctive and enjoyable. The character concepts wedded to those designs are interesting and have more depth than you would expect, especially for the supporting characters who are less walk on parts than they are people with multiple facets to their personalities.  Who would have expected that the appa vendor had a backstory but by 10 episodes in you began to really know more about how he fits into the market and city environment.It's the additional investment in all the side stories that makes Subaru's adventure seem more real when compared to a story solely focused on his relationship with Emilia.  I wait every week until Sunday for the next episode to stream, even though the last few episodes have made it feel like I was waiting for someone to stab me in the guts and start pulling out my intestines.  Despite the unease, anticipation of pain, and suffering I feel, I can't just leave well enough alone because I've become invested in this story.  If it weren't so good, I could just abandon it, but that's the rub, it is that good.",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"(Written after watching episode 6, but as spoiler-free as possible!)Firstly, I have to say that I was not expecting this show to be this good. I signed up for a conventional fantasy-type adventure, that isn't particularly original, but still delivers. Well. I got that. And more.This show takes all the conventions, tropes, and stereotypes of fantasy animes and games, and plays around with them to make a legitimately enjoyable piece of fiction. It hooks you in places where you expect the predictable and keeps you on the edge of your seat (which almost never happens to me).It's funny, romantic, gory, and filled with twists, but it balances all these things pretty well. However, I have to say it is the relationships between characters which really keeps you watching it. They're all so complex, which makes them more unique that those of other fantasy animes.",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,Currently at 2 episodes the show has the potential to be great. If they take the time to develop the story and dont rush things you wont want to miss this anime. The show has a main character who suddenly appears in an alternate universe who then begins to roam around and start his adventure assuming that he is destined for something great. Has some early comedic remarks by the main character but begins to go to another level after the first episode. After watching episode 2 i'm sitting here wanting more and knowing that i'll be counting down the days till the next episode each week,5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"This is simply myself writing a review after watching the only episode out right now. Surely I couldn't come up with a decent review seeing as I've only seen one episode; however, you can tell if most anime are good or not from the get go after watching the first episode. Now, I see people seem to be complaining about the fact it doesn't make sense that he hasn't caught onto the fact that he Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hidehas repeated time. Now, I've not read the manga nor watched the anime people are calling similar to this, but from what I have seen this anime has good animation and beautiful designs and great world building. People don't seem to remember that, Subaru is only human. Humans will deny things they don't understand and try to block it out. Now, I agree that ""being transported to another dimension"" has been used before, but it's how it is used is what makes the difference between original and unoriginal. From what I have seen, this show has taken it to another level and is much darker than anime that have this same characteristic in the fantasy genre.I can't wait to see the next episode. It was a thrill and I was left wanting more at the end. It's definitely a must watch, even with material that has been used before. I was impressed as nothing seemed too rushed, nor did it look like they cut corners. If you like fantasy anime with a more mysterious and darker take, this is the anime for you without a doubt. Also, it has cute girls. What's not to like?",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"This is an epic. Made up of scenes and sequences, its narrative nonetheless coheres into something extraordinary because it is basically philosophical.I'm not going to say that other ways of looking at it are not valid, or even that I am right, but I truly believe Re:Zero is a remarkable depiction of love, our need for it and fear of it and pursuit of it and mourning for it. Every reset brings Subaru deeper into love, not only for Emilia but for other characters, combined with the fact that every time he does it, someone he loves will not know how much or why he loves them.Given this, the utter horror of much of the show makes perfect sense, because it is about the terrors of love, the way we invest in it and fight for it and die for it. All the resets bring mixtures of gratification for love, but none bring the combination Subaru can put his finger on and say ""That's it!""Because that's not the way love is.It's certainly a great adventure story with uncountable other facets. But for me, its look at love is unflinching and brilliant. It's hard for us all to face the fragility and uncertainty of our love. This show wrestles us down and rubs our face in it. If we can take it, we should be grateful that it took the time to do that.",5

rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"I'll be focusing on the writing of the characters for this review, as I believe it to be the most essential partAt points, you'll hate Subaru, at points, you'll believe he's a honest to heart great protagonist, and for that I give the author props, it's hard to make a character lovable otaku who wants to get the main heroine, to an absolute asshole, to then a lovable guy who wants to save the one he loves, along with side-characters who show their true colours, and their true personality based on what Subaru had done.The MusicI find the music in this anime to be on the gothic side, especially the openings, the first OP pops to be as a gothic song, with the sounds in it pointing me to that answer, and I personally like that. The anime already had a dark tone with the first episode, not being afraid to show gore, which lead into the OP perfectly. Watch Mother's Basement for a full review on the OP, since he's great at that. The second OP was less 'gothic' in a sense, but it still kept the feeling, MYTH&ROID did a great job on this one, the violin stands out with the vocal chopping of the singer. Every instrument was able to shine with this (IMO it was a great OSU beatmap lol!). Stay Alive, sung by Emilia's CV, was genuinely perfect. It brought me to tears at episode 23, the animation staff really know how to take away the boringness of an ending, making this actually one of the first anime where I watched every ending, as the anime was continued into the endings, keeping it interesting as the music began to join in. STYX_HELIX is not as great in my opinion, however in episode 25 it really works well, it's a great slow ending for a quick, fast paced episode (I mean the rest of them). The OST is great, it's able to sneak its way in without you realizing, and takes you by surprise when something major, or something that's meant to strum your heartstrings, it really hits you hard then, and you'll notice it.Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideCharacters + a bit of StoryWARNING, LONG AF)Where do we start? Subaru himself as I stated before is a perfect example of character growth, with many other anime you'll see the character become more modest if they're OP AF, or become more caring like Oregairu, or something else. But here we see none of that, we see a weak, powerless, selfish character, who did everything out of his love for the main heroine (who didn't even like him back), into a smart, tactical, relatively strong (mentally wise), caring character. You must understand the amount of pain Subaru had to have gone through mentally to have to die that many times, and still have the willpower to continue fighting, knowing that he'll have to experience the exact same thing if he doesn't do anything. This does get to him, and he has a breakdown for 6 episodes, before he can regain his thoughts with the help of Rem. As I know many of you can think of many times through out the anime where you thought: ""If I just kill myself and reset time, I can make things right!"" You're not wrong with that mindset, I had the exact same mindset, however, I believe the fact that Subaru doesn't just kill himself to reset everything is because he's afraid to experience the pain again, you probably would too, but realize this is a character with almost zero to none willpower until his recouping with Rem. He couldn't bring himself to do it unless it really fucked everything up (like episode 7). It's due to this fear of not wanting to die, that when he resets, he tries his absolute best to not suffer through that again, and to stay alive while making everything right, and that's where his willpower comes from. Knowing that he needs to, no, he MUST make things right, Subaru willingly resets in episode 7, and tries his best to gain the trust of Rem and Ram in the mansion, but it's here that Subaru realizes he can't keep up an act of faking, and so he returns to his selfish self for another few episodes. Episode 13 is where he cracks. Whilst most of you believed that Subaru could've just reset after his argument with Emilia, what you don't get is that Subaru NEEDED to be scolded by the one he loved, the one he said he was fighting for, to realize that he was just being selfish, and not actually doing this out of any means. Think of it this way, if Subaru had reset, he would be in fear that something horrid might happen to Emilia if he had not gone, or worst, he would've still been a selfish character until the end of the anime, not solving anything. This scolding by Emilia was absolutely necessary for Subaru to develop into the main character of most Isekai genres, and for him to love Emilia, without saying that's the only reason he was fighting. He gains more things to fight for in his slump, Rem, the mansion, all the other characters, he gains the knowledge to fight, and the willpower to not cower in fear anymore. His encounters with Betelgeuse had definitely taken a toll on him, you can even see him physically giving up, however, after his talk with Rem, he loses this fear, and accepts the fact that he can't win alone, even becoming comrades with the knight that started the events in episode 12, this is a major turning point for Subaru, and it's because of this that he becomes such a great, rich, interesting character. Rem. While most of you just blatantly scream out: ""REM BEST GIRL!!!"" due to her appearance in episode 18, I must say that I absolutely agree with you, Rem is an amazing character for doing that for Subaru, it ultimately saved him as a character, and without her, he would've stayed in his slump, not solving anything. However take a look at Rem in every other episode, she's a tsundere even if you don't think about it, it's not a normal tsundere, and whilst I would say it's about 10% tsundere, the rest of it is her being loyal to her master who saved her that night in the village, and the will to protect her older sister, who sacrificed everything for her. Rem shows extreme loyalty, but also shows her cute side from time to time, along with her satanic form, in order to save Subaru from the moment they team up. I find it quite interesting when she just started to love Subaru as he showed her another side of herself, the loyal, monster-slaying demon Rem, falling for Subaru over one good deed. It's not a bad thing, but it's quite the interesting development. Emilia. Most of you would say she's a generic heroine, who doesn't understand the hero's love for her, but she's more than that. She's a selfish character, who just wants to do right in the world due to her looking exactly like the Witch. Since I'm already doing minor spoilers. Emilia knows she knows she's the Witch Satella, in appearances that is, being half-elf, almost everyone, even commoners, know that she is a perfect resemblance of the Jealous Witch, however, in episode 1A, she tells Subaru her name is Satella in order to keep him out of the throne wars, as telling someone she is Satella, the Jealous Witch, would normally scare someone off almost immediately, however Subaru, being from another world, doesn't connect the dots, and in return Emilia decides that he is worth trusting, as he wouldn't give her special treatment that everyone else around her does, and that's why she told him her real name. She decided then and there that someone who wouldn't judge her based off her looks would be worth trusting and believing in, as all she had been receiving was special treatment from everyone around her. She's a selfish character not in a bad way, as all she wanted was to be treated normally, and because of that selfishness, she becomes selfless, doing anything to get anyone to treat her like she isn't the Jealous Witch. IMO, it's a mix of selfishness + selflessness to become a normal person. This is what makes Emilia an interesting character alongside Subaru, because whilst the story revolves around him, the tales we get here and there about Emilia are extremely interesting and shows why she's doing all she did, why she trusts Subaru, why she cares for him (even a bit), and why she wants to become the ruler. Emilia. Best. Girl. She doesn't realize all she's done to help Subaru progress, scolding him was such a vital part to the story, I cannot say how many props I could give to her, she doesn't understand why Subaru does why he does, why he cries his lungs out, why he loves her, why he does anything, but due to her trust in him because he gave her treatment of a normal person, she copes with it, and goes through it. She really is the BEST GIRL!The AnimationThis animation is superb, the fact that this anime itself is gory, the anime is able to show gory scenes, that makes your stomach feel a bit ill, but not to the point of turning away from the screen. It's the perfect amount to make you get a little bit grossed out, but enough to make you stay and watch, whilst shedding tears at time. EMILIA'S SMILE REALLY IS PERFECT!Voice ActingI find Subaru's voice actor to have a certain sound in his voice, it gives off the fact that Subaru is grossed out at times, scared at times, and in power at times. Kobayshi really knows how to do his job with Subaru, it's just fantastic. I've also got to give Matsuoka props, I didn't even realize it was him at first, normally I can recognize him instantly, but I had to make sure it was him, as he sounded so different for Betelgeuse, he really managed to live up to the expectations I had for someone who looked like Betelgeuse. Takahashi also manages a great job at making Emilia angry, sad, and happy at times. Murakawa and Minase also manage a fantastic job at the mono toned twins who speak at the exact same time, and who play off each other.Maybe I've been rambling on for too long, but that's my general thoughts of this anime, a great spin on the Isekai genre.",4.5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"best anime of year. love all of the arcs. The second is definitely the worst. The main character makes you love him and hate him at the same time. Great character development of Subaru and Rem. Not a huge fan of Emilia but I understand it based on where the series is going. It helps if you read the manga. The show will absolutely get better as you continue to watch it. Definitely need a second season because at least 11 questions are unanswered.Great if you like shows such as SAO, MAR, guilty crown, code geass.",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"There isn't much to say of Re:ZERO that hasn't been said already. It's a terrific, immersive, and engaging anime filled with likable characters, a strong and amazing story, great animation, and awesome scenarios and environments. Although there are some infuriating moments, you will finish every episode wanting to watch the next, and the next, and the next. Personally, I get bored of anime quite quickly, I tend to stop watching midway through, give up or just generally not pay attention to episodes after a while, Re:ZERO kept me watching the entire time. Not once whilst watching did I decide to pick up my phone and browse through social media out of boredom. The characters are adorable, likable, well drawn, and every other positive adjective under the sun. You find yourself really enjoying and missing the presence of even the antagonists, because every character really reflects on you - and they all feel special. It's quite a beautiful anime, and a must-watch.",4
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"I'm not one to write a super in-depth review, but I just had to find a way to rate this 5 stars here. This quickly became one of, if not, THE best animes I have seen! I originally only decided to check this out because I have seen the 2 maid girls everywhere and was one of the top things to watch on Crunchyroll and I was hooked right from the first episode. This show is an emotional roller coaster full of mysteries, funny moments, and heartwarming scenes and we should be thankful that all episodes are available to us already since almost every single one ends with a cliffhanger. Openings are great as well!I won't spoil a thing so I highly recommend EVERYONE to watch this and see what all the hype is about!",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"Very few shows, especially in anime, are  truly suspenseful. Even in a series as dark as, say, Berserk, we know that Guts will eventually win in the 2050 finale. Will bad things happen? Yes. Will people die? Most assuredly. Will Guts be a badass? Hell yeah he will. Will he ""win"" in the end? Yes, yes he will.Re:ZERO is a rare case where a show is truly suspenseful. When you watch, you watch the show with bated breath, because you know for a fact that everything Subaru (the fact that I can remember his name is a big deal to me) has worked for, all his efforts, his connections with the people he's met, his successes, his laughter and tears, all of it can be gone in an instant. We watch knowing that there is a very real danger of a good situation turning lethally bad in an instant, because that is exactly what happens multiple times over the course of the show. As we watch, we're always wondering: ""Is he going to succeed this time? Or is he going to die horrifically again?""The show is truly magical in the way it creates suspense, and it uses it to its full effect. It's also interesting to see the mental toll it takes on our protagonist. From the perspective of the show, all the events we see are happening within a few weeks. From the perspective of the secondary characters, they really haven't known Subaru for very long. From Subaru's perspective however, he's spent months in that place. He has had many more experiences with the other characters than they can ever possibly know, he's struggled more for these characters than they can ever possibly appreciate. it's a real tragedy, seeing him struggle without there being a single person that he can confide in, not one person to share the immense burden and pain he has to deal with.The show isn't perfect, but I think it's a god-damned masterpiece",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"In an increasingly epic story in which Zero is the most important number, the art, animation, voice acting, and even music keep me reliably addicted and craving more.There are moments when the amount of adversity the protagonist faces seems completely unfair or when I wish that I could take over and force him to make different choices, but the unexpected results that lead to victory make me laugh.This is a clever series, but it is also an emotional roller coaster that literally goes flying off the tracks at times. I have learned to expect the unexpected and enjoy the show rather than pick it apart, and that is a rare treat for me.",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"Re:Zero -Starting Life in Another World (ゼロから始める異世界生活, Re:Zero Kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu), is one of the brightest gems of the Summer 2016 season. While it is not something flawless, as one might think, this series is definitely doing its best to be enjoyable and interesting for its viewer. In my opinion, the fact that the creator of the series actually cares is very commendable. However, it is an open secret that trying to be fascinating and being fascinating is not the same thing. Thankfully, it is not one of these cases. Allow me to share my opinion on Re:Zero -Starting Life in Another World, on the anime that is able to leave one speechless, on the anime that bullies you, and on the anime that shows you many events, which are absolutely impossible to foresee.Re:Zero -Starting Life in Another World is a Japanese light novel series written by Tappei Nagatsuki and illustrated by Shinichirou Otsuka that also has three manga adaptations and an anime television series adaptation by White Fox, which began airing on April 4, 2016. The series tells us a story of Natsuki Subaru, a normal young man that lives his normal life in the modern Japan. However, one day, he is summoned to another world. Without knowing the person that summoned him, or the reason for being summoned in the new world, he soon befriends a silver-haired-half-elf girl, Emilia. Due to some unknown circumstances, the girl is being targeted by an unknown assassin. The assassin manages to kill the two and everything seems to be over. Yet, a second later, Natsuki Subaru awakens and discovers his new ability that he names ""Return by Death."" That new ability gives him the power to reverse time by dying; however, only he remembers the events of the previous timeline. Why was Natsuki Subaru summoned in this mysterious world, who gave him the power to reverse time? Find the answer by watching Re:Zero -Starting Life in Another World now. The first thing that might come to your mind after reading the description of Re:Zero -Starting Life in Another World’s story-line  is that this anime is a mix of Steins;Gate, Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo!, and Boku dake ga Inai Machi. And I must say that you will be right to think so. Of course, this anime has nothing to do with comedy, but all these four anime do have a few things in common. Anyway, Re:Zero -Starting Life in Another World reworks all mistakes of its predecessors doing its best to be entertaining and I must say that Re:Zero -Starting Life in Another World manages to do it. It is an open secret that the most important thing for all story-lines is to be complex: one should never be able to foresee more than thirty percent of events that will happen in the next episodes. In case of the anime we are talking about, you might have theories on first, on second, …, on thirteenth episodes, but all your theories will be destroyed in an instant. That is, in my opinion, the best part about the story-line of this anime. The animation of Re:Zero -Starting Life in Another World is mostly top notch. There are many characters, they have sometimes unusual and sometimes very beautiful outfits, monsters, demons, some unknown creatures, and magic spells and they all are beautiful. At the same time, when this anime should become dark, it becomes dark. It is so amazing that it helps you to dive in the universe of Re:Zero -Starting Life in Another World. Without a doubt, it is not flawless, but it is on the level, which is very important for all anime that have such a setting. The OST is on the level, as well. From pop music to amazing orchestral pieces, Re:Zero -Starting Life in Another World even focuses on music, which some anime tend to not do. Of course, it is not that important, but the amount of attention this anime pays to its music only helps you to dive into the universe of Re:Zero -Starting Life in Another World and to understand it better. I will not hide the fact that sometimes the music should have been more epic: when you see a good battle, the music should be epic very, but it is still able to make you have gooseflesh. Another part of this section, which is also worth mentioning, is the cast of this anime. All voice actors did one hell of a job making their characters vivid and lively. If it is a villain, you hate them with all of your heart, if it is one of the main heroes, you just wish that they succeed in everything they do and you cannot even imagine what you will do if something bad happens to them. The cast of Re:Zero -Starting Life in Another World consists of the main characters, Rem and Natsuki Subaru, supporting characters, and villains. While I would argue that the main characters do not receive enough development, I completely agree with the fact that supporting characters should have received more development. However, I believe that the main characters and the villains compensate for it well, since Re:Zero -Starting Life in Another World has the edgiest villains that you have ever seen in your life. Anyway, let us talk about the main characters: Rem and Natsuki Subaru.Natsuki Subaru is the male protagonist of the series. On the way home from the convenience store, he is suddenly summoned to another world. He later discovers an ability that he names ""Return by Death"" that allows him to go back in time, if he dies. And the most interesting part about it is that only he remembers what happened and he cannot tell anyone about this ability. Natsuki used to be a hikimori, being absolutely useless, he has never done anything in his life. However, in this new world he should not only try to become more powerful, but also to use his wit. He will not be granted with the power to destroy the whole world, he does not have a guardian angel, or a harem of cute girls that will help him in every situation. He just has no other choice but to do everything alone, which makes him change himself. His character development is amazing and you just want to not see him suffer. Rem is the second main character of the series. She has a younger sister and both of them work at Emilia’s mansion.  When Subaru meets her, she shows absolutely no signs of being interesting; however, as the story progresses, Rem stops being a doll and becomes a very interesting character. The supporting characters of Re:Zero -Starting Life in Another World do not receive enough development; however, as I have already mentioned, the villains compensate well for it. You just want to see their death, you just want to see their sufferings, and you hate them with all of your heart. While I understand that it is impossible to grant enough screen time for all characters, I still think that all characters are very interesting to follow and it should be more than enough for you.All in all, I cannot guarantee you that you will like this series and I am not going to do it. Personally, I like the fact that this anime tries to rework mistakes of its ancestors in order to not make them again, I like the fact that the characters of this series are realistic and not overpowered like in some other series, I like the fact that it is never possible to guess what will be shown in the next episodes, which is very important, as well. With every episode, you are trying to prolong your enjoyment and to watch this series little by little; however, it is simply not possible. You just want to know what will happen in the next episodes. It is, of course, not flawless, nothing is, but if you want to see something very dark, I would highly recommend you to give Re:Zero -Starting Life in Another World a try. I hope that you will enjoy watching Re:Zero Kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu!",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"I've watched a fair amount of Anime in my time, but I've never once left a review. However, this show forced my hand. It would be unjust to experience a show like Re:ZERO and not leave a review. Fear not, there are no spoilers ahead.I leave this review as I am currently caught up at 18 episodes in, so I have a sizable amount of credibility to contribute with respect to my opinion of the show. The characters are extremely well fleshed out and frequently encounter genuine emotional and personal struggles. Gone are the days of fantasy Anime wrought with one-sided characters that prance about and merely provide entertainment. Due to the nature of one of Re:ZERO's central plot features, characters have ample time to leave a lasting impression. No side character is left to rot in the depths of obscurity. Simultaneously, side characters and main characters are included a the precise time that they are needed the most. The characters' appearances are sensible and never seem forced or unneeded. This leads to a truly immersive story line, and makes the characters seem much more like real people.The plot of Re:ZERO is nothing short of brilliant. As I said in the beginning of my review, I am not including any spoilers, so unfortunately I cannot go into much detail with regard to the content of the plot itself. However, let it suffice to say that Re:ZERO has a plot that will surely keep you guessing as you desperately try to avoid slipping off of the edge of your seat.This show delivers a dark and refreshing twist on the notorious fantasy plot that has appeared semi-frequently in recent Anime seasons. Whether you have or have not seen previous fantasy shows, Re:ZERO is a must. I have no reservations in giving this show 5 stars. Please, do yourself a huge favor and watch the show that has blown up the current season, because its popularity is not without reason.",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"If I was to review this show based solely on the protagonist, I would urge you to give it a pass. He's nothing we havent really seen before, the angsty, stubborn fool who never really does things right but tries and often gets those around him in more trouble. Typical. Where the show really shines though, is the plot.If there is a manga, I have not read it, and I came into the show knowing very little about the plot other than the synopsis posted below the poster. So after the first episode, I assumed the main mechanic of the show would not happen again, and it would follow a plot similar to other shows of this nature. I was very wrong.The mechanic of the show, as you find out in episode one, is the main character being killed, and resurrecting at a time before whatever kills him happened. I'm sure I have seen this somewhere before, but the way they handle it and the consequences, along with making it so that he fails even when he succeeds sometimes, is actually quite intriguing. The writer knows how to make the device interesting, and how to manipulate it and add in twists even when the character has seen the situation play out a dozen times before. Not many shows with this device have managed to throw a wrench in the protagonists plans when he should know what is happening, and I applaud the writers for trying to make things difficult for him. He is not a hero in the show, he is simply someone who is trying to learn the right way to do something by failing over and over again.",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"As someone who has watched a lot of anime (Yes, I'm a weeb), I can honestly say this is in my personal top 10. To anyone who is interested in watching a great anime, I can't recommend this one enough. From comedy to action to drama, this anime will play your emotions like a puppet. Just when you think you've had enough, it'll pull you right back in. Anyone looking to cringe, laugh, cry, and truly enjoy the art of anime MUST watch this anime. BE PREPARED FOR THE EMOTIONAL ROLLERCOASTER YOU WILL INEVITABLY BE RIDING.",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"I'm really confused on how I should review this show because of the fact that it's both awesome and bad at the same time. The show treats our dear friend Subaru as a worthless being and throws us for a loop whenever we feel that Subaru may just be a badass.I feel like there's a lot to say about this show but I just cannot put it into words. The show somehow manages to sneak in a new plot twist every other episode; leaving you to think you understand everything but then pulling the rug from under you and saying, ""Oh you didn't see that coming?""I feel really bad for Subaru and I really just want to see him succeed.Take caution when watching this anime, and be ready for **** to hit the fan real quick.",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"Don't watch it, you'll regret everything. You'll be emotionally abused on every level. Curiosity, love, hope, confusion, anger, hate, regret, sadness, despair. I can't even begin to explain how bad I feel for the MC and I can't explain how many jaw dropping moments and headphone dropping walk aways I've had, and I'm 15 episodes in, if you get emotionally attached to characters and put yourself in an MC's position you have been warned.",4.5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"I just finished episode 8. Since the first few seconds of the first episode, I've been completely, 100% captivated by this show. The twists are phenomenal, the characters are amazing and so fleshed out, the music is so, so good, the animation is awesome, the voice acting.... I honestly can't get enough of this show. I don't know how it ends and I don't need to to give this anime a 5 star review. Just this intro alone qualifies it as one of, if not the best anime (or show in general!) I have ever seen.",4.5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,I went into this show not expecting very much. I saw the cover art and thought oh looks like a brain dead harem comedy or something. I threw it on to pass the time while I was doing other stuff. It didn't take long before I stopped doing anything else and just sat down to watch. WOW what a great progression in this show. The story and characters really change. By episode 15 it is a total cluster frak of emotions!Watch this show and thank me later!,5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"This show so far is a masterpiece. Which I do not say lightly.The first few episodes may lead you to believe that it's generic boy goes to another world get powers blah blah blah. And while the show does have some of that it goes deeper. The set is just an element of this show. The show isn't about action and adventure. It's about life and death. Violence is a reoccurring theme and it isn't taken lightly. Prepare for heartbreak. If violence bothers you sit this one out.   The characters are so in depth. They are portrayed as people, and like people aren't black and white neither are the characters. Subaru the main protagonist is a perfect example of this. Subaru is so well written and his character is so complex.URGH. I love me some complex characters. Honestly I haven't finished and I'm not sure exactly whats going on but that's the point. Get ready for a wild ride this show does NOT disappoint. Speechless and impressed are two words that come to mind. If you have any reservations or doubts throw them out the window. The tropes in this show (identical twins,elf princesses, hero from another world, magical powers, parallel world) are meant to attract the audience viewer initially but the masterful writing and plot WILL, I repeat WILL, make you stay. Sit through the first bit because it doesn't become apparent until later episodes. Anyway please watch this show. If you like fantasy, grittiness, mystery and nail biters this one is for you.",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"It is better to ignore the reviews and commit to two episodes. The ideas of re:zero may find inspiration from tried and tested story mechanics, yet its presentation gives a fresh compelling experience. It is a lot of fun to watch, breaks genre definition and constantly engaging.A unique prose within anime. Excellent presentation with a rather compelling concept. A lot of unexpected ideas flow within what is otherwise initially perceived as a typical anime.I am really quite impressed. I would not have thought that I'd be hooked on what could be classified as a teenage love drama, thing is it blends in so well with well crafted lore, humour and anime lover's spit. So good. I highly recommend.",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"The story isn't the best, it's not all that surprising or clever with twists, but I find it INCREDIBLY engaging, thus my rating. I am thoroughly entertained and I think most people who like anime of a ""transported to another world"" premise will probably enjoy it too.If you are the type of person that HATES watching a show serially, week by week, DO NOT START THIS. Just wait for the season to end and binge it. I kind of wish I could have done that but now that I've started I just can't stop.I honestly wasn't expecting much... the premise had me initially throw it into the same category as SAO or Log Horizon (S2), but this really is more akin to Overlord or Gate with how well it's holding me. It's light hearted, upbeat, and cutesy at times, but not afraid to go for the throat and tear your soul to shreds as you wait for next Sunday's episode...",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"I've watched 7 episodes so far and this for me has been the most exciting show for me this year. I find myself longing for Sunday to come around just so I can have my heart ripped apart by the tragedy involved in this show.You may have seen in other comments that this show is being compared to Konosuba and Erased. While both those shows were great in their own right they are in my opinion very different and shouldn't really be compared. Also so far I would say that this show is as good maybe even better so I don't feel similarities matter as you could say they are similar but both could be compared to countless other shows for the same reason people are comparing this one to them.This next bit is just the rough opening story but I get that some people want to go into shows not knowing much at all so click it if you want.Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideThe story revolves around a guy called Subaru who gets sent to a fantasy world for no obvious reason and every time he dies he gets sent back to an earlier point on his timeline. For me this show has all the components to be great. The characters don't feel rushed, the story is entertaining, well developed and for me at least unpredictable, and overall I find this anime very exciting. This show is very gory in stages which I am a fan of and I like that so far the adult rating on MAL is because of the gore rather than because of nudity (don't get me wrong I like fan service, ect.. as much as the next person but it refreshing that a show doesn't need it and instead focuses on the story rather than adding unnecessary scenes for such things to happen in).This show also has elements of action and tragedy along with romance and a little bit of mystery. In the long run it seems quite obvious that relationships are going to develop quite a lot so romance will probably take on a more major role in later episodes.I definitely think most people will enjoy this and so would suggest everyone gives it a try.10/10 so far.",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"Based on first 2 episodes people are comparing this to Erased & Konosuba, but that is like saying Back to the Future is the same as Terminator since they both have time travel in the story. Don't get me wrong, all titles compared are great, but the similarities are only skin deep. They share the premise of an alternate world, A shut in MC and a time travel like reset, but it essentially ends there. The MC of Konosuba is a shut in, but died and was given the choice to enter a parallel world, and is mostly a comedy series. The track suit shut in trope is not original to Konosuba. The MC of Re:ZERO simply hopped over to this parallel world without much fanfare. Also, Re:ZERO has comedy, but is a lot more serious than Konosuba.The MC of Erased goes back in time when an bad event happens, he doesn't have to die for it to trigger & he is also fully aware of it. The MC of Re:ZERO is unaware of it it thus far & it's triggered upon his death and it causes disorientation, likely due to the shock and pain of death. Bottom line, things may look similar at first, but if you look closer you'll find that each stands on their own & Re:ZERO is very interesting so far, it landed a top position in my queue.",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"This series has an interesting take on the isekai genre, throwing out the tropes of an OP MC and the of notions power attainment. This has a mirror in Konosuba, but unlike that series does not use it as a means of comedy. Instead Re:Zero explores how an ordinary man finds his way and creates purpose in a strange, yet rather typical, new fantasy world. The result is series that focuses on character development, with a slow burn on the overall plot progression.",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"Quick Review:(Note: This anime is VERY dark. If you are watching this with the expectation that it will be similar to Konasuba or Danmachi you are not going to be happy.)Plot: 18 Year old Natsuki Subaru appears in fantasy world where he meets a young Half-Elf named Emilia. As the story progresses he realizes that there are ""Save Points"" in which he needs to reach to progress, one wrong move and he will deal with the repercussion of what he has done and sent back to  the previous ""Save Point"". The ""Save Point"" can range any amount of days from the old ""Save Point"", Subaru must endure these deaths to ensure his friends safety and his own survival. Characters: In all honesty, this show has a cast of characters that are AMAZING.Subaru? Shitty MC but the amount of Character Development he gets toward the mid-end season is amazing.Emilia? Great side character, wants to unite the world so that everyone is treated equally. Rem? BEST FUCKING GIRL DON'T @ METhe cast of characters pretty much will have you like this: "" Oh I absolutely hate this character"" *2 Episodes later*""BEST CHARACTER, BEAUTIFUL EXECUTION!""Final Verdict:Re:Zero is an anime i went into with the expectation of hating, and I did at one point. The anime is not necessarily bad, but mid season definitely gets dragged on for reasons I will not explain for the sake of spoilers.Season 2 has been announced yet we have no idea when that will be. But overall like the Title of this review states; It is a great Series, you honestly just need A LOT of patience for our MC to realize his wrongs.",5

He finds a young lady who's name is Stella(Emilia) and helps her with finding her lost item.

rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"What would you do if you had a chance to hit the reset button? Re: Zero starts out like the typical transported to another world anime. Main character otaku/shut-in who is gonna get all the power and all the harems.......Except he doesn't. Even in the first ten minutes of the first episode, the main character Subaru complains about being under-powered. However, he discovers that upon his death he rewinds and resets from a certain point(which changes throughout the show). I find myself relating to Subaru on many different occasions. More times than not his efforts are too little too late. Through many resets he manages to save the heroine and others but..... That's just a small part of what Re: Zero tries to portray. Subaru is a flawed human being who at times, doesn't take others feelings into consideration and it royally screws him over more than once. His suffering and struggling are more emotional and mental than physical. Though if you take into consideration that he has to physically experience dying over and over and over, that's pretty rough as well. Can you imagine watching yourself fail....and then having to relive that experience over again? He adamantly grips onto the idea that his actions are for the better of others when in reality, it's for his own self-gratification. He often doesn't take others feelings into consideration and worse of all.....he can't admit when he is wrong. Very human response and a mistake and issue we have all dealt with once or twice. I feel like too many fans grip onto the idea that the main heroine ""owes"" him her love and kindness because of the things he has done for her. I see the same behavior in real life when people expect that because you are their friend, they should have to date you.  Still, Subaru learns from his mistakes and he grows. He mans up to his problems(after some coaxing and prodding) and pushes forward. As a protagonist, I put him around the same level as Shinji from Neon Genisis. One who despite his flaws and ever-growing trauma still makes the effort. He makes friends, makes allies, and most importantly, he learns what self-sacrifice really is. If your looking for a straight forward, cute anime, probably not for you. The pacing can be a bit odd at times, sometimes slow, and then full throttle at the drop of a pin. One episode is completely composed of dialogue and though I appreciated the sentiment of the episode. I can understand where it might turn people off. The story can jump at times and be slightly confusing if you weren't paying close attention in the early episodes, which can kind of suck. Overall I would say it's not horrible. The characters are pretty inspiring. Even the side characters have good motivation and depth. The animation is well done and artistic. The audio both sub and dub are enjoyable and clean. The plot, if you can follow and stick with it, does have some good points and can really make you feel. Especially if you keep in mind that the protagonist doesn't just hit a reset button. HE HAD to feel the death, which if you have every had a near death experience is terrifying. Overall 4 out of 5. If the pacing and story was a little more coherernt I would give it 5 out 5. Hopefully we see the continuation of the story before long.",4.5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,By far one of the most frustrating animes out there. Don't stop in the middle of it because some parts can be depressive as hell. Either way it has a good story and an unique-ish concept. Hopefully it could get a 2nd season or perhaps a single movie as it still has many ties to connect at the end and you're left inarticulate wondering where the rest of it is. However I doubt they could continue making it even more frustrating as it has been going up from start to finish. Which mean that they would have to come up with a new concept which could either revive or kill the series like in the 2nd series of Sword Art Online where (Spoiler) they weren't at the threat of death at every point which made it rather... Non-serious?,4.5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"The show started out great, and made me love the characters.  Then...Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideAs time went on Subaru's Emilia obsession just got annoying.  His madness got to the point where the episodes weren't enjoyable, but a chore to endure, and then after episode 18 I just wanted to punch him repeatedly.  I ended up watching the show because I enjoyed the supporting and side characters much more than the MC. #PunchSubaru",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"This is a very good anime that is severely hindered by a MC that responds to any situation with only two types of responses. If you can forgive that, then this anime is definitely worth watching. The story and animation is great. The background is well developed. You'll end up liking even the side characters in the story. The authors of these stories really have to stop making every character like Cloud from FF7. Even whiny people, when they go through such hardship as Subaru does, will grow up and develop. Nobody stays the same. If you want to see a good example of how a ""weak"" character can be developed to become important, read Lord of the Rings or watch the movie. You don't have to sabotage their development as people to keep them humble. He does seem to develop slowly, but at a really, really slow pace.",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"Concerning just the production of the anime itself, I loved the art style and characters! There was also a unique balance they struck between the bloody violence and the cutesy scenes; overall a fantastic anime, except... Somewhere around the 12th episode or so you grow to hate the protagonist more than is healthy. The series felt like it was falling apart all the way until the last few episodes; once the protagonist finally sees the err in his ways and the ending story wraps-up, you remember why you fell in-love with the series to begin with. So except for the agonizing stretch of episodes where you grow beyond resentment and resort to a burning hate for the protagonist, this is an incredible overall anime.",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"Current market has so much Isekai that one needs to do something seriously original to stand out from this whole crowd.Here we have main character called Subaru, who despite being called to RPG-like world remains ""normal guy"". As in every anime he has this one strange ability differing him from humans we see every day on the streets, but what stands out is that this ability is absolutely useless in any combat/physical conflict. But also this ability helps him correct his mistakes to some extent... and that element is used perfectly.Subaru is really childish at the beginning of the series. In my opinion his development is the greatest part of this anime, which can be completely missed on the first watch. I decided to watch Re:zero once again - something I don't do very often with anime. I just know that now, knowing social background of characters and direction they will take, this anime will have additional dimension which can be explored.",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"After being suddenly thrown into some kind of fantasy world, Subaru Natsuki is caught between many conflicts and tragedies that he is unable to escape, for some reason he is always reincarnated back to these painful events shortly after his death. It is up to him alone to try to tip the scales of fate in his favor, time and time again. Determined not just for a happy ending, but for a ending of the chaos around him.Re:ZERO is to blame for all the crappy isekai anime we have been getting lately, that I believe to be fact. For the most part though, that is Re:ZERO's only flaw, that it is so good that others are trying way too hard to achieve what Re:ZERO has achieved. With strong writing, fantastic animation, and some of the most beloved anime characters to date. Re:ZERO is what I regard to be one of the best anime of our generation, and I highly look forward to it's return, whenever that may be.",5
rezero-starting-life-in-another-world-,"This became my favorite anime in seconds (literally). I usually don't really watch anime (the only ones that I have watched before this are: Ginga Nagareboshi Gin, Ginga Densetsu Weed, some of the Studio Ghibli animes, Hellsing Ultimate, Persona 3 and 4 animations, One Punch Man and Mob Psycho 100. But I decided to check this anime out, and I was not disappointed. Everything in this anime was perfect, all the characters, story and animation was great! This was just so freaking cool, that I can't even put it into words, how much I like this anime.-Temetsu_98",5
jojos-bizarre-adventure,"Jojo's Bizarre Adventure is a curious case, being immensely popular in Japan but only releasing one of its 8 arcs stateside in the entirety of its ongoing 27 year run, and even then only ever having an OVA and a Movie released outside of the manga for the first 25. The brave souls at David Production attempted to adapt this monster of a series, and their efforts were not wasted. The first 2 arcs, Phantom Blood and Battle Tendency, are covered in the first season of the anime, and the creators made sure that the story stayed true to the events and style of the source material. Hirohiko Araki's dramatic style of illustrating sound effects is translated beautifully into the colorful and stylistic world of Jojo, and the plot doesn't stray from the manga like it does in the OVA and Movie. For authenticity alone I give this series a 5/5, but I really enjoy the content within as well and I implore that you give it a try as well. It's not a juggernaut without a reason after all.EDIT: Crunchyroll's subtitles have done a good job preserving the references to other media within the confines of copyright law, which is exciting as a new fan of the series.",5
jojos-bizarre-adventure,"I just finished a marathon of the first season in preparation for the upcoming second, and I could not stop watching. The action is incredible and the story and characters are absolutely ridiculous. Everything about this show is crazy and over the top but at the same time it has a compelling and addictive story.The title says it all really: this is a show that is in equal parts bizarre and adventurous.",5
jojos-bizarre-adventure,"I went into this series wondering, ""Why does everyone love that JoJo anime so much?"" It looked so odd to me. The character designs were weird, the gifs made no sense, and everything about it just screamed, well, bizarre.I finally gave in and began watching JJBA -- and I was forever changed.I totally recommend this anime, as you will love it. It seriously just gets better and better, and your love for the story and the characters deepen with each episode. JJBA is truly an experience. It's an adventure (obviously) and plays out very excitingly, I was never bored.This anime is the first anime I've watched all the way through that has, like, more than 20 episodes. I almost never get hooked on an anime like this, which really says something about how special it is.It took me about 2 months to catch up to where the series is now, and within that time span I have bought JJBA posters, stickers, and I even cosplayed a fem!Jotaro Kujo. That's how far gone I am.So if you are like I once was, wondering what in the world could be SO GOOD about the people named JoJo and their wacky outfits - I ask you to give it a try. You won't be disappointed.",5
jojos-bizarre-adventure,"Alright, so let me begin with just saying that if you look for new shows like I do, a lot of you are probably sitting on the fence right now, looking for a unique reason to watch this particular little title. Let me just stop you right there and say, if you're looking for something truly memorable, something that really makes an impression, something that lasts, then I'd recommend you go ahead and start that first episode right now! If you're not convinced, keep reading. You will be. ;)Now, there are some very large plot points in the show that are consistent throughout, although you may or may not consider them to be rather large spoilers, so only read this section if you don't think you'd mind that.  Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideThe show consists of different, semi-short (around 10 episode from what we've seen so far) arcs, however, each story arc revolves around a different character, all of them being descendents of the Joestar (That's right you heard me), Joestar family. As such the show takes place in different time periods and different parts of the world each arc. Now, a lot of you people are probably thinking ""But Electric0eye-sempai, how can we grow to love a character in only 10 or 20 episodes only for them to be replaced?"" In such case, you'd be right to ask! However! I guarantee that you will grow to love every new character just as much as the last, and within only an episode or two of them appearing! Now with the nasty business of spoilers out of the way, let me also try to define the genre of this shining star for you. If you can imagine Fist of the North Star buying Hellsing Ultimate a drink, going steady, and having a beautiful baby boy, then the animation of this show is more or less the result. As such, every character is pretty much the pinnacle of masculinity to extents you rarely see these days. And trust me, if that's not your thing it will be before long after watching this show. Because with it's gorgeous animation and unique artstyle comes some other tropes, one of which being poses. If you've seen Hellsing Ultimate you probably know what I'm talking about, how you can pause the show at pretty much any point and be met with wallpaper material, imagine that times 20, in which every main character makes a point to pose when doing literally anything, with much appreciated flair. The action is awesome, even to ridiculous levels.  Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideSuch as one of the main characters literally walking up the side of a wall, casually striding as his feet crash into the wall with each step.So if you like your action over-easy, then trust me, I think you'll get a kick out of this. (I'm sorry). The show is also fairly violent, but more in a Hellsing Ultimate zombie-head-smashy kind of way, you might find it pretty hardcore at times if you're not used to animated violence, but if you sat through Hellsing Ultimate or anything of equal measure trust me, you'll be just fine.So that's pretty much it, the short and long version of why you should watch JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. I wrote this because I'd feel too ashamed knowing how much I enjoy this show and not taking the time to share it, so please, enjoy at your leisure. If you haven't yet, then go hit that play button. Trust me, you won't regret it.",5
jojos-bizarre-adventure,"Classic. Dramatic. Revered. Niche.JoJo does it all — with style. Besides the absurd amount of cultural references both eastern and western JoJo's ground-breaking success in Japan should speak for itself.Until recently the only thing keeping it from being successfully publicized in the west is the author's love of western music, which is translated into various namesakes through the series.",5
jojos-bizarre-adventure,"I need to say that JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is one of the most amazing series that I have been able to watch lately. It's story and excitement for each and every episode just keeps the watchers entertained until they are going to watch through the whole series, and even possibly start with Manga if they are unable to wait any longer for new episodes.StorylineThe story, as many of you may have already noticed, is mainly focused around the Joestar bloodline as they struggle to battle their nemesis DIO!!. Each part of the story has always something to do with him, and so, it's quite interesting to see how the story intervines with these two. JoJo's Bizarre Adventure has a story in which even the main character can die, as seen with the first part - Phantom Blood. I would rate the story top-notch, with many interesting twists, and so on.Review The one thing I love the most about JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is the way the characters battle their opponents. They don't do it simply through plot-armor, and stuff like that, but they actually use their brain to fight. Many of the opponents even think logically, and tend to be geniuses which provide the characters they battle with great struggles.Furthermore, in order to win a fight, a character always needs to use the full potential of their Stands and powers in order to defeat the opponent. And that's mostly why I love the action in JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. That action is also supported by the epic punch-lines, excitement, and unpredictability which comes from it.Another thing I love about the series is that no matter what gender the main character is, the mascunality just sky-rockets off the walls with their actions and ambitions. In the series, you will meet many heart-breaking and heart-warming times with several characters shedding manly tears at times!All in all, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is something you need to watch, and you need to watch every part, read manga, everything that has to do with it. It is time well-spent, trust me, I am a doctor.",5
jojos-bizarre-adventure,"I was only 16 years old. I loved JoJo so much, I had all the merchandise and blu-rays. I'd pray to Araki every night before I go to bed, thanking for the life I've been given. ""JoJo is love"", I would say, ""JoJo is life"". My dad hears me and calls me a faggot. I knew he was just jealous for my devotion of JoJo. I called him a cunt. He slaps me and sends me to go to sleep. I'm crying now and my face hurts. I lay in bed and it's really cold. A warmth is moving towards me. I feel something touch me. It's Jotaro. I'm so happy. He whispers in my ear, ""Sabaku no wa ore no stando da!"". He grabs me with his powerful Star Platinum hands, and puts me on my hands and knees. I spread my ass-cheeks for Jotaro. He penetrates my butthole. It hurts so much, but I do it for Jotaro. I can feel my butt tearing as my eyes start to water. I push against his force. I want to please Jotaro. He roars a mighty roar, as he fills my butt with his love. My dad walks in. Jotaro looks him straight in the eye, and says, ""Yare Yare Daze"". Jotaro leaves through my window. JoJo is love. JoJo is life.﻿",5
jojos-bizarre-adventure,"Jojo's Bizarre Adventure is a fusion of satire and typical shonen. Many of the one to three star reviewers seem to believe the show is stereotypically shonen, like Bleach or Naruto. Hirohiko Araki, the creator, made Jojo to parody the hyper masculine series that ruled the anime genre in the 80's, namely Fist of the North Star. While people are calling it sexist they miss out on the fact that half the cast is wearing overly flamboyant clothing and striking poses that would make a Victoria's Secret model do a double take. Here are hyper masculine men, six feet tall, built like walls, posing like they're Catwoman on the cover of a Frank Miller comic book.This all isn't to say the show doesn't also revel in its roots. Of course there's going to be shonen action, that's how they contrast the posing, art style, and character actions. For some people it's plodding and I get that, but the people saying this ""makes Bleach look elegant"" simply have no idea. And I don't mean that offensively, I mean they quit before they could realize what the series is about. If you like a good laugh, over the top villains with over the top heroes in overly climactic battles that constantly raise the stakes to ludicrous proportions, with some decent nudge nudge wink wink trope comedy, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is what you want.",5

Puts JoJo ahead of even Dragon Ball (you know that the Z fighters will win 90% of the time)+ Spectacular soundtrack+ Follows a bloodline of badasses- Part 1 is an obstacle for new watchers, as it's boring, and not as good as the rest of the series.",5

The Third Part thats currently being aired had such an amazing start. For some reason it feels like the blood, and gore gets much more bloodier as the show goes on, but as I re-watched the show with some of my family I realized that the blood and gore is a signature trait for the JoJo Series. I love where this series is going, and it truly feels like an adventure because after the first season there are many places they travel to, and they always keep moving. There has been no dull episodes, any episode with little action usually has some important dialogue to introduce to the plot. I honestly believe this and Hunter x Hunter are the CURRENTLY hypest shows on Crunchyroll. I started reading the manga on my own accord, and did not regret it.

I recently read the manga, and after doing so I found it hard to understand how It was the same jojo sires part after part? it had the same concepts, but how the stories are written are completely altered as while part 3 is an adventure packed with nonstop action, the 8th part can hardly be classified as action and is more of a mystery tale that's occasional battles feel like a Zelda boss with a puzzle like nature . The anime adaptation has been brilliant so far, properly adding the pizzaz and style intended by the creator and being able to properly adapt the storys well also. if you choose to pass on this sires, then you don't have any clue what you are missing.",5
jojos-bizarre-adventure,"Jojo's Bizarre Adventure is a manga series that started way back in 1987, and took it until 2012 to get an anime adaptation that Hirohiko Araki, the author, actually liked. The story is about a chain of events that spans hundreds of years that start when the villainous Dio Brando shows up at Jonathan Joestar's house in England and makes a mess out of his life. That doesn't sound very bizarre, but Dio manages to become a vampire, and starts trying to take over the world for no good reason. That's only part one of the currently eight-part series, but so far only parts 1, 2, and 3 have been animated. Onto the actual review: Jojo's Bizarre Adventure is characterized by it's unique, quirky nature and well-thought out fights. The animation might be merely okay, but it is put off by the colorful and extravagant artstyle of the anime. Part 1 is very short, but it's key setup for what's to come in Part 3. Part 2 follows Jonathan's grandson, Joseph, as he fights nearly naked Aztec Vampire men with dubstep theme songs. Part 3 might be the most famous, and it explores Jotaro--Joseph's grandson--and his efforts to travel to Egypt from Japan in order to defeat a mysterious individual who is responsible for his mother getting an incurable fever. Also Part 3 introduces ""Stands"", manifestations of spirits who fight alongside their users.The soundtrack also works amazingly well with the setting, and a different composer males different music for each part. Part 1 takes place in 1880's England, so the music is very orchestral and fancy. Part 2 is in the 1930's and Joseph travels all over the place, so the music tries to fit his personality: laid-back, yet knows when to get going. Speaking of personality, the characters have very simple personalities for the most part, and the focus is more on the fights, the story, and the adventure of it all.Definitely check this out if you're looking for a serious yet weird fighting series with high energy and enjoyability, but can mind if the characters can be a bit shallow. In parts 1-2, the characters not named Jojo or Zeppeli barely even do anything other than narrate! But if you like a mostly linear series, than be warned that Part 3 isn't necessarily very linear, except in the sense that it's just a series of fights with a journey to Egypt from Japan in the background. The fights are very entertaining and creative, though. And those issues surrounding Part 3 and how it seems like a grind at some moments might be fixed in the (at the time, upcoming) anime.",5

jojos-bizarre-adventure,"I could gush on how much I love JoJo, and I really, really do, however, after conducting a short survey of all these reviews, I've figured out how newcomers should watch this anime. Try to push through Part 1. Yes, I know it can seem to be cliched, but keep in mind that JoJo's Bizarre Adventures wrote a lot of those cliches to begin with. By the time you reach the end of Part 1 (Episode 9), you would have either fallen in love (which makes this review redundant), absolutely hated it (that's okay, you can leave saying you gave it a shot), or, if you were like me; you haven't found your true love in anime form, but you wouldn't be opposed to watching a little more (just to see were it's all going). If you are in the last category, do your best to push through Part 2. Part 2 will be the part that makes or breaks this anime for you. Hell, you can walk away from this show after Part 2 feeling pretty satisfied, whether or not you decide to watch Part 3. For me, it created an obsession that I may never get over. My highest recommendations.",5
jojos-bizarre-adventure,"This is one of the funniest and coolest anime I know at the moment. Seeing these macho characters at it in their fights is truly a work of arts. Their voices and are really entertaining, as you follow the story of the JoJo family bloodline, they are all very badass main characters. The character development is very interesting and each season has almost a completely different feel in terms of their battles, but always very interesting.Definitely worth a watch.",5
jojos-bizarre-adventure,"I just got into this anime a week ago and I've all ready completely all three season and now waiting for the four one to come out. This is the greatest anime I've ever seen! It has everything you could want comedy, action, posing, blood, and like everything you can think of and it does it in a way that makes it all work out somehow. I will say however don't just go in and base it off the first one or two episodes. The anime does take sometime to really kick into gear but one it does you're going to be in for a ride. Like I said before I just got into this show and I'm talking about it to all of my friends and telling them to watch it just like I am telling you, the reader. You just need to go in and watch it. Watch it to at least the second half of the first season it gets better in the second half. So just go already. Why are you still here? GOOO!!!!",5
jojos-bizarre-adventure,"I've picked this anime after a friend suggested it. The first episode was good enough for me to keep watching. You get hooked to this universe rather fast. It grows on you, and you fall in love with it. I know it's really over the top most of the time, but that's what I like about it. Every episode is something new and exciting. Music is on point, animation is on point. Possibly one of the best anime shows I've seen in a while. I recommend that you give it try. Following the Joestar family is probably one of the best decisions I've ever made.",5
jojos-bizarre-adventure,"The less you know about JoJo's Bizarre Adventure going into it, the better.Start with the first episode of the first arc.  You won't know exactly what to think at first.  The plot elements, the designs, and the hyper-masculinity all seem like they were taken from another time, and in fact they were.JoJo's Bizarre Adventure has unique intensity that never lets up, even when things get, well, BIZARRE. The plot starts out relatively mundane but quickly escalates in a way that stretches and then threatens to snap suspension of disbelief. You might at times think you're watching a parody, but while JJBA is very often funny, it is also deadly serious action.The characters are all relatively simple but enjoyable.  Everything is turned up to 11, the pure evil of the villains, the manly virtues of the heroes, the clothing, the poses, the action, the music.  JoJo has a prog rock spirit that never quits and a unique style that has been referenced countless times by other series.  You'll find yourself wanting to watch more long before you ""get"" it, and then ""it"" changes yet again.I for one hope that the ride never ends, I've enjoyed every minute.",5
jojos-bizarre-adventure,"Unlike any anime I have ever seen. Just the art style combined with the unique storytelling and fantastic fights. Each episode I looked forward to, as I just went through a huge marathon with the series. Can't wait for the new season this month. Absolutely incredible. I would highly recommend. One of my favorite series.Plus, this motivated me to go back to the gym, out of envy. Like in the title, the show is just the essence of manliness. If I owned a gym, I would constantly be playing this show on all the TVs. Don't believe me/think I'm crazy? Watch the show.",5
jojos-bizarre-adventure,"When I first start watching this anime I was a little skeptical.  I knew the manga had a big following but wasn't sure how the execution of this was going to go.  Well let me tell you one thing, they did a FANTASTIC JOB.  The anime is the perfect combination of Manliness and Poses.  It's a story that you'll love,  You instantly get addicted to the animation style and the voice acting is spot on.  There's nothing more I can say about this.  It's become one of my favorites easily.  I would rate JoJo's Bizarre Adventure a 10/10.  Definitely a must watch if you enjoy anime, great stories, and poses.",5
jojos-bizarre-adventure,"JoJo's Bizarre Adventure starts off with a premise of Johnathan Joestar's conflict with his stepbrother, Dio Brando. Leading from Victorian-era England all of the way up to the currently adapted part of the anime, Stardust Crusaders.JoJo's is a rather likeable series due to the cast of characters and the events during the plot that unfold. It's somewhat of a tour de force to really enjoy from beginning to end. I feel that the series as a whole animated is beautifully done, and I really hope to see the further parts post Stardust Crusaders animated. I highly, highly recommend this series due to the amazing world of Hirohito Araki being fleshed out and animated on the television screen. It's one of the legendary mangas of our time, and I hope we get to see more as time passes on.",5
jojos-bizarre-adventure,"I call this a MANime.. manly anime. I'm not saying its for guys because I'm a chick and love this type of series, its more of same vein as series like Beserk, bastard, etc. I instantly loved the series though the artwork took some getting use to, the SC season has grown on me. Only because I didn't like Jotaro as much as I liked Joseph, but serious this is such a fun anime to watch. Few series in the last couple years have gotten me as excited and anxious to watch them  like when I first got into anime, and this is one of them. its just a fun, great series.. with some cool problem solving Elements Great music too! *lick*lick*lick*lick*lick*lick*lick*",5
jojos-bizarre-adventure,"I would recommend this for men seeking a role model of sheer manliness. At the same time, I would recommend this anime for girls looking for some serious ""eye candy,"" since this anime is overflowing with very robust healthy young men. Besides all the external glamour, this anime is comprised of a very captivating story line along with a adrenaline rush of very gory action scenes. Be advised, there will be zombies, vampires, a Man killing robot, beautiful women, and very handsome looking men in this anime. Brace yourself for one heck of a ""bizarre"" adventure.",5
jojos-bizarre-adventure,"The legendary manga created by the legendary mangaka Hirohiko Araki finally receives an anime adaptation! JoJo's Bizarre Adventure arguably the most influential manga of all time. Moreso than Dragon Ball! It isn't merely it's gorgeous artwork that makes it shine, but it's also the diverse storytelling it has. Each arc has a new main character with a new storyline in order to keep the series fresh. The first arc is a Victorian Gothic horror, but later on the second arc has the air of a light-hearted action flick. The third is an epic adventure that combines Journey to the West with Bram Stoker's Dracula. The fourth a Persona-ish hunt for supernatural criminals in a small Japanese town, the fifth an Italian mafia war, the sixth a jailbreak story, the seventh a horseback race across the continental United States, and the eighth a supernatural mystery following the destruction left by the 2011 Touhoku EarthquakeNot only do I highly recommend the manga, but this anime series presented by David Production is one of the most faithful adaptations of a manga that I have ever seen. You can tell that the production team and each of the seiyuu who are a part of this production grew up with JoJo and are hellbent and making an anime that does the series justice.In short, JoJo is awesome. Now WATCH IT!",5
jojos-bizarre-adventure,just. yes.i decided i finally needed to write a review so uhi'd really just like to say that the bad reviews don't make sense?? saying that jojo is boring and has no character development is completely false &&& i guarantee that anyone who disagrees with me hasn't even watched the first season in its entirety. give it time!! sometimes you need to get pretty far into a show before you really start to enjoy and appreciate it (:,5
jojos-bizarre-adventure,"Jojos bizarre adventure will take on a roller coaster or experiences from amazing and some times sad and serious. The level of writing and creativity the series undergoes continues to increase in quality as you progress through the parts. The powers and action of the show cannot be done justice in just words but ill try. Battles are very entertaining and will sometimes blow you away.Definitely one of the most unique shows here on this site, but it isn't for everyone. One major downside of the show is the inconsistency of the original writer Hirohiko Araki. In the original manga especially in the later parts, his writing style can get unpredictable and random. Which can make or break moments in the show, for the most part, it makes it. But when doesn't it sticks out, and it's even more noticeable in the anime. This is not the fault of david productions but rather Araki himself.",5
jojos-bizarre-adventure,"This show took my life away from me.I mean it, there is no show like it or any that come even close. The fights are amazing, each one is packed with un-raveling the enemies abilities and strengths. Once you get through the first 9 episodes, you cant stop. If u rlly rlly rlly cant bear the first or second parts (I happen to love part 2 bc Joseph is amazing but part 1 can be boring) you could, but I warn you not to cause you are really missing a lot, skip to part 3. If you even tell any jojo fan about this, they will MUDA MUDA you to death because u are now a part skipper. But for real, watch this anime its so amazing in every way. The character development is amazing, the fights are amazing. THE POSES ARE EVEN AMAZING. It is truly bizarre how good this is.",5

jojos-bizarre-adventure,"The series evolves as Araki realizes what works and what doesn’t, as such there are some issues you may have with different parts.Part 1 Phantom Blood, the first 9 episodes, will cause a lot of people to stumble because it’s generic in ways,  the constant descriptions of people’s attacks, and the way characters are drawn is a little too masculine for most, but I highly encourage watching all 9 episodes (even if it’s after watching other parts) because it lays the foundation of the series.Part 2 Battle Tendency, is much better for most people. The characters are still piles of pure muscle, but the fights feel more exciting, Hamon is expanded upon and Joseph feels a lot more clever than Jonathan. This part is what caused me to become a JoJo fan.Part 3 Stardust Crusaders is where I struggled a bit, the introduction of stands messed me up. It went from being manly men punching each other to stands punching each other. Stand were a new thing so Araki didn’t really know what to do with them yet so many of them were essentially “punching ghosts”. Again I recommend continuing with this part even if you find it not to be for you since you’ll be more used to stands and I honestly enjoyed the part when it was over.Part 4 Diamond is Unbreakable, this is where Araki makes stands much more interesting. Without spoiling too much I’ll give the Main character’s stand ability and a side character’s stand ability  Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideMain JoJo’s stand can fix things and a side character can make people feel an unbearable weight of guilt if they think they’ve wronged him. these are very different from what we saw in part 3 even if JoJo is still using a stand that feels like a punching ghost at times. We also see a lot more of “attack the stand user” rather than the stand. So even if the character is attacking with their stand, they are still fighting as far as we the audience are concerned.Part 5 Golden Wind is where we see Araki’s art style become much more defined, and of course, stands continue to be very interesting. It’s the most popular part in Japan and I don’t think there’s much I need to say on how it feels enjoyable to watch or read.Part 6 Stone Ocean is not adapted into an anime as of my writing this but I’ll leave a comment on it. This is the first and probably only female JoJo, and it’s an interesting change of pace. I don’t think the part was bad, but I feel like it could have been better, some fights did suffer from the over description issue. Part 7 Steel Ball Run is the part I am currently reading. So far I have found it rather enjoyable as it feels so wildly different from the previous parts. Stands feel almost like hamon abilities in this part, which makes me very happy. It also feels like a remake of Phantom Blood in a way since it shares many character names despite being so different.Part 8 JoJolion obviously I have no comment as of yet.",5

that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"As a big fan of isekai shows, I have succumb my self to a lot of trashy ones. Among the harems and OP thick headed MCs, there are several that stand out as legitimately good shows. Shows like Overlord and Konosuba stand out because they break the standard tropes of isekai, which brings me to this show. That Time I Got Reincarnated As A Slime or TIGRAS for short, despite seemingly a harem show actually really isn't. The manga was very focused on the world building and how Rimuru would change how monsters and humans would live. This gives a realistic sense of how one would try to create a peaceful world of monsters and men. I love the low key message of braking racial barriers in order to create a utopia. With a good story that's basically the opposite of Overlord, the manga made the world of TIGRAS seem more alive than a lot of other isekai. Also the action scenes were badass in the manga so I can't wait to see them in the show.",4.5

that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"The Isekai (or ""In another world"") genre isn't new to anyone that's been watching anime for any length of time. Every season there's always at least two new spins on the popular genre, most of them adding nothing new or interesting to what already exists.Slime Datta Ken (or ""Reincarnated as a Slime"") changes up the existing formula quickly. Whereas some of the normal Isekai tropes exist, they are often used differently to other shows.As a quick example to show this, most Isekai protagonists gain extraordinary power or unique skills in order to put them on the level of some kind of ""Hero"" which then allows them to take on a demon lord, conquer the world, or laugh in the face of any competition. Slime Datta Ken gives us a protagonist that gains these powers, but instead of doing anything like previous protagonists of the genre, his only goal is to create a city/country that is safe for those monsters that have been abused for so long.Perhaps I'm not giving the plot justice with that statement. But I do urge you, whomever decides to read any of this, to give this show the ""3 Episode"" treatment. Just watch the first three episodes, if you're not hooked just move on (until someone inevitably tells you that ""it gets a lot better!"").-- I give the plot a solid 5/5 --That said. For those that care about other background ambiance:The animation is crisp, almost everything is drawn, and CGI is used sparingly on background scenery that you could only notice if you're trying.The music and sound choice is fantastic and really fits into the tone of the show. I don't think I have anything else to say about it.That said, I do think that the OP perhaps spoils a bit too much given that much of the stuff it shows probably won't be happening until its second cour (13th-24th episodes).-- I give the animation and sound designs a 4.5/5And that's why I gave this show a 5/5.I urge anyone reading this to give this show a chance, it won't disappoint you.",5
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"I have read the manga and light novel for a very long time so when I heard about this series getting an anime I was very excited! I have spent my morning being bored with nothing to watch or do and now that this has come I can enjoy watching anime again and it's a funny enjoyable adventure. The beginning was exciting and had 'life' or motion in it's detail of events. What's more the coloring is bright and colorful which fits the art style and the story events so far have been following the novel and the animation didn't cut out critical details which are necessary for the animation to be able to tell it's story properly. What's even more exciting and making me give a 5 star is that the animation has brought 'Emotion' or movement into the characters the way they express themselves are smooth and fit their development as character personality. The action they preform are not cut or short but detailed and you can tell what they are feeling and understand it without needing insight to it. Especially the Slime Rimuru! The animation was spot on with giving emotion to a mass of gelatin and actually made him seem adorable and life like! Its a great way to express his emotions and actions! The storyboard is also quite well done as the story line is following the details of the story line without cutting out to critical details which carries most of the intent of the story and this expresses clearly! The story wasn't moved at a rapid pace and lost many details which make it fun, but instead kept the story telling details,which as a novel reader of this series personally enjoy, but the animation gave movement to the character and gave 'body' to it's character with personality, movement of his or her expression, and keeping the setting and expression of it's environment and coloring it's a really enjoyable anime! I hope this animation continues on for a long time and I hope they keep up this quality of animation! It's getting more popular over time and with this animation style, story telling without being rushed, art with emotion and expression, and the effort and time they put into this series, I'm sure that many people will be re watching this series and enjoy the new episodes for many Episodes to come! My only hope is that it will have a large enough fan base for the animation company to continue this series and give more seasons for the fans to enjoy and MOST IMPORTANTLY! To keep the quality of the animation, and story telling as it is in the first 3 episodes I have seen so far!",5
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"I haven't written a review before, and its especially odd to pick a show with just one episode so far as a starting point, but man am I exited for this one! The movement and animation for the characters have been very fluid and well executed, and the story is really neat and interesting too. As it is commonly known, slime are just low-level, easily defeated monsters in most any rpg, but having one be sentient and knowledgeable and having cool skills? That is cool enough in its own right. Combined with the animation so far, I just have to say, I'm excited for this one.",5
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"This anime nails everything that is interesting about issekai.1.) Starting premise is tragically believable, based on a dying wish.2.) The protagonist's dying wish is answered and they start an amazing adventure in an honest and simple way.3.) The pace of adding characters is spot on with good introductions, although I'd love to know a bit more about the Ogres.4.) Animation is excellent.5.) Touching connections to humanity in our world.6.) The antagonist is dark and shrouded at the moment, so I love learning about them along with the protagonist. I'm hoping for something more than a good guy/bad guy plot, and a bitter-sweet ending would totally be in theme for this anime. Even if the bad guy is an uncomplicated bad guy for the sake of being bad, the journey has been so fun this far, I could totally overlook it.7.) Slimes are finally having their day in the sun!!!!!!! Someone finally recognized how versatile slimes could be, mixed in with a little intelligence and BOOM! So awesome!! Would love to actually play a video game like this.I could keep going.",5
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"I mean it just is.  It's an enjoyable show for what it is, but at the end of the day it's nothing memorable and it doesn't have much rewatch value to it at all.It starts out with a really interesting premise of what's essentially a loser in our world being reincarnated as the weakest monster of another world, then immediately shoots that premise in the foot at the end of the first episode.  Rimuru immediately turns into slime jesus/mary sue incarnate as he goes around the world facing hyped up threats that always end with anticlimactic resolutions.  The high production values make it a fun watch regardless, but nothing ever goes wrong for Rimuru since he has the ""Great Sage"" to fill him in on anything he doesn't know.  The show has a really lighthearted feel to most of it which makes it a real easy watch, but it can be hard to hold the interest of some when there is basically no tension or conflict whatsoever.- It tries to position itself as a civilization development show at times, but then Rimuru doesn't do much in regards to doing so as it just.....happens.- It tries to position itself as a show that supports diplomacy, but it represents a level of political structure that a 10 year old might have an understanding of.  (Seriously, any threatening enemy just turns into a friend almost immediately)- It tries to position itself as an action show at times, but most fights devolve into onesided curbstomps with long foregone conclusions.  - It tries to position itself as a show with rich characters, but most characters are one-dimensional trope fulfillment mannequins as if the writer was going down a checklist.At the time of this review the main story has finished, which is why I waited to say anything about it.  I know that many of the novel readers are trying to hype up a second season saying that things get ""Dark""....but it really doesn't.  As a novel reader I can say that this is a story that was never meant to take itself too seriously, which is rather unfortunate that past volume 5 (Past the timeline of the anime) it then retroactively tries to start taking itself seriously, which comes off as REALLY dumb.It's an enjoyable show for what it is, and it is certainly worth the initial viewing.  Just don't go in expecting a riveting ongoing plot and a fully fleshed out cast, because it just doesn't happen.",5
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"It is a good anime. I wish there was more to the story and not so much easily seen foreshadowing. Many of the plot points can be seen an episode or two in advance. The story is really rushed and there is no character development. I would have to say this is a decent anime. The characters seem to be general stereotypes. The irony is that it points it out and to minor comedic effect. I would say this is an anime for a younger audience age range 6-15. The one question i have is why did he not run into other slimes.The animation is great and matches the target age group. It is a show i would be okay watching with a family around. I found most of the art work to be spot on. Over all it would be something I wouldn't mind watching it. I would give a 3.25 if I could, 3 is a little harsh but 4 is a bit too much.",5
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"I loved this anime.... until I didn't. In the beginning this anime did a lot of things correctly. This anime created a cool and interesting world. We as an audience learned about the world as Rimuru learned about the word. The anime also had some side slice of life stuff that all leads to an interesting mid season finale. Now with the new characters added in, it makes for a boring show. The tension and purpose is gone.  Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideWhen you introduce less powerful demon lords that Rimuru easily handles the story becomes pointless. Also Rimuru has little to no competition after he beats the first demon lord.   Would recommend till the mid season finale. After that episode it feels like the author lost all direction.",5
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"A show where a character (Rimiru) dies in the real world and is reborn in another one as a slime, the classic RPG monster. This character begins their journey by becoming incredibly powerful and gathering the tools necessary to overcome the challenges presented to them. They go on to help the world form into a larger, more peaceful society that reflects Rimiru's great deeds.The animation quality is excellent, and there is a markedly high amount of inventive world-building, which is executed very well.However, this show has very little tension, drama, or conflict. This is done on purpose. The characters are heavy-handed to an unrealistic degree, in comparison to the protagonist, whose personality is not developed enough to create a conflict - and, in turn, neither are any of the other characters'. When the small, or even large issues do arise, they are solved by the protagonist in an immediate and simple way.A story needs a conflict, and this one is built not to have it. There is a lack of substance here that is accepted at face value, which is absolutely baffling as an experienced writer. A poor conflict makes a bad story, but no conflict makes for no story, not a good one. Don't get confused.",5
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"Sometimes you feel like you might be Isekai'ed out but the reason there are so many of them is that if done right, they can be great. This show is done right.It has all the troups, and it plays them more or less straight. It's not a parody like Konosuba but manages to remind everyone why we loved this genre in the first place. It's a fun entertaining romp through a fantasy Isekai with a lovable cast of characters, great voice acting, and awesome animation.This anime is a reminder that execution is key. You don't always need to be a completely original never before seen edge of storytelling. If you can execute well you can have a great entertaining anime.",4.5
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"""That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime"" comes across as a typical OP main character fantasy anime at a glance and granted it is to a degree, but the way they handle the power of Rimuru is very alike that of Ainz in Overlord. His power isn't his defining characteristic but his interactions with the various other characters is. The show has a way of making you invested in the characters quite quickly which is why it is one of my favorite of the season. It is one of the reasons I look forward to Monday mornings and im always excited to see what happens next, whether the episode is action packed or slow it has a way of gluing your eyes to the screen and hyping up the following episode. Hopefully the show continues for a long time as I am excited to see where the story goes!",4.5
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"I rarely find myself completely invested in an anime, I fall behind and then just give up on too many shows.  But this one I was in love from episode 1 and binge-watched all that were available, only to be depressed when I caught up.  I fell in love with everything about this.  The wide variety of lovable, complex characters most of whom get some kind of back story and character evolution.  But the story doesn't stray too far away from the main protagonist, Rimura, who despite definitely being an over-powered characters stays likable and down-to-earth.  Well done.  I hope this anime continues on the same path that the first 10 episodes have (exciting, heart-warming and funny) and it will be one my my all-time favorites ever.",5
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"Japan has given us many of these kind of mangas and animes, But this here perfects the formula. Main character is low-key OP, likable, actually smart instead of ""dumb everyone else down smart"" and the world has interesting approach to fantasy tropes.The characters are varied and vivid in their own personalities, even the moeblob to come has actual personality to them. This show needs more love, because no amount of love is enough for this heartwarming tale of intrigue.",2
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"all in all, its not that bad of a show. however, every bad guy becomes a good guy, each battle has no stakes, and the main character + companions are unbeatable warlords, they certainly don't handle the power as well as other shows, like Overlord, after 16 it feels like ideas started to run out. all in all its not a bad show, but it certainly isn't the best. Its enjoyable to watch, but some people may get tired of it quick enough.",3
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,so imma be real this show is straight gang weed until 2.74/4th of the way though because you realize that aint nothing happening to these god/anime powered supa guys. you also got some jailbait in there which i guess is a plus for some people. but you kinda realize no ones gonna die when they yeet that flying fish faster than the final boss of diablo III after i convinced that guy to give me his hacked gear. im not even playing i told him that blizzard knew he hacked and were waiting until he had a high level to ban him and i said i could fix it. worked on 3/5 people i tried it with but yeah back to the review. its got some absolutly hilarious scenes where ya man chad gabiru finna talk to the champ like mcgregor and gets destroyed like the final boss of diable three after i stole some guys hacked loot. 4/5 because no one died but that one person,3
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"After watching all but the Veldora Journal episode (yes I've read them and yes they're pretty hilarious) I can say this show is perfectly average and great if you want an easy watch to unwind after a long day. Beyond that... ehhhhhh...The premise of the show is great and the first episode really got me hooked. I thought the concept of a person from another world bumbling his way around the new one as a simple slime was fun and interesting and left a lot of room for growth. I was definitely right about it being fun, but that's about it, and that's why this show gets 3 stars. It's not bad or boring enough to be below average, but it's definitely not interesting or clever enough to be above average. And so here it is, as I said before, perfectly average. My biggest problem with the show is that it really doesn't do anything with the concept it starts with. There is SO much room for character growth and development at the beginning but there's the same amount of room at the end of the show. No one grows as a character, no one faces any real challenges (once they're part of MC's group), and there's just no real story arc to anything. As the show goes on, it feels more and more mechanical and predictable as the tropes seep in and originality seeps out. The production value of the show is excellent so it never really feels forced or cheaply done, but a lot of it just feels hollow. Everything is fluid and the comedy is usually pretty on point, which is why I think it's held so many viewers (including myself), but that's as deep as the show gets. There's no real conflict and all the early teases we get at ""villains"" almost never have any significance later on. Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideThe only one that's different is the Orc Lord, but once the build-up is done even that is wrapped up pretty quickly and easily. The best part of the show in my opinion is the production, and it's the only reason I kept up with it until the end of the main plot line. Otherwise I probably would've checked out some time after ep 14 or 15 when they don't even bother hiding the tropes anymore. I love the art, I love the voice acting, and I absolutely adore the design (mostly). I think I'm with the majority here who liked the OG ogres' design immensely better than the human forms. My favorite character though is probably Gabiru but I can say with confidence that it's all because of the voice acting. When I closed my eyes while he was talking I just put Kazuma in his place saying Kazuma things and laughed my butt off. (""Gabiru, Gabiru!"" ""Hai, Gabiru desu""). I had hoped, based on the first 2 or 3 eps, that this show might be able to handle an OP MC as well as, say, DBZ or One Punch Man, but unfortunately he never faces a real challenge and aside from the laughs the show becomes pretty dull because of it. Don't get me wrong, it's still well worth the watch compared to some of the absolute garbage out there, but don't get your hopes up thinking it's gonna blow your mind. As I said before, it's a great ""popcorn show"" where you can just turn off your brain and watch as adorable characters be cute and funny with each other and occasionally blow some sh*t up, but if you're looking for something quality to binge as this season draws to a close, you're better off checking out Mob Psycho 100 S2 if you haven't already.Cheers, hope this helped!",2
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"TLDR: The show decides somewhere along the line that any worthwhile factors that can drive a narrative forward and keep you invested at the same time arent needed and spends the first 10-13 episodes showing you potential and giving you hope for a great story, and the next 10-13 dragging your hopes through the mud.There will be minor spoilers that aren't marked with tags, I'll try my best to keep major ones in the boxes.I would like to start by saying that when I started watching this isekai, I loved it. It felt different, and refreshing. The way they introduced us to the world through Rimurus interactions with all the different monsters around the cave he popped out of was really cool. There was a sense of wonder: ""What kinds of monsters will he meet next? How strong is Rimuru compared to other races? How will these races interact with one another? What will happen when humans meet a talking slime? How serious will this show be? I had so many questions about how his life would change having been reborn as what is a boring monster in most fantasy RPGs. It had the appeal of the Rubber fruit from One Piece. Around the halfway mark this stopped being the case. There's no more wonder, it's just... meh....  To explain why I feel this way, let me tell you what I look for in an isekai.1. It needs to be interesting from the first two episodes.2. It needs to do world building, I want to know everything about how a world works, and why it works that way. It doesn't have to be straight away tho, some mystery is cool. 3. There has to be some fleshed out characters with some motivation in the narrative. 4. Substance, I want to feel like things that happen in the show matter. In the first 12 or so episodes all this is for the most part met. The first episodes are interesting, world building happens through Rimuru exploring the forest outside his cave, coming into contact with different monsters, and learning about the world through them as well. We get a couple characters with a personality and the plot moves forward. Then it starts backtracking, things that are happening seem to matter less and less, conflict isn't really conflict as much as it is a minor inconvenience, dire situations are only dire for races that have yet to meet our protagonist. Introductions speed up, characters stop getting fleshed out, any development you hoped for is long gone, cause there's a new story arc and it doesn't have time for the characters you started to care about. Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideIn the early episodes Rimuru and his new gang of goblins go to visit the dwarven kingdom in search of craftsmen. Some stuff happens and they get thrown out of the kingdom (with the best craftsmen they could ever get, boo-freakin-hoo), followed by the king basically exiling one of his ministers for ruining his chance to build a relationship with the powerful slime who made the only full potion they've ever seen. So that's a consequence, right? Right? Getting thrown out of dwarf land has to create some problems for them later, right? RIGHT? Nope.. About 10 episodes later they make up like nothing happened and the minister responsible for all the ""trouble"" even moves to Rimurus village to live there and do research.Once I realised every story arc is only there to introduce an ever expanding cast of characters and races, with very limited time if any for fleshing them out and making you care, and the only possible endings were, everyone is happy and everything is great, thank our mighty god Rimuru, all the issues this show has started creeping out from the shadows.There's no suspense, no character development (unless you count the atrocity that is annoying lizardman#1), no consequences and any character worth giving a damn about is either dead (or might as well be dead) or gets like 30 seconds of screentime every other episode. Granted these points mostly apply to the second half of the season, but still. It's there in the first ones as well, it just wasn't as noticeable.I got the answers to most of my questions, tho. Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideHe meets most troupe races in a gameworld fantasy setting. Goblins, Ogres, Orcs, Lizardmen, Humans, Dwarves, Druids, Fairies, and apparently some others that were cut from the anime. He is stronger than all of them combined, he only meets 3 characters that are actually stronger than he is, eats one like it didn't even matter, and befriends the other two. He befriends everyone he meets(literally, even the enemy that he ate). If a race doesn't get a long with another race, it's cause they havent met the nice slime yet. Talking monsters doesn't surprise a single human, everyone just goes with it. The show doesn't take anything seriously, and at the end I came to realise that Rimuru is barely a functioning character with a personality. Probably would've noticed sooner if they didn't introduce/reintroduce one or more characters every single f*****g episode. Even though the season isn't technically over, and there might be more I'm left dissappointed enough over a show I thought would be the best one of the season before christmas that I might not even finish it. It feels like the creator wanted this to be a long running shounen, changed his mind and made it an isekai, but kept all his characters because he still wanted to tell the same story even with less time to do it in.Oh well..P.S For the manga readers, I'm aware that the manga does a lot of this better, and producers probably screwed the last half of the season over by pushing the main plot forward. But this is still the end product, and it's dissappointing.",5
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"Let me just say right here this isn't a bad anime but, there is something more going on than pure entertainment. The protagonist is an overpowered Mary Sue, and while it was fun to watch for the first couple of episodes, I started to get this odd feeling that everything was going too well. The monsters fight and are forgiven, everyone is forgiven, everyone works together, everyone gets a name, everyone has a role, everyone contributes, everyone follows the overpowered Rimuru or is annihilated, and everyone has an undying love for their Savior or is cast out.  By the end of episode 14, I decided to not continue watching as it was incredibly on the nose with the messaging. I just literally can't. I watch anime to relax or to feel good about seeing people do the right thing, not to literally watch Jesus Christ in anime form.",5
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"An isekai that separates itself from the lackluster crap that's been put out this year! You won't regret watching this show...Thank god it's going to go for 24 episodes!The protagonist is smart and decent. And as a slime, he actually has more of a personality than the cardboard cutouts of his isekai colleagues. The world-building is exceptional! This is one of the few shows that give life and character to the NPC monsters. Contrast the cute and sexy goblins here to Goblin Slayer, for instance lol! I like that even though the protagonist has OP skills, he often has to learn it for himself. The fact that he's just a slime ball adds a unique element into the anime. He also has purpose in what he does, whether it's helping goblins rebuilding, or stopping bad guys, he actually has a reason for why he's doing it. Not just...because? I'm personally tired of isekai animes with boring OPs with OP  skills who wander aimlessly. Give them a purpose! This show has definitely delivered.",5
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"FAVOURITE FALL 2018 ANIME OR MAYBE FAVOURITE ANIME OF ALL TIME!Honestly I've probably seen all the episodes out so far whilst waiting for new content! This show possesses amazing animation, great character development, fantastic fight scenes and the perfect amount of comedy!One of my favourite animes is Overlord, well it was my favourite, until this came out! I've always loved animes where the main character begins powerful and this anime portrays it perfectly. It took me such a long time to find an anime similar where the main character actually had personality!It was so tempting not to read the manga as I did not want to spoil the rest of the season, however I couldn't help myself, this story is just too good.The only complaint I have about this anime is that I wish the episodes would come out sooner!!!",5
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"This show is definitely charming and a very fun take on the isekai genre. While it does follow many old tropes MCs usually have it does them differently. Instead of being a bland overpowered character with no ambition this show presents us with a character that takes on the role of a master of his craft which is not usually seen in many shows. Most shows have the mc under  a master. It is entertaining as he knows he is powerful and he understands his own rank and acts accordingly. Only negatives I have are the fight scenes have little to no stakes in the overall story and the show is very predictable with little characterization for most of the cast. It still bugs me that most monsters lose their monster traits and evolve into a human looking monsters. I wish they kept the monster design instead of becoming generic designs. (there are a lot, and i mean a lot, of characters by the way, i actually stopped trying to memorize most of their names) The art style is also is a bit generic with slight differences and the animation can be a bit lack luster with big explosive moves taking center stage.Nonetheless, It is a charming show, lighthearted, comedic and it isn't completely brain-dead and actually develops a very likable cast. Not the most intensive plot or characters, but it is a decent enough show among the pile of isekai trash. 3/5",5
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"If you like open world survival RPG's with an element of base building then you're gonna like That Time I got Reincarnated as a Slime. It adds nation building to the traditional Isekai formula in a way that gets gamers interested. Story 3/5: A 37 year old programmer gets stabbed and dies when he is reborn in an Isekai fantasy world as a slime with this OP ability to eat and gain powers from other monsters. He then starts to expand his influence over the area and creates a nation-state of monsters. It doesn't do anything particularly unique but it does the traditional Isekai tropes well. Where it falters is in the nation building aspect. The part about the Slime Isekai that I felt unrealistic and weak was in the adversaries and situations he had to deal with. People forgive way too easily in this anime and diplomacy and peace are practically given to him rather than earned through strategy, dialogue and negotiation. Characters 2/5: The characters are somewhat one-dimensional. There aren't really any hidden motivations or character complexity. Everyone follows their tropes really well. The main issue with this anime is that there isn't any challenge for the characters to overcome which means that character development is weak and given instead of earned. Any character who comes in contact with the main protagonist instantly becomes extremely strong without having to do anything. Moreover, everyone forgives too easily. You have entire villages mowed to the ground, hundreds of thousands of soldiers annihilated, then the next scene everyone's buddy buddy.Art/Animation 5/5: The anime is animated beautifully, The magic abilities are absolutely beautiful. The fights are dynamic and fast paced. Each swing of the sword or magic cast has a good amount of weight to it such that it feels epic whenever anyone gets a good shot off or casts a powerful spell. Also big fan of the character designs, particularly of Shion, Shuna, and Milim. ;)Sound 4/5: Good sounds, battles sound intense. The fight music fits pretty well and helps get you into the fight. Opening and Ending songs are pretty standard, not amazing. Enjoyment 4/5: This isn't a particularly deep anime but it is quite enjoyable especially if you like open world survival RPG's. It actually does fan service in a really good way. There is quite a lot of fan service but it doesn't feel gratuitous. Overall 3/5: It had a lot of potential that it could have achieved had it been more daring with its plot. It seems to take the easy way out of resolving any conflicts which inhibits its ability to really shine. It's like when you play Skyrim and you do that alchemy/enchanting trick to make OP weapons and you just one shot everything. Yeah, it's fun but it doesn't feel like you've earned anything.",4.5
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"Which is no small wonder. The ones I have bothered to watch in the past, for the most part, strike me as pathetic. But this one is different, and that's because the protagonist here isn't your typical cardboard cutout hack-n-slash maniac that you find in just about all the others. Nope, this guy, instead of becoming some kind of supernatural sword or sorcerer hero when he gets plopped in the middle of his fantasy cosmos, becomes the lowest being of the low - a slime. But instead of bemoaning the fact, he embraces it. He learns he has a penchant for engulfing other beings, and being able to assimilate their abilities. Before you know it, he's engulfed a freaking dragon. And although he's well on his way to becoming a total [email protected] @ss, he remains humble. Instead of lording over the others he meets in his new world, he finds ways to bring outcasts together. He forms an entire nation where they work hard to create a safe and secure world, where all have value to the community. This is actually fraught with peril, as it throws some serious monkey wrenches into the established order. Our hero has to find solutions to conflict, time and again. That doesn't mean he always uses force or violence to do so. He's basically a cream puff at heart. But when those he cares about are threatened, he will take the action needed. If that sounds like great writing, it is. An engaging narrative where the characters get a chance to live, make mistakes, correct them, and move on once they've grown a little bit. The artwork is a little pedestrian, there is no ground breaking in that regard, but everything is rendered in a quality, professional way. I liked the background work. The animation is better than most in this genre. A few iffy sequences in the middle episodes, where it was obvious they were trying to pinch pennies, but nothing that was too grievous. The Japanese voice acting was well done and heartfelt. I got the feeling the cast sensed it was doing something exceptional, and they really put their hearts into it. I never thought I'd ever say this about any isekai, but I would really like to see the producers come out with more seasons of this title. There is so much more I can see them doing with Rimuru, and his world, that would be engaging. I will be more than a little disappointed if they don't give us some more slime. Hopefully very soon!",4.5
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"This show is the incarnation of wholesome. Something about it just makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside. The studio seems to put a lot of love and care into it. The animation is beautiful, and the sound effects are unique and distinctly pleasant. The plot is interesting and refreshing. My only negatives would be a little bit too much fan service with Shion’s breasts and the pacing seems too rushed. It feels like important content is being skipped from time to time. I am excited to see where this series goes for season 2.",5
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"That Time I Got Reincarnated As A Slime (which I'm going to abbreviate to just Slime) is an anime full of great ideas that kept me watching. Unfortunately, ideas is all it has; if you're expecting a new, fresh take on the Isekai genre, this isn't it.At least in the beginning, Slime does distinguish itself from other Isekai anime. Instead of the protagonist waking up in their new fantasy world as a plucky, level 1 adventurer, protagonist Rimuru Tempest wakes up as a lowly blue slime. After meeting up with the Storm Dragon Veldora, who's imprisoned in the cave Rimuru awakens in, our slimy protagonist makes a pact with Veldora to free him. After consuming the dragon like he's Kirby, prison and all, Rimuru ends up stumbling into leading a village of goblins, first protecting them from a pack of direwolves. It's at this early point in the show where one of the many great, intriguing ideas of Slime shows its face. To make things easier on himself, Rimuru gives all the goblins names. Unbeknownst to him, however, giving a name to a nameless monster in this world causes them to evolve, and the entire village of stumpy, weak goblins grows into much stronger hobgoblins overnight. The concept of ""names=power"" is one of the most fascinating ideas in Slime, but unfortunately, the show never even tries to go into more depth with it. If naming a monster gives them more power, are nameless monsters treated like second-class citizens? When monsters receive names, they usually become more human-like, so does that mean humans are some sort of ideal being in this world? Does a newborn baby not qualify as a human until it gets a name? If I name my dog, is it going to turn into a bishounen furry and start talking to me?None of these questions, or even anything like them, are dealt with in Slime. The show treats its naming mechanic as just a way to turn monstrous characters into more palatable, attractive humanoids (If you think the goblins' evolutions were bad, wait until you meet the ogres).I could overlook the missed potential... if the anime itself was anything interesting at all. Throughout all 24 episodes, practically no obstacle that ever presents itself to Rimuru poses any sort of challenge to him. The many enemies that he faces never pose an actual threat, so there's never any tension to the show. Adding to that, the presentation is nothing to write home about either; the animation is serviceable but not especially eye-catching, the music is forgettable, and the less said about the character designs the better.All in all, there's not much of a reason to reccomend Slime. While it shows promise early on, it eventually proves itself to be just another cookie-cutter Isekai anime. If you want to be frustrated at the countless times it ignores potentially unique and groundbreaking plotlines, that's pretty much all there is to see here.",3

that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"SLIME: 10.0/10.0 DC points (Dylan's crunch points)What a brilliant anime! The story line is very easy to follow, but it's not always predictable... which keeps it exciting. The super powers and character development are spectacular. Consistent fight scenes, mixed with on-going story development & new characters keeps each episode action packed and fun to watch. Highly recommend for people just getting into anime and anime lovers alike. Enjoy",4
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"The first 12 episodes do a lot of subtle things that make this series so enjoyable to watch.  The animation is silky smooth.  It has cute girls (and boys if that's your jam), but doesn't focus on that.  The pacing is perfection!  It just feels so relaxed, even though there's a lot going on, something important is always happening.  It doesn't rely on monologing or flashbacks of previously iterated content, it just expects that you are able keep up (weird, right?).  I love the world building.  Also the OP and ED.  It's a fun show about being nice to monsters.The next part abandons all that, and mostly mines for content and hot springs scenes.  Plus two recap episodes.  Ugh.If this series moves on, I'm not sure what to expect.",5
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"I honestly don't see what people see in this show. The world is generic for an Isekai show, and it's something you would see in shows like Konosuba, Re:Zero etc.My biggest annoyance with this show is the MC. He is just SO unappealing and boring. Everything gets handed to him easily. Need to defeat a huge golem? ONE PUNCH! Need to defeat an orc lord? ONE PUNCH! Ohhh a demon loli went to your nation, wants to fight you but she is overpowered and stronger than you? GIVE HER SOME HONEY AND BECOME HER BEST FRIEND, WHY WOULD YOU LOSE?? Whenever they introduce a ""powerful"" villain he just gets his ass kicked, because there is NO tension when you know that the MC will win no matter what.Characters (especially female ones) are uselessly introduced just to be forgotten the next episode, or if they're not thrown into the dark depths of boring story following/progression, are made to be boob flesh for blob boy to use when he's bored.It's infuriating how boring it is to follow this character's story. Mob Psycho 100 handles OP characters beautifully, something this show will never achieve. As i have said, everything gets handed to him on silver platter. Everyone worships him as he's the ""great tempest "" aka Jesus Christ in anime form. No plot ✓ No tension ✓ No real threat ✓ Useless characters ✓ Unappealing MC ✓ Yup, everything checks out .Overall a really bad show that people for some reason love, i honestly don't know why i watched all 24 episodes.I'm giving it two stars just because of the somewhat decent animation, otherwise it's a straight up one star.MANGA SPOILER!!  Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideIt's even worse when you find out that in the Manga he literally becomes a god at the end. WHAT THE F#$K?!""",3
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"It's a wonderful thing this day and age to come across an anime that is simply good.  Protagonist, from the very first episode is someone you immediately get a connection with, even down to a tried but true last request to his Kohai.The anime is full of wonder turns of phrases based around who the protag...   ok his Name Is Rimmuru, yeah that is a capital name, names are in some cases capital in this series, which is a rare path to explore that few anime try to incorporate... I am intentionally being vague as honestly a lot of this stuff is part and parcel to the anime really drawing you in.. It's quirks to the world being, side from slimes and faeries and demons, oh my, that make it so enjoyable to watch.Rimuru is a fantastic main character, identifiable, free from most tropes such as harems, even though the series does include many attractive harem candidates, they are simply not dumbed down to being 'harem girl: tsundere"".Characters have ranges of emotions, from arrogant to semic comic relief, and it flows without issue, much like it would in real life.  Nothing takes itself too seriously about the series, Rimmuru even takes pot shots at himself, and despite serious portions of the storyline existing, it never leaves the realm of ""this may be serious, but life is like that sometimes"".  As cliche as it is, you will laugh till you can't breathe and have to pause the show, or you will cry and almost feel gutted, the premise however remains the same, working through life, overcoming it, and occasionally eating dragons.My review is convoluted, and odd, but I honestly love this show, I have watched the entire series twice, and still bounce back to earlier episodes if I think I missed something.  I can't ask for more from a show than to have an engrossing storyline, enjoyable or detestable characters, a sense of humor about it-self, enjoyable art, fantastic world setting and an ever more involved storyline.  Watch this show if you have a reasonably good sense of humor, like fantasy settings and enjoy a show for what it is.  Don't watch it if you are ever so srs, have a political or whatever agenda, or can't tell filler from origin stories.",3
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,As i continue to watch watch this anime as much as i enjoy it i am slightly disappointed by how much content they cut from the manga so much so that some key parts are completely different. Some scenes are completely skipped and replace with a brief summary. so you end up losing any funny thing that happened or even stuff that could have been put into another whole episode. I am not trying to be some Manga know it all but after watching a lot of Anime that runs almost exactly like the manga it gets hard for me to enjoy the anime content when i know there is a lot more story or getting disappointed when you are waiting to see a scene from the manga play out in action only for it to be skipped or for something that was kept short and sweet in the manga to be stretched out and become boring. All in all this is a good anime the Characters are cool and the action sequences are engaging but after seeing so many differences i'm no longer eager to see what happens in the next episode.,5
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"They've done great with the anime, capturing the feel and vib of the world Rimuru is in, but I have some problems with the translation from Source material to the Anime. Originally this was a Lite Novel, then a Manga, to an Anime, i've read the first volume of the LT and most of the manga I could find, and I have noticed huge skips in the story telling, Such as the making of the Story to cover up who actually defeated the Orc Lord, the travel to the Kingdom to see the kids, Charybdis arc was a complete mess and Missing minor details. This isnt FMA to FMA:B but the minor details made the world much more lived in and believable, and you can notice most of the Skipped details and story in the form of From this scene To that scene , like from defeating Charybdis to extracting it from the dude, there was a whole dialog and discussion about it, and traveling to the human kingdom wouldve taken Rimurur thru andother kingdom to the adventurers guild of that kingdom and then to the academy to the children, not just a straight shoot to the kids, there was emphasis on the Full Heal potion that is completely missing from the entire story . I love the anime, the art style is wonderful, and they are hitting the main points of it, but the minor points and i wouldnt say side stories but sub stories that added to the world and gave context to events are missing and make things feel ""Off"" in the flow of the story. If you like the Isekai genre, you'll love this show, at the least, you'll enjoy it,If you know the source material, you'll feel a bit disappointed with how they ""fast lane"" the main story, whether it be for episode constraints or whatever it's how it is3.7/5 Stars",3
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,This anime is so good. The animation is true to the manga sometimes even better than the original source material. The soundtrack of this anime is one of the best ones that I have heard in a while. The fight scenes are very epic with great visuals. Every character in this anime is distinctive and the story is this anime is complex yet straightforward with no repetition. Every week I wait in anticipation for the next episode as I await what happens next in this amazing story. I highly recommend this anime to everybody! Ps milim is best girl.,5
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"I think this show has a similar feel to it as Overlord. The main character is thrown into a new world and given immense power. You get to watch as they discover just how powerful they are. I liked Overlord's first season but then it kind of fell off for me. I wonder how this one will do. I am 6 episodes in right now. I was worried it was just another harem anime and maybe it is later on based on the art and the main character's goals sexually. But so far I'm enjoying myself so I guess that's all you need. Animation is nice, characters are entertaining. Got some back story on the love interest. I wonder where it's all leading and if it will end as a cliffhanger like Konosuba, leave it to our imaginations on the party continuing their adventures.",4.5
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"This anime caught my eye while I was looking for a new show to devote my soul to. THIS WAS IT! My new favorite! I wish there were more episodes, but regardless, this is one I'll never forget! The characters are so lovable and the plot flows pretty smoothly. I couldn't put my IPad down and spent the entire day watching! It's really addicting and leaves the viewer with a hunger for the next episode. Honestly, the only complaint I have is that the art style isn't my favorite. Other than that, this is ultimately my all time favorite anime after watching Kill La Kill, Fairy Tail, Assassination classroom, Ancient Magus Bride, Sailor Moon, The Devil is a Part-timer, One Punch Man, Mob Phsyco100, Sword Art Online, and a ton more! All of those animes were fantastic, but this one really took a firm hold on my heart! This is one ill never let go!",4.5
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"As of now, this is easily my favorite show of this season. Its sad that its only gonna be 25 episodes. Having not read the manga and not really being a manga reader since im in high school and have priorities, I enjoy sitting down to eat or laying in bed watching anime that i actually like. When i first started watching this show, it was about 11 o clock on a school night in which i wake up at 7 in the morning... being who i am, i got carried away and stayed awake until almost 3 watching the first 12 episodes. I was so obsessed with this anime that i watched the next episode while waiting for the shower to warm up and after i got to school with the few minutes of time i had before my first class. I havent watched a lot of Isekai anime. I come from growing up with dragon ball and a little bit of Full metal alchemist, and only recently got into other animes. Despite this, this anime makes me really happy that ive been able to branch off and enjoy new anime. I get attached to characters i like really easily, and this anime is FULL of lovable characters. Being 16 episodes in, i really wish i would have started watching it back in july when it was fresh. Having to catch up makes me feel like i missed out on some of the suspense, or lack their of, with this anime. Overall, im very glad that ive been watching Slime and when its all said and done will probably rewatch it multiples time when im waiting weeks in between other shows. PLEASE watch this, you will LOVE it!!!",5
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"I originally picked this anime up because the thought of a slime as the main character just seemed refreshing and comedic to the now over-saturated market of ""other dimension adventure anime,"" and it turned out to be one of my favorites! I love the pacing of the story and the wholesomeness of it; it's nice to watch an anime where I don't have to be on the edge all the time, and there's no cliche super-evil-villain-waiting-to-destroy-the-world type story. But even with the overall lighter tone compared to other anime, this show still manages to include action and some tear-jerker moments so it stays interesting.I highly recommend this show for anyone and everyone!",5
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"As I have seen the popular isekai anime, I can say this is only the second one that has stood out to me. The one other was Overlord. The reason being was the reversal of the usual. The protagonist is OP and there's always a struggle in every fight, but it's predictable that the protagonist is capable of defeating the antagonist. But Overlord is in the eyes of an obvious antagonist. Which made it memorable and putting it in its own category. TIGRAS is also in its own category. It's actually good! No plot holes, great character development, and entertaining. The thoughts that go through Rimuru's mind are (somewhat) logical for someone that was reincarnated. Yes he's OP, but he doesn't question his own strength. Making his and the development of side characters outstanding! I very much recommend. Easy 5 stars from me.",5
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"This anime I think is very special, good character design, a main character who doesn't always jump the gun whenever someone so much as udders wolf, and a serious and also playful  and loving sort of atmosphere. It reminds me heavily of sitting down playing 'Dragon Quest IX Sentinels of The Starry Sky' with friends. The stories of that game was gripping and all ties in with the main over arching story. I feel this series has that and many other similar, but very good and complimentary themes. If you are looking to laugh, cry a bit at times, and smile for a while; after it all, this series is right up your alley!",3
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"I started to watch this out of boredom and with no expectations but after that I became pleasantly surprised how good the anime was. I fell in love with characters immediately and the story was just as good. I ended reading the manga and the web novel I will probably buy the light novel as well. This series has Made its place on my 'the best series of all time"" list and I am so glad I chose to watch it even when I thought it would be something I would not like. Everyone who is wondering if they should watch ""that time I got reincarnated as a slime"" , I say ""please do"". It's definitely worth it!",3
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"Excuse my lack of how simulcasts work & I may be a newb to the releasing of episodes, but what happened to episode 14 for 12/31/18. I guess there is a break between the normal/final episodes??? Will there be an episode 14, since I have seen other anime's just stop after only 1 or 3 that aren't movies or one off's.Can someone post when the next one will be released since I cant seem to find it on any of the default Crunchyroll posted schedules?.I noticed something different about this one, the characters surrounding the main seem to have greater depth and character development instead of all the power/glory going to the main.  Extremely refreshing.Overall a great series & fun to watch over and over, especially with friends who have never seen it. Just the reactions alone of bewilderment and laughter are worth every minute spent.  I do enjoy this one just as much as I did GATE, looking forward to every new episode, having actual discussions about what was good or bad and knowing each new episode is possibly just as good as the last.",4
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"This show truly left me on the edge of my seat. Each episode is as compelling as the last and I for one cannot wait for more content to be released! This anime is humorous and detailed with many moments that made me feel as if I was within an outstanding novel, with each episode being the next chapter. Whilst one would usually loathe the completion of a good book, I can't wait until I can lay witness to the climax of this anime's story... It's not as if this anime is perfect but its imperfections can be overlooked for the sake of a wholesome experience.",5
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"It's an isekai with some nuances. One being  Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hidehe gets reincarnated as a slime Okay big spoiler, but seriously I wasn't sure what to expect. You'd think a slime is some weak monster but with his skills he becomes much more.His skills are kind of OP but he's not necessarily the strongest monster right away. The MC is the right balance for an MC. He's not a push over and he's not an insufferable NEET that rejects his harem. In fact, it's cool seeing the slime conquer and grow. I can't really put my finger on why this is so good but it's pretty captivating even after the first few episodes.The side characters are pretty funny as well and they too grow along in the anime.",5
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"I think we all have to agree that the ""into a new world"" isekai concept is overdone. I went into this anime thinking it'll be like every other anime of this genre. Boyyyy was I wronggg. The one major difference, the main character is damn cute slime. A SLIME! Not only that but this SLIME is OP. The story is fluid, the characters are fun, the animation is *muah muah*. I think you know what to do. Watch, duhhh.",4
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"I absolutely love this show in every way possible.The animation style is cheery and bright, the music is fitting, the balance of comedy and tragedy is amazing and honestly unexpected, the story and character development is believable (with some obvious reservations), and the overall mood of this show is inviting and feel-good anime.I'm not going into any details on the story because you should be watching it right now anyways.Stop Reading Reviews And Go Watch The Whole Thing.five outta five",2
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"The show is such a masterpiece, with its outstanding comedy, action, and weirdness, it creates this void of never-ending entertainment that many people would enjoy. Surely the plot is a bit off, but once you start getting into the show, everything starts making sense. Not only do I recommend this anime for its comedy, but also it's emotional and action side pays a great tribute to this as well. May this show run for a long time.",4.5
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"I saw this anime pop up several times and I didn't even click to see what it was about because I assumed it was one of those that were a waste of time even watching the intro or reading the reviews.  After the number of anime in my queues went down after the season ended for a bunch, I was browsing through at random and accidentally clicked on this one, and saw that it had really high reviews.  So instead of reading the description or anything I just dove into it since I had time to kill.  5 minutes into it, I was stuck.  Went through all the episodes out right now and can't wait for the next one.  Although the title is pretty stupid sounding, it actually makes sense after watching ep1.  The story is pretty good and it has a good combo of bad ass, hilarious, and the feels... This is one that I can probably go back and watch again over and over.  It's a plus if you understand Japanese.",4.5
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,"BOY was I wrong. Good lord, don't take this show for face value. It's a witty comedy that takes the classic isekai we've all grown to love/hate and rewrites the formula in the most refreshing, yet hilariously outrageous way. The show is incredibly well-paced, and while maintaining a lighthearted air, the director also knows when to tone down the jokes in its more serious moments. To my surprise, he even manages to use the nature of the isekai genre to his advantage in making one of the most tear-jerkingly beautiful scenes I've seen in recent anime, especially this early on into a series. It skyrocketed my hopes up for the rest of its run, and I doubt it'll disappoint!",5
that-time-i-got-reincarnated-as-a-slime,I have to say I would probably not have even looked at this anime had a friend not recommended it to me. I thought it would be just another tale of an incredibly OP main character just laying waste to everything he touches. What happened after watching the first episode however was that I was immediately hooked.  I binge read the manga as soon as I finished watching the first few episodes of the series and am happily surprised with how close the anime adaptation is to the original series. I even picked up the light novel and am currently making my way through that. The anime however hooks you and you will be in pain every week waiting for the next episode. The animation quality is superb and the characters and plot are both gripping. Overall I'd say this is my favorite anime this season and one of my favorites ever. I'm really looking forward to seeing what future seasons have in store!,5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"I don't write these. this is my first, this show is a gift from the anime gods. it is perfection. not an opinion. a fact.8 episodes in and they are all flawless.  except the fact i want more of them. The Plot effortlessly moves between powerful, creepy, hilarious, and emotional. You love the characters. You are invested. Animation is honestly so gorgeous it ruins other animes for me a bit. Stop looking at reviews and hit play, you're welcome",5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"START WATCHING THIS NOW, EPISODE 19 IS A DAMN HOLIDAY.IT WILL GO DOWN IN HISTORY... I SAID ""OH Sh*@!"" like 3 timesJust the entire package of how they weave the music into the fight scenes, their color schemes, and the character designs just make this an untouchable series. This is one of the most SOLID shows I've stuck by to watch. And is definitely in my top 3 favorites, and it hasn't even ended the season. I have no words for this one.. LETS KEEP IT ALIVE",5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"Edit after ep.8: This is the new measuring stick. The show rose the bar on animation quality, music, story, and direction. This is how you make anime! It puts the 5 star anime from the last few years to shame! See bellow for details. Edit after ep.4:The anime get's even better. If they leave us with only the 4 episodes, this is still better than most anime ever. I'm not one to exaggerate, or heap praise, the classic water homage, the vocals, music, setting, everything is on point. Not to forget first boss battle done right in a long time. No useless power up sequences, everything was fast pace like a sword fight ought to be! Very satisfying, maybe close to original Berserk demon fights, but better animation and even less wasted efforts.Initial impressions: If you're tired of Marry and Mark Sue characters who ""awaken"" and just have a super power, and are unstoppable, watch this show. Oh boy, our protagonist's road to power is highly realistic even if most of it is folklore and mysticism. At the end of the training, he would be a force akin to a demon to the layman's eye. In one of the episodes he trains so much, he wears off the skin of his palms off. Been there, done that before a race. It happens, and it doesn't really hurt more than average durring training, but the morning after, oof, that burns! Our poor orphaned hero has just one reason to train this hard, his pure brotherly love for his sister.The chestnut haired hero returns home to find all his brothers and sisters killed, his mother eaten half through, the shocking image sends him reeling, and he trips over his half dead sister. Throws her on his back and runs towards the town. On the way it's found out that she is a demon, so he is sent to a demon slayer trainer, as he vows to turn her back. Simple story, told in a magnificent way. The animation is well detailed, so far the cover art shown is the same, maybe even lesser quality than the actual anime. The story is not pedantic, but it isn't simplified either. Things that must be said aren't glossed over, but aren't repeated ad nauseum either. The pace is nice, and the humor is a welcome surprise. If you are just starting, I recommend watching episode 1, 2, and 3 together since there is a bit to unpack. But, if you can't, watch 1 and 2 at the very least, since episode one is way more sorrowful, than the anime mood in general is intended to be. Watching episode one alone is a lot like eating the mustard without the hotdog, yes some love it, but it's too much for most people.",5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"While there are a few cliches in the opening episode, some of that is natural when it's such a popular genre. It's well written.The animation feels well blended with some CG elements, and overall feels smooth. The artwork, while not overly complex, is also solid and has a good feel. The details are in the right places. While the premise isn't really new, they still manage to make it quite interesting. My only complaint is the way they occasionally talk down to the audience with excessive monologues. Yes, I saw what happened, I don't need the characters to explain what I just saw by talking out loud. Still, this anime is very good so far, and I look forward to each episode. Just when you think you have the world figured out, it branches out just a bit more...",5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"Kimetsu no Yaiba came out 3 years ago in weekly shonen jump along with The Promised Neverland, and Dr.Stone. But unlike those series, Kimetsu is underated (in the west).It's definitely going to gain more recognition with the anime and be counted amongst the greats (DB, YYH, OP, HxH, Naruto, etc) as people get further into the series.Just 1 chapter in & it became one of my favs. Now it has a superb anime adapation. ^__^",5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"As much as I love the anime as a whole, I mostly came here to rave about its unique and incredibly visually-stunning art style. Many anime of the current age is full of shoddy 3D animation that has taken over the market. So this is a refreshing piece which I welcome with open arms. With its unique character designs, fluid action sequences, and gorgeous landscapes, weaving a tapestry of eye-gasmic beauty!While Demon Slayer is full of well executed plot points, so far at 7 episodes there has been a disappointing level of character development. Thus far, Tanjirou's (the protagonist) only known traits is his determination, his protective nature of his younger sister, and his good natured spirit. These character qualities can be seen in any number of action-oriented shows, and given the unfortunate circumstance of Nezuko Kamado (Tanjirou’s sister), her character will probably be relegated to an ‘unforeseen’ plot twist to stymie Tanjirou in his quest. A quest that feels somewhat predictable given Tanjirou’s motivations; however, an exciting one, nonetheless.All in all, this is a beautiful anime with an intense amount of action. And I don't mean intense as in nonstop, but given the rather dark side of the underlying plot, it is rather in a fashion where you can feel a tension accumulate and surge up as Tanjirou moves from one challenge to the next. But I love that this series gives an appropriate amount of time spent on each of those challenges; it neither needlessly draws any sequence out with unnecessary ""white noise"", nor does it cut anything short, but rather has a good flow of the story line as a whole. I recommend everyone give this one a try! And did I say it is gorgeously animated yet?",5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"One of the best Shonen adaptions of our time and by far the best show to air in 2019.The heart and soul of amazingly talented staffs at Studio Ufotable translated into this emotionally charged and visually stunning series, creating a roller coaster ride filled with breathtaking moments. The Ukiyo-e style splash action sequence and seamless 3D incorporation further enhance the intensity of critical decisions in this Dark Fantasy, taking viewer immersion to a whole new level. Excellent overall execution and cinema level quality production down to every last detail. This is a Must Watch.Rating: 5/5 - A masterpiece. I would recommend this to everyone who loves anime.",5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"Starting from a couple years back I would have never thought this story to be adapted into a full animated series, but learning of it's adaptation by Ufotable was a dream come true. For those who are just curious, I have found (after rereading from the beginning for a third time while new chapters/episodes come out...) that the anime so far - in the time I am typing this up - has more than perfectly followed the manga with certain scenes matching up perfectly with panels from the manga . Actually, instead of removing or changing parts, they've ADDED minor bits and details showing how much effort is going into this story. Therefore I encourage those who are starting from the animated series to wait patiently for new episodes rather than moving to the manga because I personally believe it will be a much more gratifying experience! I greatly appreciate Ufotable for taking this story into their hands and am genuinely excited to see the interpretations of character's voices and fight scenes by their staff. So far, the voice acting choices in my personal opinion have been close to spot-on. Let's go Kaneki!",5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"TL;DR: He protec, he attac, but most importantly he use his air sac. 3 Episode Test: PassedBrought to life by studio Ufotable of the Fate series together with Director Haruo Sotozaki & Producer Hikaru Kondo of the Tales of Zestiria, this anime has the potential to become a new age classic. Breathing new life into the Spring & Summer 2019 line up, this anime has proved to be a cut above any competition.The animation:The art style of mangaka Koyoharu Gotōge has been lifted from the page and given a life of its own. As an Action/Shounen style story, Demon Slayer delivers on its fight choreography and stunning fight scenes. Something remarkable to note about these scenes in particular is Ufotable's delicate use of CGI animation to enhance its 2D fight sequences.  Instead of detracting from the 2D art style, the animators chose to bring the character's attacks to life with CGI animation. No where is this more prevalent than the main protagonist's slashes and stances using a style referred to as Water Breathing; depicting traditional Japanese art sytled water forming along the protagonists sword and flowing along his slashes in a way that 2D animation alone could not express. Other uses of CGI like backgrounds or environments are so subtle or well done that they blend seamlessly.  It is the marriage of these two animations and the soft skillful hand of the CGI team that really make the action scenes in this series pop.The characters:Portrayed with easily identifiable colors and outfits, the primary, secondary and even a few background characters manage to feel distinct in this world; each with their own personalities, motivations and story to tell. Even a few episodes in the viewer will easily be able to identify which characters are which; an important feat for a series with an ever increasing roster.Buckle up however as the horror elements of this story come at you fast; as the story sends the unprepared viewer on an all expenses paid feels trip within the first few episodes. While not the primary attribute of this series, at no point in time does the viewer feel like the characters are free from harm; as physical, emotional and psychological trauma is routinely inflicted upon the main cast of characters. Battles feel like they have a real weight to them; as the characters are forced to spend time in the story healing as a result of their injuries or carry their injuries from previous battles into future encounters.The main protagonist Tanjirou Kamado was taken from the Shounen industry mold of young high spirited boys with bright colored haired and a knack for shouting; but given a major upgrade to his character.  Kind and compassionate even against his opponents despite both his and their dark past, Tanjirou is a compelling and talented but flawed underdog that the viewer can't help but cheer for or visualize themselves as. While the animation may picture him and other hunters as powerful elemental wielding heroes, in the end all these young hunters have are their blades, training and wit against the superior might, regenerative and even supernatural abilities of demons.  Take away the flashy stylistic metaphors of their attacks and these are young adults with swords facing down nigh-immortal creatures in a world where death is all but certain.Worldbuilding: The story of Demon Slayer feels very well thought out and lived in; where if the viewer would to be transported to that world, they could easily imagine themselves interacting with the characters or going off on their own mission to save villages and slay evil demons.At the center of this world is the Demon Hunter Corps (DHC), a membership of highly trained fighters who work to protect humanity from the scourge of demons.  We learn early on about its membership's ranks, how initiates are groomed for membership and tested, how society views members of the DHC, and why only the members of the DHC are able to tackle the demons. A very nice touch that I loved in the story came with the introduction of how demons in this world hate the smell of the flower Wisteria. Later on, the audience learns of an influential family who house and heal wounded members of the DHC due to their lives being saved by the Corps, their mutual partnership that grew from that with the DHC and that family's adoption of the Wisteria flower as their family crest. Small things like that really help to flesh out the world of Demon Slayer. The story and fights are engaging, the enemies and characters abilities are exciting to see clash on screen, the character's and their development is solid, the music and animation are fantastic and the mysteries/history slowly sown throughout the series leave the viewer anticipating how the story will unfold. 5/5 Stars: If you're a fan of action anime you'll love this series; and with portions of horror, supernatural, drama and the tried & true coming of age tale mixed in, there's certainly something for different viewers to enjoy as well. The series is definitely worth your time checking out.",5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"This is one of the few animes I will EVER give a 5/5. It truly deserves it.Animation, as a big time amateur artist and animator, I've become more critical of what I watch and it's animation as I hone myself to become at least mediocre. This show stylizes it's animation in such a way it makes it so, so, smooth. The flash of colors in an otherwise very dull colored show except for key features like character's hair and eyes. Especially their eyes I'm adoring the rough edged eyes. Making them look sharper and more reason to look directly into their eyes as they speak.Music is great, it fills the shounen genre really well. I cannot complain about it and episode 19? Oof, that ending was a treat from both music, and animation.Story, FINALLY, another show where they're not trying to make an immediate ""Love interest"" character like Shield Hero did with Ralphtalia. It's a simple plot, but that's it's beauty, it doesn't need fancy over the top plot. It knows what it is, and is keeping it's narrative strong with few drops in quality. Also one of the few animes I can applaud for, wow you actually shown the character's life and how others see him BEFORE the driving plot point makes him setout to do what he does. The show even has the guts to try and make us sympathize with the demons after some of them have been killed. I'm sorry, this show deserves nothing but praise. If a cynical person like me can be enthralled by a shounen, a shounen usually one of the laziest genres next to isekai. It deserves every penny it gets. Those nearly 330 5/5  (reviews at current time.) are proof enough if you even hate anime, you should watch this show. Just the fact that it tries to be anime but hasn't tried any of the easy dialogue, cheap and poorly done CGI, or just generic ""epic"" music to get people pumped up.",5

demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"As the industry standards continue their freefall past mediocrity and into glorified amateurism, Demon Slayer has instead chosen to overcome all odds to become the best seasonal Japan has managed to produce in the last several years.  This is the standard to which all shounen should be held: superb animation, inspired choreography, and character designs that are the closest to being unique I've seen in years - but without being excessive or overdone.  The story could be described as simple, but its straightforward nature is complemented by its fast and reliable pacing, consistently written characters, and tactful negotiation of its surprising emotional berth.",5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"This show so far has shown only promise. It incorporates Japanese culture quite well and in only one episode, captivates the audience with its quality of animation and fast paced story.So far I love the first two episodes and can't wait to see where it leads. As the world hasn't been properly introduced yet, i'm sure there is much in store for the main two protagonists and am keen to see how their stories are told.",5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"This anime is a straight up masterpiece. The animation, sound design, character development are all fantastic. While the core plot is a bit generic, the way that it tells the story, the characters that we follow, and the animation make this anime incredibly entertaining. Story 3/5: My biggest and only real complaint about this anime is the simplicity of the plot. By virtue of the genre itself, it's harder to come up with an interesting original concept. Basically, its about a guy who trains to kill demons so that he can avenge his family and also to turn his sister back into a human. Not too much else to say about it.Characters 5/5: Demon slayer is an anime that really rises to greatness due to the strength of the characters, specifically the amazing pure-heartedness of the main character, Tanjiro. Each character has this slight air of despair and suffering, but it doesn't stop them from doing their duties. No one really WANTS to be a demon slayer, except for maybe Inosuke. They all do it out of duty, honor, loyalty, revenge, or justice. The prevalence of evil in the world is what causes the main character to go on his journey in the first place yet it does not corrupt his pure-hearted desire to make sure no one has to suffer as he has. Part of what makes the main character so great is that he genuinely cares for others, even the enemy. He does not see his enemies as purely evil, but rather forced into it through external forces. He sympathizes with each enemy's tragic past.Art/Animation 6/5: My god this anime is absolutely beautiful. Each frame is practically its own artwork. ufotable's animation team really went all out on this and its absolutely god damn fantastic. Fight scenes come to life and the dynamic camera adds so much to your enjoyment of the fight scenes. 2 fight scenes really stand out to me as being absolutely amazing: The room shifting demon, and the spider demon. Both scenes have amazing use of dynamic camera following Tanjiro as he goes off and kicks some ass.Sound 5/5: The songs and sound design have an air of like being a samurai and living in feudal japan, and then when the action kicks up it just gains this absolutely majestic epic feeling as the sound of water and fire and swords cuts through the air and its just like FUCK YEAH SLASH THAT BITCH. God damn episode 19 was amazing.Enjoyment 5/5: The animation, the characters, the sound design all come together to make this nearly perfect anime with this amazing balance of action, drama, comedy. Also, there's this incredible amount of weight that each swing of the sword has. Thanks to the combination of the sound design and animation, every fight just feels absolutely epic. With most shounen anime, there's this emphasis on that final blow, the climax of the battle, and Demon Slayer does not disappoint when it comes to those moments.Overall 5/5: Absolute masterpiece. What more can I say?",5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"The story of Demon Slayer, at least through episode 24, has been enjoyable indeed, but the real treat this anime brings is it's visual presentations. Great designs from the get go, immersive scenery, and impressive shading can all be seen in the first few episodes. But Ufotable kept going. The combat scenes are choreographed so well. It seems like nothing is wasted in their designs. Then the best part: the artistic impressions. Water flowing from blade strokes like the blade does through it's foes, lightning striking it's own foes as quickly as the blade is drawn and sheathed. These effects are not actually present in the anime's world, but, in my opinion, immerse us viewers in ways normal fight scenes could never do.I am hoping Ufotable gets to ride this anime all the way, and CANNOT wait to see their expert designs for many, many more beautiful episodes.",5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"All I have to say is GAME CHANGING!! I am a heavy anime watcher and consider Naruto, one piece, Bleach etc.. Good ""starter"" anime for someone just getting into anime, but that's it they are just ""entry level"". And consider some of the greats to be maybe Claymore, Elfen Lied, FMA, Darker than black Etc.. But they can be a bit to dark/mature for most.. That's where DEMON SLAYER comes in if there's any current anime that's out there that almost perfectly mixes the two together its Demon slayer. HxH and My hero academia did very well in doing this as well too, but both just barely miss one or two things. Demon Slayer has insanely high potential right now and consider it the closest currently to the perfect mix that any Heavy anime watcher and Beginner watcher can enjoy. Nice mature storyline, gore but not exaggerated has good humor but not over the top and so much more. I've got high hopes for this anime, just hope they don't make the mistake of rushing out eps for the f of it .",5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"You guys. You don't even know what's coming. This manga is incredible and what's best of all is the anime has been following it pretty religiously. The animation really brings it to life. It's detailed, with the sword techniques in vibrant color. I can't say enough. I think the characters are so different from each other and they all have different backstories. It's cool to see them grow, depend on each other, and of course see their techniques evolve. This is top 10 best anime for me. I can't wait for it to be finished so I can binge it all at once. I will say that some episodes are more interesting than others in terms of visuals but that's not because of the actual animation quality but rather they needed less battle and more story. You won't be disappointed. Finally. The music is awesome too. Really fits the theme and doesn't overpower anything for me at any time. If you want to know a little about the story - There's Tanjiro who is the main character. He's uber kindhearted and friendly. His heart is probably his biggest asset and he really helps those around him grow. His sister Nezuko was turned into a demon and without giving away too much, they are fighting to return her to a human. They do this  by Tanjiro becoming a demon slayer.",5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,Was about to skip but decided to click on it anyway. Animation looks great and hope that it continues on this well. Hopefully though this is not one of the shows where he falls in love with hi sister because that will piss me off considering how much potential this show has. Would be great if he ended up marrying a princess or something and became king or found out about some hidden relative etc.Well thats all I have to say LMK if this was helpful.,5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"Love this series. Re-watched it at least 5 times through live reactions. Can't wait for upcoming seasons.This anime is very good for many reasons. Ufotable never slacks during the series which is very obvious the more you watch. The animation is amazing and consistent, all uses of cgi are good (the only show i have ever seen pulling off good cgi). The soundtrack is very good too. Each episode is interesting and I remember wanting the next episode so badly when I watched this from week to week as it was coming out.",5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"As far as adaptations go Demon Slayer is one of the better ones. It took the source material and explored it. Nearly seamlessly blending its 3d and 2d elements to enhance the battles into a dynamic roller coaster and drawing out the key moments of characters into near romantic qualities. The problem is it also stretches out elements it had no business to extend thereby jittering the pacing of the series. The story is either wonderfully paced where everything builds on itself and everything is given an appropriate amount of time to be explored, or thirty minutes of ""feel bad for x because y"". But when everything is ironed out nicely and the animations at its peak you end up with a masterclass of music and animation... at its worse you end up with a game of pong that you just want to be over :/",5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"By far my favorite manga i've read in 5 years of reading, and slowly becoming my favorite anime in 9 years of watching. The manga is definitely better than the anime, with the increase of story telling and depth (the usual) , But the anime isn't too far behind. The anime has amazing fight scenes, and puts a new ""perspective"" on anime with the use of cool camera angles, cool battle and ability animation, and really funny dialogue. Just the concept of demon slayers risking there lives and battling in a world over run by demons is intriguing to me and i'm sure others. 10/10 would recommend.",5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"I am in love with this show. The fight scenes are dramatic and invigorating, character interaction is humorous when it needs to be and serious when it’s warranted, and the art is BEAUTIFUL. Having the different breaths be represented by “paintings” that only we, the viewer, can see is amazingly unique and adds a unique flair to the show. Also having everyone use a custom tailored katana that reflects their personality is metal as f*ck. The brother-sister relationship is wholesome and goes no further than family and sexual love doesn’t ever really pop up which is good because it doesn’t especially have a place in this show and universe. There are stakes and consequences to everything that happens the moment Tanjiro steps into frame. Speaking of tanjiro, he is incredibly energetic and carries the show on his back. You always want to cheer for him and it feels awesome to see him succeed. The only real weakness that I can really identify is that the beginning few episodes have a “monster of the week” feeling that I didn’t really like and that there are frequent time-skips which kinda mess up the pacing. It doesn’t really get in the way of the show though, and the monster thing clears up when more powerful enemies show up that our main characters can’t defeat alone. Oh also our friend “lightning boi” is annoying as all hell and the scenes where he is constantly crying left a sour taste in my mouth.I have watched all 26 episodes and couldn’t wait any longer so I binged all of the available 175 chapters and it really only goes uphill from where the show ends. I am praying for a season 2 and anxiously anticipate the movie’s release.",5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"Honestly it is my opinion that this is the BEST anime thats come out in a while! The story is excellent, the characters well written, a pretty good blend of seriousness and humor, amazing animation, and the feelings it brings out is a refreshing experience. Most would say the worst part about this show is Zenitsu but even he has a decent plot and it seems like they may tone down his sporadicness come season 2. The final episode he was more of a normal character. All in all I LOVE it and highly recommend to people. I can't wait for the dvd to come out, this show has amazing rewatch ability as well. Please experience this show.Edit: I read some of the 3 and 4 star reviews, most were written it seems after only 4 episodes or so, and some of them don't even complain about the show but about how they hate having to wait week by week (which in my opinion means its doing a great job by keeping you interested. Others complain about the show because they have questions about it, while if they would have waited they would have had those questions answered, or have been able to reasonably inference the answers. Basically the jumped the gun on reviewing the show, I hope they watched it fully and hope they change their review accordingly. But in the end I am happy to see the amount of love this show has gotten from people.",5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,Okay when i said i would sacrifice my minecraft dog i went a little to far but this is really one of the best series i've ever seen.It has some godlike animation with a really cool and specical style to it (just wait until ep 19).Has the most awesome set of characters iv'e ever seen in a anime.Everything just works so well in the story and you don't get tired of it.I'm glad that the season 2 has been confirmed and i really look forward to seeing another 26 episodes i hope.It's like eating a bag of chips.The more you eat of it the better it gets.,5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"Demon Slayer is a Japanese manga series, which was published by Koyoharu Gotouge, which is his 2nd work. An anime television series adaptation by Ufotable premiered on April 6, 2019. The final episode aired on September 28, 2019. From the earliest times, the humanity knows about human-flesh eating monsters, lurking in the darkness to devour an unfortunate soul that does not trust rumors. However, the rumors also mention an elite corps of demon hunters, skilled assassins, killing demons. Demon Slayer focuses on Tanjirou Kamado, who is still very young, but is the only man in his family. One day, Tanjirou decides to go down to the local village to make a little money, selling charcoal. When he returns back, he becomes an unwilling part of these horrifying rumors: his family is slaughtered and the only survivor, his sister Nezuko, is turned into demon. For some reason, Nezuko still acts as a human, which is the reason for Tanjirou to join demon slayers and cure his sister. Will he manage to join the elite corps and cure his sister?It is, without a doubt, quite a challenge to make an interesting and new battle shounen. With so many titles that represent the genre, as well as cliché surrounding it, Kimetsu no Yaiba could have been another title, everyone will stop to hype about after the first week. However, there is something different about it, which makes it stand out. The story-line is slow, which grants enough development, the main protagonist does look like your average battle-shounen protagonist, but he is not as annoying as his counterparts, characters are actually interesting, since even supporting cast receives enough development, finally, the setting looks somewhat new, because you will not see that often a setting, describing the Taishou era. Animation wise, it is quite challenging to find even one work of ufotable with bad animation. It does look somewhat similar to Katanagatari, but not quite. Everything from character designs to action scenes looks just awesome and beautiful, an eye candy you want to never end. Sound wise, even if there is English dub one day, I would still highly recommend you to watch Demon Slayer subbed, because of many voice acting gurus, voicing this series. Even the OST fits the anime well and makes the series even more catchy.Characters is another important part, a must to make battle-shounen likeable. Kamado Tanjirou, however, does not look that promising to ‘carry’ the whole series. However, this problem is solved when he is joined by the other protagonists of the series, who together form a very likeable group of protagonist. They are interesting, because of how different they are: Tanjirou Kamado is a very trustworthy and hardworking individual, but he is a too trustful. Nezuko Kamado, Tanjirou’s sister and the only person that was able to remain human after having been turned into a demon. The noodle head Zenitsu Agatsuma is a member of the Demon Killing Corps and a traveling companion of Kamado Tanjirou. He is always scared by any noise, but he becomes a fearful enemy for the demons, when it is needed. Inosuke Hashibira is the last companion of Tanjurou and he is also a t..p.  Enjoyment wise, it is truly one of the brightest gems of this season. Kimetsu no Yaiba is one of these titles that was able to unite comedy and drama and make it interesting to watch. What I mean is that many series were trying to do that, but failed. One was intervening with the other and the end result was horrible. Here, however, just like in Gintama, it is both funny and dramatic sometimes, which makes it that good. Imagine 26 episodes of nothing but drama. This is just unreal for any person. Overall, Kimetsu no Yaiba is one of a very small amount of battle-shounen series that is actually fun to watch. The story, the art, the voice acting, the OST, I cannot think of anything, I did not like about it, nor have I ever felt bored, when I was watching this series. There are, however, some minor flaws, I feel useless to even mention. Great job, Gotouge Koyoharu. For your first animated series, Demon Slayer is quite an achievement to be proud of. A very-very weak 10/10.",5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"Demon Slayer has a lot of things going for it. A decent start, amazing visuals, good music/opening/ending and a very high quality Main Character. Its pretty much the Goblin Slayer of Shounen this season. Its somewhat gory and mature, but with some immature elements as well (mostly the other demon slayer characters)What makes the show good - I really enjoy the brother/sister relationship as it give the entire story a good end goal to strive for from the very first episode and gives many moments of feel-good atmosphere despite the fairly dark setting/atmosphere. In fact those precious moments feel all the more powerful because of the dark setting. The fighting is really enjoyable to watch as well as most of the characters.The Passion. The feelings of the characters are very real and good anime really pull us in and make the world/characters/emotions feel truly real. Demon Slayer has a lot of emotion in every plot-line as well as the setting.What lowers the enjoyment -The pacing. Sometimes its perfect and flows really well. Other times we experience a time skip. Then we get lost in the hell that many shounen anime suffer. The studio tries to draw out battles/conversations/plot-lines for way too long. Fortunately Demon Slayer is such a quality show it can overcome the slow paced areas, but it definitely hampers the show's quality and sometimes i find myself finishing an episode thinking ""wait thats it? nothing happened!"" The blonde haired character. Hes just horrible as a character and massively annoying to have to listen to as he mostly just screams and cries. I get it that this is a shounen and a childish/loud/flamboyant character is almost always present, but he just feels poorly written and throw into the story to give comic relief. Instead the relief is when his scenes are over. Fortunately there aren't that many of them as of yet.My verdict:Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba is a great show. It has few flaws and it easily overwhelms them with its great story, visuals and passion. The brother/sister bond is amazingly portrayed and gives us a true sense of what family really means.",5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"Can't heap enough praise on this series. Great story, Great characters and relational development, solid background and theory. amazing art and drawing, and fantastic fights. Each character is different and interesting, not just weird for the sake of being ""different"".  And the character's maintain their personalities, unlike many that have them change at the drop of a hat. You see real character development, not just personality changes that leave you thinking ""wut just happened?""This show raises the bar on what defines a quality anime, well worth the watch. Warning: first episode is dark. it sets the stage for the motivations behind the main heroes. So if it's a bit too dark for you, stick with it. It gets better, and the whole theme through the series is a positive one.",5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"Holy cow, where do I even start? The animation quality is leagues above everything else. It's so rare for me to see an anime with such good animation every episode that I wonder how much money went into the production of this. I feel like every episode has 3-4x the budget of your typical anime. The visual quality never disappoint and I love the artistic direction. UFOTABLE is my new favorite studio.",5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"I have been waiting for a really good anime to come out since attack on titans taking days. This anime is soooo good. Gave me so much chills, the plot is everything I love it!!! The animes that has come out lately lacks a good addictive story line so I'm glad this one came out. There's so much potential, the first episode will capture you right away and you know an anime is good if you get hooked right off the bat. 100% recommend watching this, no regrets. I can't wait for the next episode, currently on 19 and so far the best episode yet! Had to rewatch it. Anyways you will love this, I promise.",5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"I was hesitant to watch this series because I feel like every new anime that comes out with this kind of premise is either cliche, bland, overly ecchi, poorly done, or all of the above... but booooyyyy/giiiiiirrrrrllll, I'll tell you what I FEEL SO STUPID FOR NOT GIVING THIS SERIES A CHANCE SOONER. I was instantly impressed and captivated with the beauty and design of this show. I haven't seen top notch animation like this in a good while. I was then impressed about how quickly they got into the plot and story-line. This show is a real attention grabber! The plot itself is so dark/tragic, but somehow with the characters they're able to keep the story-line so fun/uplifting. Highly recommend! PLEASE DO YOURSELF A FAVOR and WATCH THIS SHOW!",5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"I have few words to describe this show other than as an animated masterpiece. The storyline is complex and on the darker end, with beautifully crafted character development. Every single one of the characters is important, and any scene they appear in adds to my understanding of their past and personality. And don't get me started on the visuals. Every scene is beautiful, like a literal masterpiece. I don't want it to end and if they don't tie the story up at the end of these 26 episodes (which I don't think they will based on the progress made by ep 19) I would love to see more seasons. Immaculate. That's all I can say",5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"It's not fair how much this anime gets right. Now let me start off with saying that I'm not too much into anime as I have only really gotten into it as of last year. That being said, I have watched classic movies and shows that most people really enjoy and seem to take a strong bond to. This particular show however.. man. It has absolutely astonishing writing, better than any video game or show has ever even been close to. The art style and Tokugawa period setting never gets old. Each character has a carefully scripted background making it so they all feel different and absolutely no one is disliked. Even the random villains the main character faces all have their own stories to tell, and when he finally triumphs over them its always a mixture of sadness and happiness..The thing that really takes this anime over the top for me, making it my favorite of all time. Putting it above Spirited Away, Naruto, One Hero, Cowboy Bebop and many of my other all time classic favorites is its pure sense of engagement. I have never been more engrossed and had that feeling of ""being there"" more than I do in this show, the only thing that really could compare is that same feeling when you watch the first episode of SAO. It's addictive. I genuinely love and adore all of the characters on this show, good and bad. Seeing the main character grow with the viewer and get stronger and stronger not due to some outside factor, but under his own will is amazing. The pacing is fantastic. But as I said above, it's the shows attention to detail in every character they put on screen and their personal story and how it ties into the main heros quest is the real gem of this show. TLDR:I've never seen a show, book, or movie with this kind of writing. It's a whole new way to engage an audience without the need for action all the time. The animation is phenomenal. The character development is astonishing. 20/10 Watch this show.",5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"It is a heart warming story about a very complicated brother-sister bond that originated from tragic circumstances isolated out in the woods. The brother keeps his ball gagged sister in a box that he carries on his back and only brings her out at night when he needs her. He does this in order to prevent her from eating random strangers after a stranger ate her and gave her an infection. The in order to seek revenge on the stranger, he indoctrinates himself into a cult that chops baddies into pieces using katanas. During his indoctrination he leaves his incapacitated and victimized sister with a strange old man who successfully brain washers her.",5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"One of the best anime ever produced. Every episode makes you feel emotions from all ranges. Few anime have a protagonist that truly makes your skin crawl and fills you with rage. Each episode is filled with beauty and leaves you wanting for more. They never use cheap tactics and unnecessary cliff hangers to keep you coming back. Episodes are taken to their conclusion and you return because of the want to see more, not a need to see completion. Everything about this anime is wonderful.",5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,Animation on point. Music on point. I really enjoy the character design and the world design. A time or two per episode the scenery animation looks nearly real I've had to double take multiple time... There isn't unnecessary prolonged fighting sequences everything combat related seems reasonable in this world. Characters are very compelling and as dark as the show can be it seems pretty light. 5/5 stars,5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"((DO NOT READ SPOILER TILL AFTER EP 4!))This anime, I have to say.., Is the  BEST ANIMATED ANIME I've ever seen!! The fighting scenes seem as if they are in 3D! I feel like every anime I watch from now on will feel poor-qualitied! I wish to cosplay so many characters!(Listed Below) I just love the relationships and the current antagonists and enemies, they are factored so well, and the MC is not too OP!Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideI would go broke to cosplay Sabito or Tanjiro! I hated Sabito's death scene!! Bring my soft baby back for more scenes!!",5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"Pros- Hits the ground running with an amazing first episode- Really unique art style that works well for the atmosphere- Great setting and world-building, feels like a folktale- Unique characters, each person has their own personality and is given the right dialogue- Each episode is structured very well, by the end you either get a cliffhanger or a really satisfying feeling- Can we take a second to appreciate the animation of the special moves each slayer gets. Its honestly dope.- The plot so far has a great arc to it. MC wants to make his sister human again, has to search for the person who can make demons to learn more. Simple, but really interesting.  - OP is really good in my opinion, also the sound design and soundtrack really makes the whole folktale vibe pop.- Doesn't shy away from more vulgar themes.- I'm interested in how they're gonna make senses into a theme. For example, Tanjiro has a really good sense of smell, the Yellow haired kid has great hearing, etc. Haven't really seen that all that much before.Cons- Doesn't really explain why Nezuko can survive without eating flesh. It'll probably get covered more later but its kind of annoying having to play along with the fact that she can just sleep to regain strength. To be honest they're doing a really great job so far and any other cons I can think of would be easily cleared up in future episodes. I highly recommend this one, its definitely the best spring anime this season.",5

demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"I've been following Kimetsu no Yaiba since the manga originally premiered 3 years ago in Weekly Shonen Jump. While the premise is simple, the execution has always been fantastic with a great story, great characters, great fight scenes, you name it. It has everything you can ask for in a shonen series.The manga was a little rough around the edges in terms of artwork, but that's expected when this is the writer's (Koyoharu Gotōge) first series that she's ever worked on, and it not only got serialized in Jump, but it ended up getting this anime adaptation by Ufotable, the studio that brought us Kara no Kyoukai, Fate/Zero, and Fate/stay night Unlimited Blade works and Heaven's Feel!Kimetsu no Yaiba is easily the best new series to come from Jump in a long time! Highly recommended!",5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"The art directors and writers of this anime are knocking it out of the park week after week. The story draws you in immediately and unfolds in a manner that keeps you excited and drooling like a hungry demon for more. Tanjiro's kind heart, strong spirit and misfortune make him the hero you will get behind root for with all your emotion. The well devised storytelling is complimented by fun action, humor, unique character design, a cool illustrative style, and shot angles that create beautiful visuals that are fun and exciting. Every frame is well constructed, bringing into clear focus how much care is put in by the artists and directors. Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba has got the special sauce and I hope the production team keeps this one dipped because this is anime is A-1!!",5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"I went into the first episode completely blind. The only thing I knew was LOTS of people online were excited for it. The cover artwork looked cool and instantly grabbed my attention. The animation and style of the anime looks impressive (at least to me) and of course with the first episode it introduces the MC. I'm sure to some he comes off as generic and boring, but clearly we are going to get a lot of character growth as the series progresses. I'm really looking forward to following the series as I do have high expectations for it based off what I saw in the first episode and from what I saw in the opening theme song as well.",5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"I remember reading the manga few years ago and just hoping it's going to become an anime. Honestly, the anime adaptation looks amazing, voice are not far fetch from what I imagined or find suit and so far the sound track and animation are great.Also, the anime character adaptations do stick with the manga and I am so glad they did (therefore I was actually able to recognise that I read the manga).",5
demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba,"One of the better anime to come out in the last couple years, despite some serious plot flaws, and thanks to some exceptional art and animation. The series starts off with a brutal bang. The protagonist's family is attacked by demon(s). He's survived because he was not at home. All the rest are dead, save his sister. She's suffered a fate worse than death, as she's been turned into a demon herself. Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideThis is a bit disconcerting, as demons can only survive by eating humans. But through some inexplicable twist, Nezuko can somehow miraculously thwart her demonic nature, by sticking a hunk of bamboo in her mouth.  Her devoted  brother, Tanjiro, vows to reverse the demonic transformation, willing to go to any lengths to do so. Which means hunting down the nasty boss daddy demon, and maybe asking him nicely to turn Nezuko back. We don't know because the narrative never gets that far. In yet another inexplicable twist, Tanjiro decides that joining an organization sworn to kill demons would be the natural route to find this guy. Why he doesn't think they won't immediately off his sister is beyond me. Even more puzzling is that when she is exposed, the Demon Slayers don't immediately do just that. Yeah, it's pretty implausible, but please stick with the series, as it does have it's redeeming values.  Tanjiro as a character gets some decent development. Nezuko, not so much, but then she's not entirely 2 dimensional, either. The designs for the various demons they encounter are the real stars here, and they tend to get a lot deeper treatment and development than most of the protagonists. The supporting cast are pretty much your typical shounen motley crew. With one exception, there's not much original or stand out here. The one exception, though, jumped near to the top of my ""most love to hate"" characters. God, I wish they had killed Zenitsu off in the same episode he first appeared in, he's such an irritating little [email protected] It would have been so satisfying to have seen some demon munching his entails.You don't want to watch Demon Slayer for the plot or the characters anyway. The artwork all around is top notch, especially the character designs. They aren't ground-shatteringly original, but there is something about them that is above and beyond the usual, uninspired, shounen designs. Background work is inspired though, and lends much to the overall atmosphere of the episodes. Whether in a woods, the mountains, or a city, they are a crucial part of the narrative. The animation is also a cut above. While the action scenes get the greatest, and therefore the most inspired, attention, check out the other scenes as well. There were a lot of times I saw something that might not have seemed too consequential, but it made me stop and say ""Nice Job!"" And the CGI work is to be highly commended. The other studios will be studying Demon Slayer, for sure. The voice actors did a nice job of conveying the emotions of a scene, without going too over the top, where you frequently see other shounens jumping the shark. With the issues in the narrative, it's hard to give the director too much credit, but given what the writers gave him to work with, he did the best he could. It's apparent that he had the most say in the action scenes, and those are done very, very well. Dialog is well done, flows smoothly, and is emotionally congruent with what is happening in the scenes. Another kudo for the director was his use of the soundtrack. It's used very well to set the atmosphere of almost every scene, and I can't remember any where the soundtrack detracted from what was happening on-screen.Other than the messed up narrative, almost everything else about this series impressed me with it's quality. But even as messy as the narrative was, I walked away looking forward to there being another season. If I could, Demon Slayer would get 84/100. A very solid 4 star effort overall.",4
hunter-x-hunter,"The first couple of episodes might seem kinda corny too some and yeah they are somewhat generic, but stick with it.This isn't some kids show, it's actually very mature and dark(just the right amount though)It has an excellent story and doesn't have to rely on explosions or huge breasted women to keep going, it has a bit of everything really it's like a more modern version of Dragonball, an adventure.But instead of being all about Gon other characters get the spotlight for a good while too everyone get's an adequate amount of character development, even people who die shortly after appearing.Seriously give this a go, I have no idea why it's not as popular as the likes of Naruto and One Piece it's way more interesting than both in my opinion.",5
hunter-x-hunter,"- WRITTEN WHILST STILL WATCHING, AT EPISODE 65 -The first word that comes to mind when I think about Hunter x Hunter is undoubtedly: VARIETY. With everything from insane, heart-raising action to comedy so ridiculous that I laugh alone in my room on numerous occasions; Hunter x Hunter is an anime that quickly shot to my number 1 favorite and only secures it's place more determinedly with every episode.At this point, although still ongoing, I'm roughly halfway through HxH and I've loved every single minute of it. That's because in this show, every minute matters. You can't look away without missing something crucial, hilarious or just generally entertaining. I was a late comer to the HxH bandwagon and after around 10 episodes, I was sorely angered with myself for leaving it this late. All I can say now is thank heavens I finally gave this anime a shot. NEWCOMERS. DO NOT BE PUT OFF BY THE LENGTH. WHEN YOU START WATCHING; IT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER ANYMORE. Where I first found myself concerned as to whether I'd have the time or motivation to catch up with this anime, I now find myself worried about catching up and having to wait a week for each episode! And man, do those episodes fly by. The best anime are the ones that make it impossible to say 'okay, that's enough for now'. The array of interesting and unique characters is what really makes this series. HxH is not afraid to go with the cliche, make fun of the cliche, experiment with the dark and creepy, the light and fluffy, and everything in between. With 2 adorable yet terrifyingly powerful protagonists and their ever-changing company, you're guaranteed to come across multiple characters that you love, hate or just plain can't get your head around. But even without the constantly growing cast, Gon and Killua really do make this a special anime. Watching the two grow (albeit quite quickly with the pace of the anime) and experiencing all the WONDERS OF FRIENDSHIP AND SELF DISCOVERY is easily the main reason for my love of this anime. Not forgetting, of course, creepy-ass perv Hisoka on the side is just the cherry on the cake.Overall this anime is just plain fun. It's addictive, interesting, varied and entertaining in every sense of the word. It really is an anime that has something for everyone. WATCH IT.",5
hunter-x-hunter,"Hunter X Hunter is a remake of the classic anime that aired in the mid 90's and it follows the manga storyline.The story is about Gon Freecss whose goal is to find his father Ging who is a renowned double star hunter.Along the way he meets Kurapika, A sole survivor of the Kurta clan who was exterminated by the mafia group Phantom Troupe led by Chrollo Lucilfer, Leorio, A hunter aiming to be a doctor and Killua who is a hunter in the elite Zoldyck family of assassins.Together they set out to take the Hunter Exam and Gon's quest to become a legendary hunter begins.The storyline itself is complex with a huge cast and an understandable approach of the history of the series.This anime has large acclaims of continuing the storyline after the Greed Island Arc. Overall a fantastic anime series that has just bought to be shown here on Crunchyroll",5
hunter-x-hunter,"I don't make that statement lightly.  Yes, I am quite biased, but I don't give the series such reverance just 'cause.There is a reason that Togashi can take multiple year+ long hiatus's with the manga, and yet still have a loyal following.HunterxHunter is just that excellent.  The series is a subversion of typical shounen tropes, playing in blue and orange morality.  You root for the villians in many ways just as much as the leads.  You don't have insane boring speeches on morality or 'right and wrong', instead you have an exploration of a world.  And the fighting dynamics are immensly complex.The ""power of friendship"" isn't going to save you in HxH, but wit and guile shall.The story does start off slow, but even before you are introduced to nen, it is easy to see how HxH is different.And the Chimera Ant Arc makes it clear just how different.  In many ways I feel calling that arc 'shounen' does a disservice to it.  No shounen works so hard on charactarization of the villians.  At all.  You instead tend to get quick mash ups and 'flash backs' for a never before relevant back story and some sappy 'you're now good!' moment.  HxH doesn't indulge in such nonsense.  Character arcs are developed organically, according to the established nature of the character.  It's story telling 101, something often lost in today's 'action dominated' world.If you're looking for a non-stop action anime, HxH will often feel anti-climactic.  That's the point.Finally the music, and animation given to the arc in this remake pays full respect to the source material.  I can't imagine what it would be like to have to wait each week to find out what will come next, I understand how Song of Ice and Fire readers feel watching the show...Regardless of if you read the manga or not, HunterxHunter is a work that deserves significantly more appreciation for the beauty of the series. Togashi doesn't need to write another page in his life and still live quite comfortably.  (He's got Yu Yu Hakusho, Level E, and is married to Naoko Takeuchi.  He does not need to work).That gives him ultimate freedom in crafting HxH.  Freedom he takes, while we wait.And we wait.  But we will keep waiting, so long as he keeps writing.  HxH is just that excellent.",5
hunter-x-hunter,"First of all I want to point out that this anime has a slow start and progression. I stopped watching it a little bit before I reached 15 episodes, but I continued one day because I figured I should keep going. The main characters don't get actual power progression until very later on, but it keeps you reeled with it's beautiful animations [Madhouse] THE ANIMATION IS ALWAYS ON POINT EVERY SINGLE EPISODE AND ONLY GET'S BETTER THROUGH 130+ episodes. I've never said once ""Man the animation there doesn't look that great."" or ""The guy in the background isn't that detailed"". And the results of the slow progression rewards you beyond belief, you'll be taken through so many loops and emotions it will make you question the most explicate of details. The Chimera Ant arc (The latest and best arc) is EXTREMELY dark, it hits you out of nowhere in this bright world of Hunter x Hunter, and it stays a dark world from there on out, and it's amazing. It's a Shōnen that doesn't really abide to the Shōnen rules, and you'll like that for the better. I watch alot of Shōnen so I've been around the block quite a few times, but believe me when I tell you this is probably one of the best decisions I ever made to get involved with this insanely incredible anime.",5
hunter-x-hunter,"It starts off like any other light-hearted shonen anime. Then... an uneasy feeling. Murderous children raised on torture and suffocating control, an entire clan, man, woman, and child wiped out except for one sole survivor, unique and interesting characters start dying like flies left and right- WHAT IS GOING ON? There aren't any happy endings here folks, you're watching hunter x hunter. And you couldn't be more entertained if you tried. An absolute masterpiece and how any manga adaptation should be done. top notch voice acting, animation, and storytelling lay the foundation. A unique, heavily expounded upon combat system and cast make this one of if not the  most involved watches you will ever take part in. And best of all? literally just two episodes of filler. very obvious, very skippable filler at that.live it, love it, start binge watching now! NOW! I can't say enough good things about hunter x hunter 2011.",5
hunter-x-hunter,"Sometimes it's almost hard to take your mind off the insane battles long enough to get and laugh at the occasional zingers. The show almost never fails to deliver the right balance and contrast in emotional highs and lows, carefree sentimentality and seriousness. When Hunter x Hunter does fail to satisfy immediately (as in the brutally slow narrated part of the Chimera Ant arc) you'll still find yourself dumbstruck by the weird technical analysis of each motive, attack, and response of each battle, often backed up with a deep analysis of the underlying psychological and emotional struggles the characters are going through, and also often accompanied by absurdly detailed engineering illustrations or other cerebral interjections. It all flows together so smoothly it's almost addictive. No -- it IS addictive. And it's hard to knock what basically amounts to brutally cliffhanging suspense. Especially when it has you feverishly scrambling to view the next episode, and the next, and the next, until you realize you just Hunter x Hunter'd the night away and it's time to ""wake up"" already.There are numerous power pay-offs that will have you cheering for your favorite characters, but sometimes when the story seems to drag you realize it's just the tone and the setting. When there's so much big stuff going on overhead you almost don't want to spend the time paying attention to the little soul-searching moments of seemingly unimportant minor characters. If you're impatient, you might find yourself yelling out loud at the apparently oblivious and deranged little characters who have been hogging the screen for several episodes. That in itself is really funny. But all of that super-heavy emotionalism is perhaps the show's greatest strength. That and the puzzles, twists, power engineering, and constant deep strategizing coming from all sides at once all the time. The art? Oh, that. Well, the artwork glitters and gleams with a sort of weird combination of crisp newness and almost retro-styled, psychedelic shimmering and sparkling effects. The animation never seems flat or boring, everything ""pops"". Every last ounce of human effort is squeezed into every frame. When you get to the narration part of the Chimera Ant arc, you're going to feel like tearing the screen out of the wall because it's just. So. Slow. But it actually gets meta-humorous how over-the-top the narrator is in giving every little thing that's happening its own little world of the utmost, self-centered importance. This is the first anime I've watched that has actually had me cackling in madness.",5
hunter-x-hunter,"Hunter x Hunter is the definition of perfection. The characters, music, visuals, story line and art style are all astonishing.Visuals The visuals stay nothing less than mind blowing. Absolutely amazing animation. A lot of anime's in this genre, especially ones that are based around a lot of combat and go over 100 episodes, tend to get a little sloppy with presentation after a while. However Hunter x Hunter makes all those anime's look like trash when comparing them.Music The music nailed everything. I listen to Hunter x Hunter music everyday, and never get bored of it. Some OST's are so emotional, tears run down your face from just hearing them. Others are so epic, it's as if it forces you to turn you volume to full so you can appreciate and experience the awesomeness of a piece.characters There is not a single character that i ever felt was annoying or had no purpose or were not developed enough. Even the smaller roles and extras, all had so much detail into their design and personality. This anime makes you really get to know every single person and have some sort of relationship with them.Protagonists The four protagonists: Gon, Killua, Kuapika and Leorio are the heart and soul of this anime. Especially Gon and Killua. Seeing the two total opposites make a tight relashionship, and watching it grow is really the bread and butter of the story. One coming from a happy childhood and another from brutal torture; there was nothing to make this any better. They all have their goals and dreams and its amazing watching them develop through their many adventures with and without each other.Storyline The story line is on a different level to anything i have ever read, seen or watched in my lifetime. The story is so mind blowing, so shockingly elaborate, you will never be bored. For a 148 episodes, to never have one of them bore you seems impossible, however this one does it to perfection. The contrast of moods and genres change so swiftly it all works together perfectly. The beginning feels like your watching a happy family friendly anime. But by episode 50, it becomes so gory, so violent, so intense, even adults look away or get extremely hype. Morals The greatest aspect of this is that its not just a fight against good and evil. Sometimes to roles of evil swap between the protagonists and their rivals.All the characters are human and suffer through difficulties of life. Whatever those are, it can make someone a good person or a bad person. Watching the righteous and the unrighteous swap roles is really breath taking. It even makes you question your own goodness, or whether if we as a human race have any at all. Conclusion After watching this anime, it is hard to watch anything else in its genre, as everything looks unpolished and unfinished in comparison. I rated it 5/5, as i feel nothing i have watched, can top it in the aspects of characters, visuals, music and art style. Hunter x Hunter is the best anime out there.",5
hunter-x-hunter,"So by this point many of the tropes that are common in shonen are annoyances to me. This is why Hunter x Hunter was such a wonderful surprise. The many tropes that this show avoids include.1. Every problem can be solved by training2. Beat me once, shame on me and I'm guaranteed to win next time3. Hard work > Experience4. Everything is stronger when it's a beam attack5. The next enemy will be just strong enough for us to scrape by.6. The guys we're fighting now are simply the best around, until next arc7. You're either evil or redeemable8. The main character is the one that will resolve thisand many many others.This anime is beyond refreshing, it's spectacular. As of this moment it's one of my top three anime of all time. Because it's not just good shonen. It's top quality anime.",5
hunter-x-hunter,"After having only watched this anime three days ago and finally making it to the present state of the show all i can say is that this show is absolutely amazing, with both very interesting characters, and a story with so much depth and creativity to make some say ""Just one more episode"" over and over again! (another plus side some may consider is there is no filler, i personally wanted a few filler episodes to be honest though) the music is well made, the voice cast is very good... i honestly can't think of anything bad to say about this anime. all and all just brilliantWill edit this ""review"" eventually. A byproduct of an uncontrollable state of euphoria.",5
hunter-x-hunter,"I was in a pretty dark place when I found Hunter x Hunter. I was having trouble laughing and seeing the positivity in life. However, when I started watching this anime I began smiling again, and I couldn't help but fall in love with the characters and plot. The first couple episodes are pretty corny, but as the story progresses it gets better and better. I could never handle long running anime like  One Piece, Bleach, and Naruto, yet I adore this one. The anime is long but each season is a whole new story with a whole new set of interesting characters ready to greet you. My favorite aspect of the series is that even the secondary characters get back story, and you can't help but liking them even when they are the villain. The complexity and thought in this series is wonderful and worth watching all the episodes.",5
hunter-x-hunter,"Don't read these reviews to convince you to watch the anime - stop now and watch it this instant. It has a high rating across the internet and is one of my most favourite shows. Don't be fooled by the 'weak' looking characters because it was those very reasons why I never touched this show or not decide to watch it. But I regret not having watched this any sooner. Heck, the characters are amazing and the storyline and arcs never cease to amaze me. If i were to order my top 3 shounen HxH would be at number 1 then FMAB followed by one piece. This is a gem and the only negative is the fact that it ended so, by all means go and watch this already.",5
hunter-x-hunter,"It s not just the story in the case that grows in to this amazing series, but the animation is something to marvel at, it just turns into this incredible art work that you can't help but stare at. There is 150 million reviews with over 5 stars on why you should start watching hunter x hunter, its nothing something to miss while you still have time to catch up, we are in this for the long haul. This is truly an amazing series, I do pray that we get many many more seasons, 9 or 10 would be fine with me.",5
hunter-x-hunter,"Let me start by saying I wrote this show off for the longest time. The art-style looked a bit flat from the promo-images, the characters looked like a mish-mash of stereotypes, and the main protagonist used a freaking fishing pole as his primary weapon. It looked like pretty generic shonen-schlock aimed at the elementary and middle-school age bracket. I was wrong. The series is up-beat and happy, especially early on, with a lot of the typical shonen themes of 'Friendship and Determination' to cover everything. The oft-pictured group looks on the surface like rag-tag stereotypes, with a super optimistic, somewhat naive protagonist, the 'last of his clan' on a quest for vengeance, the aloof skater, and the easily roiled businessman. The first two seem painfully generic and the last two kind of quirky at best. Not helped is the fact that it pretty much starts out on an extended obstacle course for its first arc. Lots of wacky vignettes and odd challenges, but not much in the way of a story beyond 'go for the prize at the end'. But through this arc, you get to know the characters, get a little insight into where they came from, get a feel for the scope of the kind of crazy things this setting can possibly throw at them. The secondary cast is every bit as wildly varied as you'd expect, but there are surprisingly few 'annoying schtick' characters. As time goes on you start to see the characters fleshed out nicely: The protagonist is not nearly as naive as he first seemed, the greedy businessman has a very distinct goal for his greed and a surprisingly charitable side, the aloof character is part of a well known and very dangerous family with tons of baggage to explore, and so forth. The group doesn't even remain a group for the arbitrary reasons many shonen shows have them do so. Some of them with their own goals split off to pursue them separately, and some go to catch up when they realize they can't keep pace with the methods their companions are using. The characters are given room to grow and show all sorts of facets of their personality in ways that feel natural and very fulfilling.  The animation starts off pretty good, and becomes simply amazing as time goes on. I'd say it hits its true peek during the next to last arc, with scenes that had me tense as I followed the character's struggle with built up hopes, determination pushed to the most unhealthy extremes, and surprisingly harsh lessons in mortality.  The emotional roller coaster the characters go through in this arc in particular are some of the best I've seen in anime ever, and the culmination in episode 135 brought me to actual tears in a way that nothing has since I was a kid watching 'The Land Before Time' for the first time. The entire show is seriously worth watching JUST to get to that point, in my opinion. My wife had very little context on the show, and rolled her eyes when I insisted she sit down for that one episode. By the end she was bawling and I was right back at that same point all over again. Don't spoil it for yourself though, watch at least the arc leading up to that point for the full effect, I promise your time will be well spent. I learned over the course of the last two arcs that the creator, Yoshihiro Togashi, has recently had some pretty severe health problems, and never put out the manga at a particularly fast pace even before then. While he does have plans to continue the series, and plans in place even should the worst happen, the fact of the matter is that this run of the anime is over for the foreseeable future. This is both a sad thought, and a somewhat reassuring one. The series ends with a peek into the scope of the places it could go, and a feeling of accomplishment for how far it's come. It doesn't leave you hanging on a cliff (Heh), but it did leave me curious to find out more. For those of you who want to see a long-running story line done well, without the worry of going through an archive binge only to run into a wall once you catch up, this series is a perfect way to enter a new fandom. So add it to your que, and get crunching. There will definitely be Something to Satisfy all tastes~",5
hunter-x-hunter,"my review title says it all. at more than 1100 reviews everyone else had already put in their two cents and there are a few very nicely done ones, so i'll just say this is the only thing worth turning on the tv for nowadays (actually i watch it on my pc, since it's not receiving air time here in cali, but it's hooked up on my tv, so ....). disregard the rather deceptively sweet-looking poster for the show -- this is as dark as they come for an anime not receiving a teen+17 rating. all i can say is, you might have better use for your time than watching this 130+ epi series, but once you do decide to invest yourself in it, it is one helluva ride.",5
hunter-x-hunter,"Ignore the Kanye jab. But seriously if you've seen Full Metal Alchemist and seen how well a remake can be done...this is SO much better in terms of full ""remake"" impact. The original anime is great (really really great), but this one is alot longer with a more concrete + fast paced following of the manga.Also people who are saying it has slowed down are quite wrong. I've read the manga and the buildup I'm having internally for the Chimera Ant Arc is killing me. Trust me start watching now. The best fights of the entire anime will literally be starting the next episode and I cannot wait. 1. These fights are not in the original anime.2. These fights were horribly drawn in the manga.3. The animation for Hunter x Hunter 2011 is some of the most fluid and beautiful looking animations out there. The fights scenes are totally insane already.In sum...This anime has been great from the start and just keeps getting BETTER.Also just so you know that I'm not just some raving ""fight"" loving anime fanboy...you should know what really makes Hunter X Hunter the best is its intricate undertone of darkness. Just the way that this show makes you think about what it takes to lose humanity, what it takes to change, what it means to be a person. There's really nothing else like this anime. Sorry for the ramble but episode 110 really got me excited.",5
hunter-x-hunter,"I, like other people, judged this anime from the get go - and didn't even bother watching the first episode. I saw the cover picture and just was like ""how on earth can this be popular on crunchyroll?"" and just left it at that. Months later one of my university friends had mentioned that this was currently her favorite anime and I, being the ever curious kid, decided to give it a go. Damn, was I wrong about this one, boy oh boy was I. I have no doubt in my mind that this is one of the best animes out so far - excelling at everything from it's story line to its amazing characters!Please give it a go - its worth your while ^_^",5
hunter-x-hunter,"I think this has become my favorite anime of all time, partially because of nostalgia, and partially because it's that awesome. The first anime I ever got into was Dragonball Z, in middle school. Hunter x Hunter appeals to me now in the same way Dragonball Z used to when I was younger. It's not as 'do the right thing because its the right thing to do' though. In fact, a lot of times, it's pretty fucked up, but it's still so light-hearted that your morality doesn't take a hit. I can't really describe how much I love this anime.",5
hunter-x-hunter,"When I first watched this I thought it was some bright and happy kiddy show... I was wrong.Amazing story - Really good and entertaining arcs, which kept me on the edge of my seat.Characters - The main characters are all amazing. You will have your favourite/s. Mine was def Killua due to the amount of bad ass scenes which had me pausing the video due to me having to have to take a breather. All the characters have a background which is discussed quite a bit in the anime. In addition, some of the villains were so damn good, I was constantly wondering if a certain character was good or bad due to their actions with our MC's.Overall - I really recommend this masterpiece of an anime. It was an amazing watch and I am sure to watch this again!",5
hunter-x-hunter,"If you are a beginner to this anime, don't think twice. Just start watching. Tell yourself to make it past the hunter exam arc. I feel like the anime just gets better and better with each episode (not one of them was boring, no fillers, no misunderstandings,, no big breasted women and fast well-thought out pacing) This anime has made me laugh like crazy, stopped my heart with excitement for six episodes continuously and weep as though I had lost everyone I ever knew. Four key things are perfect in this anime - 1)  the writing or the story or the dialogue whatever you call it 2) the animation and the details  3) voice acting and realistic emotions portrayed (shout out to Knov's and Meruem's voice actors for epic scenes in episodes 106 and 135. shudder... such beautiful scenes) and 4) the character development of each and every single person (seriously it's mind blowing how genius the author was).  If I haven't convinced you enough, just give it a chance for falling in love with that beautiful face Killua has. (he is such a badass, you will thank me later) And if you are a returning hunter x hunter fan, you must be wanting to pass on the love or must be going through withdrawal now that the anime is over. But fear not, we shall keep hoping that we will meet again and that Togashi keeps drawing. A silent salute to you all.",5
hunter-x-hunter,"Hunter x Hunter looks childish, I admit, that's what first popped into my mind. But trust me, as I stuck with this I became emotionally attached, and when it ended, I was completely devastated.Please don't over look this, please continue watching it, you'll be so amazed. It's variety as a show is what put it at the top for me. The characters, even if they are a little op, stick with you, and trust me, it's one of those shows you'll never forget. I would recommend Hunter x Hunter to anyone who watches anime, the type of genre they prefer wouldn't matter because HxH has something for everyone. This is one show that you won't regret watching.",5
hunter-x-hunter,"Simply put, this is the best anime series on Crunchyroll. Hands down. Based on the manga by Yoshihiro Togashi and animated brilliantly by Studio Madhouse, Hunter x Hunter (2011) is a captivating anime series that simply feels different from any other shonen series, while still remaining staying true to the classic shonen formula. The show contains the familliar elements of friendship, adventure, effort and victory that are present in any shonen, but instead of taking the battle-heavy route that is so commonly seen in other shonen series like One Piece, Naruto or Dragon Ball, Hunter x Hunter instead places just as much if not more emphasis on themes normally seen in human dramas: character development, emotionnal and philosophical dilemmas, trickery, deceit and cunning against otherwise overwhelming forces, etc. This isn't very visble during the first arc, but as the series progresses, the pulse-pounding action-filled battles are just as often accompagnied with nerve-racking emotionnal rollercoasters rides. A must watch for any fan of anime who wants more than just: ""let's beat up the bad guy"".",5
hunter-x-hunter,"Put bluntly, just watch this anime. No it's not over hyped, it's simply that well written. All of the characters have some sort of development and you will feel for them as the story goes on. Hunter explores many dark themes as well, it's not just some kiddy show. It makes you question things about yourself, and look into morality of humanity as a whole. For me personally the show really shone a new light in my mind and how I view the world. It painted a picture of humanity and it's struggles perfectly and showed me something that I can't articulate with words. This show really is something special to me and I hope you go watch it and enjoy it as much as I did.",5
hunter-x-hunter,"While countless women and men were watching shows like Lost and Survivor, I was in my room watching anime. I know some of you were the same. Remember the original Hunter x Hunter? The original 90's anime was great. Good character development, excellent plot, comedy, etc were what made the first series so great. THIS SERIES IS NOT THE FIRST SERIES. It leaves the first series in the dust. As I watched every episode, I felt closer and closer to the characters. I expected something great. A nice remake of an old anime for a new generation. What I got was my life RUINED!!!!! The animation is beautiful. The japanese voice actors are perfect. Incredible fights, hilarious comedy, striking backdrops, and a real sense of adventure are simply a few things that make this near-perfect anime so amazing. It will make you not want to go to work or school and abandon everything for the world of Gon and Ging Freecss. VIEWER BEWARE. There is no anime-rehab. You are watching at your own risk. Anime this good should have a warning.",5
hunter-x-hunter,"An amazing storyline,internal struggles with awesome fights, sums up hxh. epic fight scenes with conflicts that question who you are as a human being, and the strategies holy shit this anime just the best... ﻿but the manga remains the better medium for HxH in my opinion. Togashi gives no shits about having seinen-type violence in a shounen series, It just gets brutal, also, the manga shows a lot more subtleties to the characters than the anime has shown.",5
hunter-x-hunter,"I didn't watch this show until now because the cover art appears a bit childish.  Boy was I wrong!  This series have some of the best characters.  Many of them are lovable whether they are good or ""evil"".  I was a big fan of Yu Yu Hakusho and I'm glad to see that this series is just as good as YYH - Togashi is as imaginative as ever, and the story is full of unpredictability - which is a great thing because you never know what to expect from him.  HxH also has a good balance of really dark and light hearted moments (some even hilarious).  I was never bored when I was watching this series.",5
hunter-x-hunter,"This is a remake of the 1999 series and because i watched the original i was skeptical. In no way did this show disappoint! The villian Hisoka is like no other i have seen, being tagged as creepy, bizarre, and a possible paedophile. Main characters are Gon Freecss, Killua Zoldyck, Leorio, and Kurapika.    Gon is a boy of 12 leaving his island to become a Hunter and find his dad. Finding his dad is no small feat; however, because his dad just happens to be the world's top Hunter. Gon quickly becomes friends with Killua, Kurapika, and Leorio. Rarely have I seen such a well matched and heartwarming pair as Gon and Killua. My words to descride: Gon- monster, beast, stubborn, simple, warm- Killua- monster, assassin, shadow, protective, loyal- Leorio- simple, tempermental, caring- Kurapika- cool, graceful, smart, analitical, loyal.    The show closely follows the manga and is supposed to go well past the original. If you are like me and have watched the original, and are skeptical about this re done version, please watch it! Even knowing what was going on, i instantly got absorbed. If you have not watched the original, I encourage you to do so. One of my favorite things is comparing the two. It makes the great things about each version more obvious.   Let Gon's journey to becoming a legendary Hunter begin!",5
hunter-x-hunter,"*Spoiler free review from someone who has no knowledge of the old series or manga*A lot of people when they watch the first episode will probably think this show is sort of silly, kiddish and be put off from watching it right from the start. I know I was.. Had it not been for the people giving it 5 stars I would have never considered pressing on. By episode 5 you should have at least seen enough to be able to make a semi-clear decision on whether this anime is good or not for you. But in my opinion that wouldn't be doing justice for what this show deserves. As of now I am on episode 41 and had just watched episode 1 five days ago. The episodes get super intense and are often always very entertaining. It's been too good for me to take a break from watching. It would be a shame for anyone to pass this up especially if you only watched the first episode. Keep watching and I'm sure most of you who denied it will be easily won over",5
hunter-x-hunter,"This was my favourite anime when growing up, on par with Dragonball. It is one of those animes that you know helped spawnother action, fighting, fantasy and 'powers' in Anime. Nen, was a great instrument to the series and the different variations of it, we can already see this as 'Reiatsu in Bleach', 'Chakra in Naruto' etc. Remember that Hunter X Hunter was before these! The manga was great, but the original did have many fillers in it and some variations were changed that were not in the manga; but this remake is following the original story line which excites me for a few reasons which I will list below.As some of us know, the author suffered from some ailments and stopped the manga near the end of the 'Ant Arc' and the quality was diminishing. The anime also stopped at the end of 'Greed Island' where Gon and Killua were showing that they may have what it takes to rival that of the spiders and other top hunters. I am very happy that this series was picked up, by the original author and the manga was continued in a good quality to a good extent.Also, because the new anime is far behind the manga, there is no need to have long filler arcs which can irritate some people (we all know how Naruto had WHOLE SERIES of fillers which was irritating at times) and it is sticking to the original manga, to the point where the moves, specific frames and even words are being re-used. A great example of this could be seen in the 'Gon Vs Hisoka fight in Celestial Tower', where the new anime follows the manga 'word for word' and 'move for move', where the origianal anime did not, I could use the 'schwing and speech' before they fight as an example of this. Overall this is very promising and with the 'Ant Arc' finished in the Manga, and from the looks of it with another hiauts, another arc is still to come which is could see this new Anime last at least another 4 seasons if not more. This also gives the Author time to let the new Anime catch up to the Manga and not let the new Manga slip in quality.In a world where people shelve television shows on ""cliff-hangers-never-to-be-seen-again"" (which is a huge dissapointment) we can rest assured that this terrific anime has not fallen into this trend and that the author truly wants to finish this in fine form and give his fans the quality that this story has to offer. I highly recommend any anime fan to watch and support this series, if you loved the manga (which was one of Japans best sellers for many, many years) then you will love this anime; no questions asked!",5
hunter-x-hunter,"My friend nagged me for a couple months to watch HxH, and I kept putting it off... Don't do that!!This show is action packed, humorous, and every arc will keep you interested! The characters are diverse and interesting. The plot lines are good and the character development keeps you hooked. Great variety of characters, character skills are original and intriguing. Artwork is fantastic! You won't want to stop watching once you've started!",5
hunter-x-hunter,"Hunter X Hunter is an all around great anime!  It has great action, character development, and it is downright hilarious!  The pacing of this show is perfect and for being a longer series, none of the episodes felt very repetitive. For a long anime, I felt like none of the characters were really forgotten!  They kept popping back up with some sort of development or purpose,  it never felt like they were brought up just to bring back up, it felt like they had a purpose for being brought back. The character development does not feel forced either, the show never makes the viewer feel like they just got a new skill of of the sudden and its going to beat the enemy, it instead shows the viewer that the character has gotten stronger through hard work and perseverance.  The character designs are also very unique to each other and to other animes- the art is fantastic as reflected by the design of the characters.The humor of this show is perfectly melded with the hardcore action and dramatic/traumatic scenes, Hunter x Hunter has a balance like no other!  Each episode has at lease a little of both so the episodes never feel like they are being ruled by one genre.  In addition, the pacing is near perfect!  The series followers the boys over a super long period of time (over a year) and while the pace of time-space is uneven at some points, the pace of the episodes is not.  For example, the Chimera Ants final battle takes over 20 episodes to cover, yet the action is varied and each episode shows a new aspect or viewpoint of the massive and complicated battle taking pace.  I think this great slowing down of the time-space allowed the overall pace of the show to not feel to fast or lacking/hole-y.  And the ending does not disappoint!  Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideWhen Gon finally reached and talked to his dad it was a truly sweet moment and a perfect way to tie up the series!A must watch for all anime fans! - Delaney",5
hunter-x-hunter,"I got into this show a little less than a month ago, but I would watch episodes whenever I could. When the show ended I was absolutely devastated and still am. Usually I lose interest in long animes about 80 episodes (cough cough Shugo Chara cough chough Fairy Tail) but Hunter x Hunter has kept me captivated the whole way through.  There have been times when I've burst into hysteric laughter, been entranced into a battle scene, and couldn't stop crying over what I just watched. Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideThe chimera ant arc has your feels on rampage. The characters are all unique, I enjoyed their individuality. Words cannot express my love for the first ED. All in all, its just a roller coaster of emotions I would ride again. I would recommend this series to just about anyone.",5
hunter-x-hunter,"This is actually the first anime series I've watched. As a life-long (yea, I'm old!) TV addict, starting with the CLASSIC cartoons (Bugs, Daffy, cartoon violence, etc.) when I was 4-5 years old, and as a person who seldom writes reviews, I found myself addicted to Hunter x Hunter as soon as the Hunter Exam started. I ran 135 episodes in less than 2 months. I had to find resolution spots in and / or after each story arc to get my heart rate down! I could write a long essay on character and plot development,the various relationships between characters, the hero's journey, etc. But if you've seen the show, you don't need my input. If you haven't, then watch the show!! If you can handle the violence in context (it's a cartoon!), you'll dig it. The only problem is the series ENDS! Please write to the author and tell him to extend the story!!!",5
hunter-x-hunter,"I think that Hunter x Hunter is the best series that CrunchyRoll has to offer. It has its amazing story, loveable characters, and just the right amount of feel inducing moments to make you want more. I was hooked after the first couple episodes, and for a while Hunter x Hunter made me a shut-in until I was caught up. Well, not like it's any different than how I was or am now. Sadly, there is only one episode left at this moment, and I really wish there was more. But, Hunter x Hunter will always remain in my Top 5 anime of all time. As a person who is a fan of all genres of anime, I highly recommend it to anybody.",5
hunter-x-hunter,"I have been following this anime for more than 5 years beginning with the original 1999 anime, and the remake, which follows the manga more closely, is just as amazing. Hunter x hunter is shounen, but it doesn't focus itself with the overused elements we usually get in this genre about one kid who continuously gets more power, wins every fight, and also has to fight a villain to conclude the story. This anime is more realistic, in such that it's not about good vs evil, everybody can be bad as others can also be the hero. The anime is also very complex and every characters are well-developed. Anyone with an open-mind will definitely love it.",5
hunter-x-hunter,"I am a huge fan of anime and after finishing Naruto Ship.. and Fairy Tail episodes from beginning to most current I needed an anime fix!  I chose a couple I won't name and wasn't interested but then I found Hunter x Hunter.  I was instantly hooked as this show has so much to offer.  Character depth is very important and this show is overflowing with it.  Fans of the world of magic, such as Fairy Tail would find themselves diving straight in to this epic adventure.  The innocent aura of the main character Gon and ""most"" of his pals is equally matched by the horrific darkness surrounding many of the shows villains.  The plot twists and turns elegantly as you follow the characters on their journey.  If you are a fan of action this show hardly lets up accept only when neccesary so the well thought out story may unfold at a most pleasant rate.",5
hunter-x-hunter,"So you may be wondering why you should watch this anime , and also wonder how does this show gets its hype because looking at the cover photo of this show it may look like a stupid kiddy looking anime , but really its an amazing show that not only makes you want more , but keeps you satisfied throughout pretty much the entire thing . In this show characters change , scenarios change , it isn't like other anime where 300 episodes go by and everything is the exact same. This is a role model to other anime and since it is actually a remake , unlike other remakes they actually fix mistakes made in the previous show , exempt this show continues to follow the manga and is still running. Overall this anime is one of the absolute greatest and nails almost anythingThis series is more than a shounen , it is THE  Shounen  to watch",5
hunter-x-hunter,"My all-time favorite series...once you get past the first 2 episodes, you're gonna be hooked. There's barely any series out there that features actual children as protagonists, and this is one of them. And it does it SO WELL. So enjoyable and all the characters are fun to root for, even the evil guys.For those comparing HxH to Naruto or Bleach, please, this manga started BEFORE any of those; so if you notice any similarities, it's not that HxH copied them, but the other way around.Enjoy!",5
hunter-x-hunter,"If you (like myself) thought this shounen anime was strictly for the 12+ age group, then be prepared to rethink that assumption!Awww, just look at the cute & simple looking characters on the cover art....It does begin that way, but progressively builds into something more and more intense, don't get me wrong, its not ALL about fighting, violence, blood, loss, and forboding, it has an uncanny depth of real and relatable emotion.Do yourself a solid and pick this one up!",5
hunter-x-hunter,"I have been using Crunchy Roll for a long time and I never bothered to watch this anime, until a week ago i decided to take a chance on this anime and let me tell you it did not disappoint. This anime is not just a little kids anime but a unexpected adventure for all ages. I know the image looks innocent and cute, but let me tell you is not that ""cute"".Take a chance on this anime, you wont be disappointed.",5
hunter-x-hunter,"Possibly the BEST anime series I've ever seen. And I've seen a lot. From start to where it's at now I've found myself glued to watching it even up to the point where I re watch episodes. Kinda obsessive I know. But you know when there's a new tv series like the vampire diaries or something and you hear everyone addictive to watching it and all obsessive over characters. Well that's me with hunter x hunter. I was gutted the old series got cancelled but then was beyond happy it started again. There are moments where I find the narrator speaks too much but without the narrator the audience would be entirely clueless. The beginning is a little cringy and at times Gon and Killias friendship appears strange but you see the brotherhood between them eventually, otherwise can't flaw it! just wish that more episodes were released and a lot quicker than having to wait!",5
hunter-x-hunter,"Trust me guys this is the anime that you want to see. The last episode was just Amazing and i cant stress enough how much I want to see the next. It is so awesome that it even trumps naruto shippuden and many other animes. This anime has a good story and had movie like animation. By the way the characters have some story very similar to Naruto and I just want to point out the the origins of Hunter x Hunter were released before Naruto so don't assume this copied Naruto because in actuality Naruto Copied This show. Any way Like all great animes like DragonBall Z, One Piece, Naruto, and Fairy Tail, the anime starts of somewhat slow and Childish. For this show it starts of more childish than it does slow. (The pacing of this anime is absolutely perfect, there will never be a time where you want it to be faster or slower trust me). If you continue to watch this show it will increasingly mature in content with gore and dark story at a pretty quick rate. The depth is literally really deep and it can only be appreciated by adults because seriously a child actually wouldn't know how truly perfect the story of this anime is because it requires you to somewhat think about it because it really is that deep of a story. I am asking you guys to at least watch till episode 30 then decide to continue watching.(AND YOU WILL)",5
hunter-x-hunter,"I was so excited when I heard that they were continuing this anime series. I have fond memories watching HxH from when I was 8-9 years old 12-13 years ago. I loved it then and I love it even more now (at 21 years of age). I can't give a detailed analysis of it, but all I know is that after I watch an episode each week, I can hardly wait for the next one. You'll fall in love with all the characters- all so complex and the plot is well-written. It's just EPIC.Highly recommended!",5
hunter-x-hunter,"I've not seen the original but this is one of the few anime's that have inspired me to read the manga and I can honestly say i feel that it is an improvement, filler notwithstanding. However my favourite thing about this is the simple fact that it is what I like to call: ""Dark Shonen"": it has all the action heavy scenes; morally pure protagonists; arcs which don't seem to move the characters any closer to their goals that all major Shonen anime do, but it doesn't make me want to stop watching with just how pointless and childish most shonen seem. It doesn't gloss over the death that should occur around these life and death battles and this does affect Gon's view of the world over time. My favourite anime and beyond compare.",5
hunter-x-hunter,"A GREAT anime in ALL aspects! The action is fast paced and exciting, the story is thrilling and moving, the animation is seamless and proportionally eloquent, the growth of the characters are evenly discovered and built upon, all in all this has become one of my favorite shows. I started watching the original series but the version I had found was dubbed and I couldn’t stand the characters voices. This show keeps me excited for the next episode. I’ve not found many other animes that can keep 90% of the episodes entertaining. With the main plots keeping this series rolling I’ve found that even with what little fillers, if any, stay in line with the original plot and does not seem to bore me in the least. Hope you give this show a watch and stick with it. It truly does become a great show if you can stick through anything you do not seem interested in at w/e point.",5
hunter-x-hunter,"I'm currently watching the older version as well, and WOW I'm impressed with this anime. It's funny, cute, and has excellent fighting scenes. It always keeps me on the edge of my seat waiting to see what happens next! This definitely wasn't a waste of my time. I just can't help but love all of the characters (especially Killua, but you know, back to the main point). I would recommend this to anyone who loves anime c:",5
hunter-x-hunter,"I'm a huge fan of the original Hunter X Hunter series (including the OVA's), and have been waiting a long time for the show to be continued, although a little annoyed that it had to start again from the start rather than being a continuation, there was no way around that.The first 20 or so episodes had me quite skeptical considering that quite a lot had been cut out and yet nothing really had been added. However one of the first things I noticed was that I much preferred the new voice actress who plays the character ""Kurapika"", Miyuki Sawashiro (Whose voice-acting ability has reached God Level), lolWhilst I don't particularly care for updated visuals I do find the art new style works well for most of the story. As for the soundtrack, I think whilst the original show had some really nice tunes, the new soundtrack is much more enjoyable and epic (especially the use of choir in the more recent episodes).It wasn't long before this show got me completely pumped up and then I suddenly realized this is probably one of my favorite shows of all time, or at least somewhere in my top 5. At this point there is no doubt in saying it's the one thing I love looking forward to every week :DThis show does have many of the common themes (or maybe ""overused"") themes found in most typical ""fighting"" shows, such as the theme of ""getting beaten, training to get stronger, etc..etc.. (you know the drill)"" but it does it in a way that makes me feel more engaged and less annoyed then other popular shows like Naruto or Bleach. I think, the themes that this show touches on are handled in such a more genuine and human way that makes me feel like the characters are real (if it weren't for their ridiculously over-the-top inhuman strength).I have incredibly high expectations for this show and just can't friggen wait for the Chimera Ant Arc!!!",5
hunter-x-hunter,I have heard of this series but never before have seen the original anime nor have read the manga. I wasn't too excited at first but I am very happy I stuck with it! The characters are ones you soon start to know and the story is so fascinating and seems like it could go on forever. Because of all of this I decided to start purchasing the manga! This is definitively one of the better shows that I've seen!,5
hunter-x-hunter,"I think their doing an okay job with the remake so far. Its really good for the most part, however I hate how they cut out so much stuff. I was upset when they cut out the scene with Gon and Kaito, I mean it just did a better job of explaining why Gon wants to become a Hunter like his dad. I like all the action in the remake but then I stop and think about the orginal and how much I enjoyed the little side tracked moments that were always for the most part amusing. I will say though that I miss Hisoka's old voice actor, the new guy is good but he's just missing a whimsical quality to him. But then again watching the musical might have made me baised, I mean Hisoka's voice was brillant. My only other compliant was the fact that they skipped the Sushi test of the secound phase. This is supposed to be following the manga more closely but they deviated from it a lot more than the orginal anime. But overall I can't wait for more episodes to come out. If anything hopefully this new series will introduce more people to HunterxHunter and spread the HunterxHunter love =)",5
hunter-x-hunter,"Hunter X Hunter starts off alright.  For most of the first arc, it seems like this well-executed but somewhat generic shonen, one of many.  Little do you realize that this is just the author lulling you into a false sense of security, before yanking you down a twisting, unpredictable, intellectual rabbit hole full of interesting, realistic characters and intense, incredibly variable fights.Regarding interesting characters, HxH has some of the best villains out of any show I've seen.  This isn't just because they're powerful, though they are that.  It's also because they feel like real people.  They have motives, they have friendships, they have likeable quirks, they learn and grow and adapt and become stronger.  In fact, calling them a ""villain"" is really a disservice to the show, they should be called ""antagonists"".  Their position isn't based on some cartoony trope like evil for evil's sake, or power, or most of the typical motives.  It's because they have different values, different perspectives, and that causes them to clash with the main characters and society as a whole.Regarding fights, pretty much every fight in HxH is unique and intense for its own reasons.  There are many reasons for this, but one of the big ones is the power system.  No spoilers, but pretty much any fight can go any way: power levels are explicitly said to be completely irrelevant.  This is because the abilities that the power system allows are incredibly varied, from something as simple as enhanced strength to something as intricate as a bank that gradually charges interest on energy, to something as strange as a vacuum that can suck up any non-living matter.I could go on, but I wont.  Long story short, watch this show, and give it a chance past the first several episodes.  You won't be dissapointed.",5
hunter-x-hunter,"I'd only seen this through some gifsets around the internet, and just started watching because i liked Killua's design, and i'm so glad i did. I loved almost every minute of it, but the biggest draw was definitely the friendship between Killua and Gon. I feel like a lot of things miss out on the simplicity of a solid bond of love (not necessarily romantic),  but from their constant playfulness, training together (and each other), and throughout it all the love was there and its why this show will always be a favourite. The ant arc was really slow though... Luckily the arc after that was really good",5
hunter-x-hunter,"HxH 2011 is my favorite anime of all-time, and for many reasons too.- Favorite Arc of All-time- Gon and Killua are in my top 5 favorite characters of all-time- Best rage moment in all of anime IMO- Best fight of all-time IMO (Not gonna state due to spoilers)- Saddest moment in anime IMOIf you're a fan of Shonen or action/adventure in general give this a shot. It won't let you down.Greatness x Greatness.",5
hunter-x-hunter,"This is a remake of my favorite anime and I've been a fan for almost 2 decades now. The most notable difference this anime has compared to others within its genre is variety. No 2 arcs ever feel the same, nor do they inject themselves with the cliche's found in most other series. ""The more you see, the less you know for sure"" is the case with this series, each arc displaying very diverse themes and tones that range from light to incredibly dark. The majority of the characters are 3 dimensional, having intriguing backgrounds and complex personalities. My favorite character above all else is most definitely KILLUA, but the rest of the cast are great as well. The sound and music was great for the most part. The voices for all the characters were great and fit perfectly as well as their performance, Gon and Killua's actresses especially. The music, while great, felt misused sometimes. There were moments when certain songs were placed that defied the intended mood. The OP never really changes,and while I prefer the original OP, this one's okay. I loved all the EDs, especially the first one.The art style is a breath of fresh air compared to the original. The original art style was much darker while the art style in this series was lighter which also reflected upon the designs of the characters. I for one loved this change considering the focus is mainly on the 2 lead characters : Gon and Killua <3 and the art style heavily complimented the largest aspect of the series, the beautiful friendship between the 2 of them.5/5",5
hunter-x-hunter,"*SIGH* I should be doing homework right now but instead I decided to write a review of this amazing anime!You might think at first, ""Looks like a nice, typical adventure/shounen anime!"" It's not. Yes it is a shounen. Yes it is an adventure anime. But it is in no way a typical one.The story of Hunter x Hunter is a complex one. The main characters train hard using their powers called ""Nen"", they build long lasting friendships, they go through many hardships, but it never ends like you think it would. The main character doesn't suddenly get a powerup when he is losing. The main character doesn't win solely by the power of friendship. And the main character doesn't even face the main villain in the end himself. Sometimes,  nobody wins. The line between good and evil is blurred. It isn't always something simple as ""This is the bad guy. He must lose."" You question your ideals. You question your motivation. Is it truly good? Is the main character truly the hero? Of course, the story isn't always so deep. It certainly doesn't start as deep! It is full of silliness and laughter, filled with lovable characters and upbeat music. I promise you, you will  fall in love with this anime. The animation is beautiful, the music is incomparable to others, and the variety of characters is surprising. You will not get bored.So do yourself a big favor and watch this! You won't regret it. I don't know a single person who has!",5
hunter-x-hunter,"Title says it all really. This show is amazing, all the main characters and a lot of the side characters are really interesting and have cool stories tied to them which makes them very memorable. The ability system is extremely well thought out. Above all else I think my favorite thing about this show is Gon and Killua's friendship, it is great seeing how much those two interact and play off of each other in each episode. It so good that if there were no action packed amazing fight scene (and there are) I would still watch the show if it was just about Gon and Killua running around the country having fun.",5
hunter-x-hunter,"Although you may not understand what you're delving into with the first arch of Hunter x Hunter, it gradually grows into more mature content, and only heads upwards from there, this show does not provide any sort of ""break"" episodes to hype you for the upcoming suspense, it pushes the roller coaster further and further uphill and I have yet to see a point where the action is put aside and something else is put into focus.The characters in this show are very deep and well-designed, there isn't the whole approach of ""this is the bad guy, here's why he's bad, start disliking him"" even the most wanted criminals have a deep history explaining why they are that way.The voice acting is top tier, with great integration into the characters (no one voice stands out as immersion-breaking) they all sound professional and express the mood very well.Animations are high end as well, surprisingly so, since there's a lot of fast pace combat scenes and wonderful displays of color throughout the show.In short: Watch this! It does what it aims to do so well it's a masterpiece.",5
radiant,"The anime is... cute. The protagonist was a little stupid but he was also a super nice kid. Had that, ""Altruistic hero that never gives up!"" vibe going for him. I've seen it before. It didn't give me anything new but hey, I'm here to watch a Shonen anime. I don't have especially high standards when it comes to a series meant for kids. The world is fun the characters are quirky and the plot is simple enough where I can be brain dead and follow along without exerting much effort. It's meh but a good way to pass time. Then I read the manga. Now I won't watch the anime ever again. It's not an honest adaptation whatsoever. Anime and Manga Seth are NOTHING ALIKE. Yes, they have the same character design and the animation IS itself really good... but manga Seth doesn't smile THAT much. He's actually angry a lot, justifiably so. His motives and pain feels more real to me than anime Seth, who felt more like a ""main character"" fill in for a new anime series. As of me writing this, the anime is at it's ninth episode and the manga at it's seventeenth chapter. That is NOT enough space between productions to start an anime and it shows. What I thought was just bland writing was actually FILLER. Black Clover was given ridiculous amounts of hate for their few episodes of filler and the Radiant anime has sooooo much more. Spoilers. Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideChapter six in the manga has our lovable cast all the way over at Rumble Town. Which then follows an amazing, gripping plot that is extremely dark and heartfelt. I was blown away. It deals with heavy-hitting themes like xenophobia, racism, weaponizing and enslaving children. There were also references toward the Salem Witch Trials and The Inquisition. So yeah. I read all seventeen chapters in one sitting and was so devastated with how the beginning of this anime BUTCHERED the beginning of the manga that I refuse to watch anymore of the anime. Episode NINE of the anime finally has Rumble Town REVEALED at least, though they have not yet gone there. Instead the ninth episode was entirely filler to develop Dragunov. Which really doesn't match how Dragunov is portrayed in the manga. I'm assuming of course that he's going to have a character change just like Seth did to make him more generic. Because that's what the anime characters are all written as. Extremely generic tropes meant to draw in viewers. And hey, I'm actually okay with that. You know your audience and you cater to them. Good for you. BUT... the manga is SO MUCH BETTER. Knowing now how amazing, deep, dark, and COMPLEX the manga plot is (after only 17 chapters!), I'm just appalled at how the anime has treated the original work of the author. I could literally go on for pages about the differences but I'm pretty sure there's some sort of limit here. I'll summarize it with this - The anime is painfully ""okay"" to watch. If I didn't know about the manga I'd still be watching it every few weeks when I had a lot of extra free time with nothing else better to do. It's fun. It can get too quirky to the point of not making sense (I'm looking at YOU coffee-loving Octosquid) but it's not bad at all. Just meh. The animation is actually really good and all of the colors are super bright and pretty to look at. Especially with far away shots of landscapes. But the manga... Oh, I've been wanting to get into a new manga for a long time and THIS is it. This is one of my new favorite manga series for a long time. Seth is just so complex and dynamic as a character that I never want to see anime Seth ever again. I feel like the anime took the manga put a ""happy"" filter over it. The manga isn't happy. It has it's moments, of course. Seth is hilarious. There are so many mature and witty gags that I could read this manga forever. The anime is like the ""kid friendly"" version of the manga and gave me bad memories of 4kids back in my childhood. Yeah. I'm making THAT comparison.",3.5
radiant,"No reason to go on and on about this one. Putting it simply; it is a complete bastardization of the manga and is absolutely not worth anyone's time. Read the manga for the good version of this story and of these characters.The anime tells the story poorly; it is mostly filler BS that just makes things drag on entirely more mundanely and boringly than the manga by leaps and bounds. The characters aren't accurate in many cases to the manga versions of them, and arguably the manga's proper versions of their personalities and actions are far more entertaining, engaging, and/or interesting.",1
radiant,"I was a bit excited about this show based on how it started. There's a world with magic, but those who are able to use are seen as monsters, for they survived and encounter with humanity's main nemesis. The protagonist has a very clearly defined goal: to find Radiant, the place where these odd creatures come from, in order to destroy it and prevent nemesis from invading and destroying humankind.Even after seeing first-hand how normal humans mistreat Seth (the protagonist) and Alba (his mentor and mother-figure), we get an even more heart-wrenching moment on the third episode in Alba's flashback as we see young Seth being beaten and almost killed by humans who saw him as a monster simply because he has horns and can do magic. That episode really made me feel for these characters, and it was impressing that Seth was a good person who, despite all that he has suffered at the hands of normal people, still wants to protect them.By contrast, we see in the second episode that there are magicians who do not have the same outlook as Seth and Alba, and who want to take advantage on normal humans, as well as seek revenge. That duality really made the world of Radiant more relatable and interesting.Alas, that is where it all stopped. After the third episode the show took a deep dive into nonsense. Seth meets members of the Inquisition, who appear to be the antagonists who pursue and seek to eliminate sorcerers. ""Why?"" you ask. The so far (episode 6) the show's answer is ""just because."" There isn't a concrete reason for the Inquisition to hunt down sorcerers indiscriminately. It would make sense if they only went after wrong-doers. However, they arrest the naive Seth who could not control his broom and ""crashed"" into the Inquisition's ship. They had arrested Melie (the red-haired witch) because she did not have her documents with her. And I believe they were going to arrest Doc because he was carrying the remainders of a Nemesis.In the first couple of episodes the show clearly sets that sorcerers are the only ones who fight the Nemesis. Not once did the show state that the Inquisition does likewise, only that it is out to get sorcerers for no reason. That is simply not a good way of building up the world. Having a villain with no real motive is boring. Sure, the Nemesis are monsters that destroy everything in their way, but, so far, they seem to be mindless creatures. The Inquisition, however, only seems to be out to get all sorcerers, despite the fact that they are the only ones able to protect humanity from the Nemesis.Also, from the fourth episode forward everyone becomes incredibly one-dimensional and over-the-top idiotic. Those in the Inquisition boat seem incompetent of handling two young magicians and a goofy human. Then they arrive at the flying wizard mecca of Artemis Academy, which Doc forces Seth to become a citizen, knowing fully-well that that will cause Seth to be in enormous debt, which will be transferred to Doc as he had already gone through that process with Melie. Sure, it was very interesting when the cat leader of Artemis brought out the city's defense against the Inquisition, but that's about it. Everything in that town is incredibly goofy for its own sake. Melie, Seth, and Doc all become extravagantly wacky, boisterous, and unbearable to watch.At the end of episode six, Yaga, whom Alma sent Seth to encounter, decides to take Seth as a pupil, for we know that he is special. It seems like the show may or may not get better, but so far it has been incredibly disappointing, especially after such a great set up.TL;DR first three-episodes gave hope of a good series, but the show ultimately falls flat on one-dimensional characters and over-the-top tropes",2
radiant,"This review is after watching ALL of season 1. I wouldn't say this anime is a 10/10 show, especially since the start felt too much like a basic shonen. But... a little further along, it starts to grow on me. I thought it was just going to be one of those 'oh he's op, gonna beat every baddy with the power of desire/motivation blah blah blah' kind of shows... but stuff actually happens and there are actual feels further on in the season/it's not quite so simple. I'm glad I kept up with this show instead of dropping it like originally intended. (btw, notice how like 90% of the people giving the show less than 3 stars are saying the manga is better?.... the show standing alone is decent though.) 'Bout to go read the manga though cuz of those reviews...",3
radiant,"Well first of i was a little skeptical about this and the first few episodes i was starting to give up on the anime but if you grin the first few episodes the anime actually is very much enjoyable the story at first was a bit dragging on my opinion. The main character is funny and he has a very interesting background lots of mysteries about his past, the anime it self is funny and the more episodes you go through the anime is beginning to go even more interesting, the animation is very good and the soundtracks aswell and the story line is super interesting and exicting cant wait to see this animes full potential when people become to realize how good this anime actually is, the anime is like mixing One Piece and Fairy Tail. I very much enjoy this anime and highly reccomend it to anybody else.",4
radiant,"I feel that a lot of people go into rating anime with the wrong expectations, to begin with. You should understand what the anime is meant to be, and if that appealed to you but it failed your expectations, then rate it poorly.In the case of Radiant, I expected a Shonen based on a well-regarded manga, so I know that the story won't quite compare to the original (seriously, shows and movies based on books are seldom as good as the original story). With that said, I've thoroughly enjoyed radiant for what it is: a coming of age story. And for that, this is an excellent shonen anime",5
radiant,Haven't read the manga.Genuinely struggled through the first half of s1 as it got a bit too Sunday morning cartoony for me but it picks up and manages to develop some maturity. Animation is really nice and the main character develops some depth.Lots of mysterious aspects to the plot which leaves you hoping for more!!If you can make it through the mid part of s1 you're in for a good ride! Written after s2 ep4.Hope it helps!,5
radiant,"looks aside this anime is terrible and its a false telling of RADIANT in general the show makes character that where serious sound like fucking idiots and seth in portrayed as a child his voice sounds like that of a child where as in the manga seth is supposed to be a mid teen that has a goofy side of him but he is ultimately goal focused and rather serious, always pushing himself and wanting to do things on his own as much as he can. while in the anime they make it seem like hes hunting nemesis for fun but the also make him doubt himself. ep 2 where he asked the bravery quart for help? while in the manga he tells them to buzz of and that'd he handle it himself. they also had him running around scared of the nemesis which contradicts his personality of wanting to tackle everything head on. IDK when the first volume of this manga came out i was hooked instantly and have kept up to date ever since and when i saw this anime coming out i was so hopeful but not 15 seconds into the first ep things where already different and the useless addition of characters was a pathetic attempt at trying to put more emotion into the ultimate build up for the fight and to be honest i cant get through ep3 i forced myself to watch 1 and 2 and it was beyond corny and character personalities, traits, and voices where nothing like what i had pictured. the black clover adaptation is better than this. when you take something spin it around change everything that people loved about the original you get this a anime that's always going to kill the hopes and faith of the ones that where looking forward to it the most.",4
radiant,"I held off watching this for awhile because of all the negative reviews, and then saw it came out with a second season.  While I have seen a lot of bad shows inexplicably get a season 2, I decided to start watching this show.  The first few episodes got me into the idea of the show...then came a lull, and then holyyy cow did it get badass really really fast.  Give this show some time to warmup, if you are patient it ends up being worth it.  Is it a 10/10?  No, because there is definitely too much filler compared to story arc.  I am hoping the second season will remedy that though!!!",1
radiant,"RADIANT is actually an anime that could have a lot of promise, but seemingly from the first season it hasn't been treated too well. There are a lot of 'Flashback' segments in the early 'training' episodes which pretty well regurgitate content from the past few episodes you would have just watched. The character personas come off as too similar to past anime's (such as Naruto, Fairy Tail, or what not); beyond just being sort of annoying. Probably the worst thing though is that there doesn't feel like there is all that much content in each episode where Seth is in Artemis; in many ways it reminds me of the DBZ half hour of 'screaming' or 'attack being charged' feeling.Going into the second season though, it seems that the anime has improved substantially. It feels like there is actual content to watch here, and some character development has occurred that at least makes it different from other anime. I don't necessarily not recommend this but I do perhaps suggest holding off until it can be determined if season 2 and on makes this anime 'good'.",3
radiant,The anime definitely toned down the source material for a younger audience and even cut out key events that are instrumental to telling the story. It isn't terrible but the manga is quite good and this is mediocre at best. If you enjoyed this even a little do yourself a massive favor and read the manga it is well worth the time. If you hated this the manga still might appeal to you but if you just read the manga and are considering watching the anime just be warned this won't live up to the source material.,4
radiant,"First impression: I'd say that Radiant reminds me of Naruto, except, a little more grounded, perhaps. It is as you'd expect from a character, male, and in his young years and an extrovert attempting to learn magic and become the ultimate hero.More in depth: Personally, the story and ideas seem solid. The intro to the anime kept me interested and the arrange of character seemed interesting. The setting and the world seem well made and thought out; solid and firm. The characters on the other hand are wild and free, amazing details, and vibrant color palette, and an equally exuberant personalities, naturally.The story starts out typically; an quick summary of the world and how it works, switching to the main character running across rooftops, showing off his skills, and ending with a minor baddie showing up and ultimately failing to stop it, to which he is saved; their the first episodes ends.Conclusion: I'd say, this anime has grand potential. However, it keeps to the same introduction, typically male hero character and support groups, and all of it feels the same, just a different world, with different rules. The enemies seem to be the most interesting as little is told about them, they fly through the skies as eggs, and hatch, before causing chaos. Seems there's an arrange of different types of enemies, and if experience tells me anything, each type is going to have its own weakness and strength that the character will have to learn in order to defeat them!",3.5
radiant,"i originally thought this show was going to start out slow then ramp up, similar to how Black Clover began. OH BOY WAS I WRONG. i tried to watch it but it was so painfully average that i had to take breaks with this show, it felt like homework! I am giving it a 3 star rating however as it still had a good premise, but i'm really hoping they improve on the fatal flaws that really make this anime tasteless. It also gave me a hint of other good anime's. It was like there was an aftertaste of a great adventure starting and decent character development, but sadly that was all. This anime is heavily lacking in the good qualities that can really make shows magical.",3.5
radiant,"1 star has been added for not making the protagonist a screaming little boy early on (i'm looking at you Black Clover) 1 star has been added for having a unique take on where sorcerers come from.1 star has been added for having a possible Yandere love interest that will (most likely) become my next waifu.2 stars have been removed for not being all that original in terms of concept.Overall, Radiant could be the underdog this season. It has a lot of potential and I'm a sucker for protagonists with hidden/dormant powers, so hopefully as new episodes come out it'll turn out to be great. For now, it's average but worth keeping an eye on. Would recommend for anyone who enjoy investing early in potential anime hits.",4
radiant,"So far it is enjoyable to watch, but its not the greatest. I don't really care about the MC or any of the side characters, except for Alma. The animation is alright. The sound design is alright. Nothing all to special about this show. Like it would of been interesting to see him get convinced by the old white beard guy and sorta make the MC a anti-hero. But yeah nothing special or new, just another shonen for me to watch to pass the time.",3
radiant,"It's early yet, but it's clearly very similar to Fairy Tail and Black Clover containing elements of both. You have a goody two-shoes meathead protagonist, over the top bad ""normal"" people, and a whole host of things that are somewhat unpolished.That being said, it's not all bad. While the drawing isn't very complex (and it's quite over the top in character designs), it's still decent. The animation is also decent, and there are fights not only against other sorcerers but giant monsters.",3
radiant,"I love Mellie's enormous red hair and split personality.  She would do anything for her friends.  She seems like she gets lonely at times, but she always tries her best.  But Ocoho is so cool.  She rides a dracoon (the cutest portmanteau ever).  And she is written really well.  She's more in charge of her own destiny and often makes decisions that run against what she's supposed to do.  She could easily be the lead character or have her own spin-off.",5
radiant,"It starts out boring and generic, reminded me of Black Clover a little too. Season one is a little bit boring overall expect the last couple of episodes. Season 2 is where it's at. I can strongly say that season 2 is one of my favorite animes to watch this season. it starts out a little slow but the suspense is amazing. I couldn't predict what was going to happen. Don't look at the older reviews, it's only manga fans. As someone that never read the manga, I would definitely watch this anime again. It needs way more starts than it has, underrated anime.",3
radiant,I only watched 8 episodes and got bored. I just keeping waiting for something to happen but it just seem like all I'm getting are fillers to be honest. I was told that the manga is way better but I really don't like reading so here I am. It just feels like D. Gray man rip off but the main character are way more dense and stupid. For any of you guys that already watch the whole does the story picks up or is it this boring and annoying the rest of the way? Don't get me wrong this anime have a lot of potential but they are not doing anything with it.,3
radiant,"I Learned about Radiant through adds on crunchyroll well watching Demon Slayer and thought the add remined me of RWBY back when the show was good but it wasn't enough to get me to watch it. Later I was talking about RWBY, fullmetal and other shows with a friend and he recommended it. So I checked it out and yeah at first is stuck me as enjoyable but kinda dumb fun like Fairy Tail or Naruto. (I later learned this was mostly filler for anime only but to me it didn't really feel too fillery if you get my meaning) Anyway that feeling of a dumb fun lingered for awhile Until Rumble Town. Now I would recommend this show simply do to this Arc alone. You instantly got the feeling that something was off and wow the show got dark quick. at to not spoil anything I'll tell you this. If you like Rwby pre season 4? watch this, you like FMA brotherhood? Watch this. This steampunk fantasy is incredible and I bet it will only continue to get better in it's second season.",3
radiant,"It's entertaining. I see a lot of reviews that compare it to the manga. I didn't read the manga, and I don't think I should either. The thing is, one should judge a show on its own, regardless of the source material. I shouldn't be required to read the manga to judge it. That being said, the animation is spot on, and the plot entertaining. It isn't a masterpiece, nor does it pretend to be. So if you have some time to kill, I recommend a watch.",3
radiant,"I'm going to start this review off by saying that Radiant is possibly one of my favorite Shounens, not just in this last season, but of all time. The Protagonist is as simple and  cliche as they come but that doesn't detriment the rest of the show. The characters are a huge reason why this show is now one of my all time favorites. They all have a variety of different personalities that, on their own might not seem all that special, but when they interact with others or within their little group you feel like there's a special connection between all of them.I feel the need to mention that the animation is constantly average, save for one fight scene in the show that I won't spoil, which actually makes me love this show even more. It's not going to win any awards for animation like UFOtable (RIP) but it's far from the worst.I would have liked to see more of the ""main cast of villains"" which appear sparsely in some episodes lurking in the shadows and behind the scenes of our heroes' many adventures. One character in particular that I would like to focus on is the eye patch wearing inquisitor you see in the cover art for the show. When you watch the opening and he appears you quickly write him off as any other villain, but when you get more into the show you start realizing that this ""villain"" might not actually be that bad of a guy. You feel a sense of empathy for him at times especially during the later stages of the show. Without going into too much detail about the plot of the show he is definitely someone to keep your eye on.I don't want to make this review an entire essay that you would have to read just to know the basic premise of the show, so I'll keep the plot section short and sweet. The plot revolves around a sorcerer in training named Seth and his quest to defeat the hive mind of these monsters called Nemesis. The Nemesis are attracted to overflowing energy that Sorcerers use called Fantasia. Using Fantasia is the only way to stop the nemesis' so the sorcerers don't really have a choice. After realizing that these Nemesis' are never going to stop appearing Seth sets out on a journey to destroy their nest called Radiant. That's pretty much what the show is for the majority of this first season. There are some filler episodes in here but not enough to deter me from watching any further *cough Boruto *cough. In all seriousness Radiant is one of the few new Shounens I have actually taken a liking to with its incredible world and dynamic characters. I just hope they decide sometime in the future to make a season 2.",4
radiant,"This show is good. Interestingly enough, the writer of the manga is French - and if you think about it, there is plenty of European historical inspiration laced throughout the series. The character of ""Seth"" has been changed a little from the manga at least in the beginning, because in the manga he loathes competition and doesn't have as much of a Naruto-esque ""gotta be the best!"" attitude. Overall, if you enjoy shonen anime - I think Radiant is absolutely worth your time. It is much better than the more popular and somewhat similar show ""Black Clover"". While Black Clover is ultimately boiled down to yet ANOTHER ""kid who never gives up"" - Radiant has much deeper philosophical themes, some of which are pretty timely. The show has more of a sense of foreboding and the characters are more complicated. Definitely watch.",5
radiant,anime deals with discrimination but in a good way of as in everyone is egual and its really interesting after the first few episodes. I hope this anime grows more. the thing about writing a review is that you need to apparently need to be detailed and im not really into sharing too much for anyone that wants to read the reviews before watching. all i know is that i like this anime enough to write a small review on it.,3.5
radiant,"A pretty good series so far, at least it is in my opinion. All animes now are pretty much a mashup of previous shows with a slight twist here in there so the creators can ""make  it their own"". Nothing wrong with it either, pretty much everything that can be done in anime has been done. Numerous times. (If I see another d**n anime come out about being reincarnated in another world and the main hero is extremely OP I'm gonna start watching american cartoons again.).......I did abandon my satellite for all Netflix and Crunchyroll anime shows.",3.5
radiant,"Soo... you know how Black Clover was kind of bad at the beginning and became better overtime. Well this show is kind of the opposite in the sense that it's good at the beginning but got a bit mediocre after some episodes. But hey, (That's just a theory a gAmE... ok no) the series is just getting started so I won't judge it, it still has a long way to go, and on it's own the source material in the manga would make for some incredible, even iconic, moments in the anime. Who knows maybe it could be the next big thing.",5
radiant,"This is my personal view of this show, and as someone who is a shonen-trash lover, I can say as far as it goes, this is the best shonen show right now. Blackclover suffers from inconsistent animation and some boring characters. One piece suffers from intense filler and slow pacing, and Boruto is kinda a mess.Now, Radiant, I would say this anime is a delight to watch if you like shonen. It's animated nice, it has fun characters, and it is charming all to watch. While the plot and motivations can be iffy, I wouldn't say its overly distracting. TDLR; Its a fun anime with good animation, that does suffer a little from the generic shonen tropes. If you like those tropes, you'll like this anime.",2
radiant,There is nothing wrong with this anime.  The story line so far has been great.  I believe that people are taking the show out of contents.  Watch it yourself and make your own determinations.  I like it that the main character doesn't allow other people believes interfere with his own beliefs.  I like that he refuses to become the monster that he is believed to be.  He is paving his own path and taking the high road.  It will be interesting to see if he can stay strong and stay the course especially after this last show.,4
radiant,"Let me start off I haven't read the Manga and I am judging on the Anime alone. Just on animation alone this beats out Black Clover but for some reason Cough ""Deep Pockets"" why is that show even getting decent reviews from anyone, yay they made the protagonist stop screaming all the time, tell you what Radiant's protagonist is a trope as we all kind of expected but all yelling is needed when he does. The depth of the characters (probably pulling from the manga) but the expressions and the timing of the reactions (only can get that from the Anime)have great comedic and emotional significance, that makes the story flow and hey when they do a obligatory ""This is what we have been through the past 10 episodes"" it still has a story line comparing it to Naruto is out of line. Just give Radiant a honest look and it will surprise you.",4
radiant,"Some people apparently like stupid main chars, im not one of them.This guy is so thickheaded it ruined the entire show for me.Cant even get my self to finish or even get half way through this serie.So it might just be that i´ve reached a point where id like to see something new but I really dont get any feeling from these people, Can share in their joy, pain, laughs or trials. they just come off as abit shallow and stereotypical, where the writers didnt really care much.",5
radiant,"Okay, nothing too extraordinary about this anime. I think it would be good for kids and teens. I do like that not all the sorcerers are good and enemies are bad. Doc adds some comic relief but he's a bit annoying, just my opinion. I really like Melie though. She's my favorite character. The MC is okay. I like that he is one of those ""never give up"" kinda heroes and I appreciate that he has OP power but it isn't just automatically given to him. He has to work for it and tailor his skills to utilize them properly. I'm curious about the Nemesis and if we will learn more about the intentions behind them. I think I'm 12 episodes in and nothing sketchy or questionable for young kids here. I would like to see more going into character development and storyline. Right now it feels a little too superficial for me (as an adult, anyway). It could add some depth without taking away the lighthearted feel of the show.",5
radiant,"I'll be quick about it (NO SPOILERS):Just another generic shounen anime. Stupid protagonist who wants to change the world and has silly characters as nakama. Protagonist is weak, but has potential (some raw inner strength) and needs to be trained by some cool guy with a real hard training. Just the regular stuff.Thus far, this show doesn't have anything original nor catchy. CONCLUSION: Watch this show if you really, REALLY, love shounen shows (like me).Bonus: Kinda Naruto with magic.",3
radiant,"First off the animation is fantastic, first couple of minutes you can see the quality, and I am liking the story do far. It would be nice to get a anime like this but where the MC is smart and learns powerful moves as the story goes on instead of being an airhead and starting with a lot of power but oh well. I hope this anime lasts awhile, I can see myself watching this for long time if it continues.",5
radiant,"I love the immediate design of Radiant. From its art style to the characters, creatures and the world encompassing them. I've read the one star reviews and how they say this show is too slow, but that's because this series is 21 episodes long, so it has some leeway to take its time in telling its story (in fact S2 is coming with another 21 eps). This show immediately decides to present what kind of world Radiant is, one filled with discrimination. It was interesting to see such a heavy subject matter in a show that I thought was going to be lighthearted. If I had to say one thing about this show, it's that it has heart, you learn about Seth (main character) and the world he lives in and you sympathize with his situation. I want this review to be simple, so all I'll say is watch the first 3 episodes yourself and then form your opinion on the show. Personally I love it, I bought the manga too and I can't wait for more Radiant!",5
radiant,The first few episodes really hold a lot of potential. The fighting expecially with how big just the first fights are gives us a hint of some epic fights to come. The magic is interesting and the story has emotion. I think what will take this from a good to great is some good plot twists revolving around why the eggs are coming and if they are really a bad thing. All in all I cant wait for more.Update - Short of the first few episodes this has really starting falling off pretty hard as nothing even remotely exciting has happened.,5
radiant,"This anime has good potential, im getting a mix of fairy tail and one piece with a little bit of Saturday morning cartoons from this show and since I love both of those shows, im excited to see where this goes. So far is doesn't do anything that hasn't been done before, but it does it really well. I like the art style a lot I can't quite put my finger on it but something about it reminds me of megaman legends. The protagonist is a bit cookie cutter but they also do a good job making him seem more human. As im writing this only three episodes are out right now and the show hasn't quite gotten into full stride but it's getting there.In summary, if you are looking for something that completely redefined the genre then you should look somewhere else, but if you are like me and are looking for the shonen kick then only shows like one piece and fairy tail can satify then you've come to the right place. With a wonderful art style and a great first 3 episodes, this anime has started off strong and I can only see good things up ahead.",3.5
radiant,"Just by the first episode, I can tell this anime is going to be very generic, the power of friendship, believe in yourself. Here are some reasons why.1. Cows somehow have the ability to instantly find out where a massive boulder came from to chase MC. When the boulder flew a great distance. That tells me, anime will have lots of disbelief comedy to try and make things funny.2. MC has the angry stampeding cows chase him into the city. Why the city? Why not run some other direction? But nope he decides to endanger the entire town. Once the cows are tamed, he wonders why everyone is mad at him. Seriously? Another stupid bland MC who has no self-awareness? Instant skip.3. MC cares about people that treat him like a servant/parasite. The anime has not shown why he cares about those people when they treat him terribly. His attitude is ""I must save these people"" as they proceed to be ungrateful telling him to do his job when he owes them nothing. He cares about them just because ""Good Guy"".4. The monsters, look like a mix of a stuffed animal and a Hollow from bleach. This anime has no originality. Looks like a mix of fairy tail and black clover. 5. Bland MC, a copy and past with no original stand out personality. He is boring stale bread.6. The magic looks like someone spilled glitter everywhere and no one felt like cleaning it up.7. Personal grudge, he has only heard stores of these monsters. The thing hatches from an egg, doesn't destroy anything. But the MC first natural instinct is to attack the monster, which makes the monster defend himself and kick the MC's rear end. I get it of the author doesn't want to humanize the monsters, but at least have the MC be curious to see what the monster would do when first being born. To see if the monster, intentionally destroy buildings and kills people or if it does it for self-defense. These are things that make a story unique and interesting. Instead of brand shonen. 8. Just skip the anime, nothing special or original to see here.",3.5
radiant,"This review is for Episode ONE. My opinion can shift over the course of a show, please keep this in mind. (I hope you chose to watch this one)Part of me still wants to change this Star Rating to a 5, but I won't, not yet. This show is everything that Black Clover should have been. It is a somewhat generic seeming Shoenen, with a Naruto-esque protagonist and a complex system of magic. However, there are some key distinctions that I must highlight here as to why I'm really excited to watch more of this show.For starters, the animation and art are very enjoyable, not the best I've seen, but much better than a basic Shoenen normally has.Second, the main character does not appear to have some hidden power that makes him op, he is just a boy learning to be a Sorcerer.Last, but not least, this show is not Japanese. It is French, the anime is a Japanese adaptation of the French source material. And there already seem to be some slight tonal and physical character differences as it relates to gender and age relations, this might make this a good anime to introduce someone to the medium. And, I might be wrong about this one, this is written with just one episode out.Anyway, as a Shoenen fan, I loved it, it really does come from a source of love for the genre and I hope it will continue with the same quality in future episodes.",1
radiant,"I would first like to be by saying that this anime has amazing character designs and a beautiful style. The animation alone made this enjoyable for me to watch and I do not know if it is just my impression but i love the color palette. Now for the actual plot, I felt a little underwhelmed as I did not find anything to capture my attention too much. This anime seems to follow many of the same tropes as other shonen making it feel a little off brandish. But this is the first episode however so we must take time to allow it to grow into its own. I like the main characters voice acting despite initially finding it displeasing as I feel it fits his character. I would also like to say that despite these negatives I feel this will grow to be an amazing anime. This is of course completely subjective and not based off too much evidence. I felt however that the flashback left me with a sense that this could indeed grow to be an anime full of amazing scenes and heartwrenching moments.",5
radiant,"The anime starts very slow, for not to mention it stinks of the stereotypical shonen setting with a young below average smart kid who has an unrealistic goal. I originally watched it because I didn't have anything better to do, but then suddenly after a certain event in the series everything took a turn.The characters, the setting, the feeling.. They are masterfully crafted, I find myself unable to find words to describe it. So in a stereotypical shonen series, whenever something impactful to the story and character happens it's not brushed off like it usually is. Like ""Oh my mother died, well that's ok because I still have the power of friendship and my goal of becoming the [title of the strongest of their kind]!!"" that kind of trope is not here. And I love it. You'd be surprised how realistic the character development and progression feels. It's a vibrant world that the first few episodes just don't do justice for. But from the bottom of my heart I highly reccomend picking this series up, in anime form or in manga!It's absolutely 100% worth it!",4
radiant,So bad i wrote my first review. Watched until episode 10 which had too many flashbacks. It never got any better and felt like it slowed down a lost after 3 or 5 episodes with fillers and events that really meant nothing to the plot or growth just like gegege no kitaro. They didn't even show yaya training. Boring waste of time.  If You want grigimore's and magic you should Watch black clover like people suggest.,5
radiant,"I watched it a bit and it was tedious. The animation was good though. But long story short, I'd rather just watch Black Clover.This anime just felt like they took the basics of black clover, changed up the characters and then just decided to just call it a day. It might be because I've heard this exact story before (because as I said it's just a worse version of BC) so that might be why I find it boring.",4
radiant,"An excellent show that started off a bit slow after the initial arc, but has really hit its stride in the most recent episodes regarding Rumble City. Haven't read the manga, and for all of you ""but the manga was better"" folks, saying that repeatedly honestly makes me want to read it less, and it's probably the same with other folks too. You're just making yourselves look rather silly.As for the show, it starts off relatively light-hearted, and this is where most of the ""just another light-hearted shounen"" reviews are coming from. DO NOT LISTEN TO THEM. After the initial Sorcerer City arc (you'll know what I'm talking about when you get to it), the show starts to get much more nuanced and mature with the Rumble City arc. The other reviews, the ""it's just leftist Trump-hate hurdurdur"" ones... you guys realize that many shows talked about xenophobia, discrimination, and immigration well before Trump took power right? Those aren't new topics.",5
radiant,"...I just saw the poor rating, and decided to not leave it at that.This show, to me, is not bad at all. In fact, it is much fun to watch.The animation is well done; the characters are developing, so far, as does the story.The protagonist has a background which makes his actions credible; he aims high with a strong resolve; and meets companions - now, I am eager to see where the adventurous journey leads to!If you like adventurous anime, such as Black Clover, try this show. It surely is not the most perfectly epic series, which to my mind it does not proclaim to be - to me, it's mostly ""just"" entertaining and sometimes unexpectedly more than that; and most importantly, it has it's own vibe.Tune in and judge for yourself; worth a try, in my humble opinion.",5
radiant,"I tried. I tried because the art was pretty decent and the fight in the first few episodes looked like it may lead to something interesting. I just can't stomach it though. I had to stop half way through Episode 5 in an effort to save my dwindling supply of brain cells which had been culled since the first few moments I decided to try this once more. Maybe this gets good, but I highly doubt it. It is plagued by the worst writing and characters that I've ever witnessed. Why not 1 Star you ask? The art and animations are half way decent. I'll give it a second star because of that. Good bye, horrible anime. May we never meet again.",5
radiant,"Radiant has a slow start, the best episodes come after it has its third. The first three episodes are decidedly bad, and suffer from pacing and writing issues, but the fourth episode is a breath of freshness. Radiant takes that pace and builds on it for a few episodes.But Radiant doesn’t stop there. It shatters expectations once again in the ninth episode. The primary antagonists were given a good deal of depth, and were shown as real people. They weren't ready-bake-bad-guys, but bold men of action bent on saving the many at the cost of a few.All of the poor writing decisions were decidedly refined, the pacing issues outpaced, and Radiant went from being a two star trash heap into a five star shounen anime. Radiant is a lot like a shounen anime protagonist. It starts out weak, but keeps trying harder. Push it down and it gets back up, better than before.",3
radiant,"[Disclaimer: This review was written after watching only the first 3 episodes.]In the first 3 episodes, RADIANT is very similar to Hunter X Hunter. Think about it: a young boy emerges alone in a world of people. He wants to become a hunter. His mother, though at first sad at the news of his departure, learns to accept it and let him go if she truly cares.Now, I'm not saying its exactly the same. The mothers are drastically different, for one. But I do think RADIANT was at least partially inspired by HXH. Why is this not a bad thing? Because it grows off of HXH. From what I've seen, its already begun its course to become something completely different. Yes, it may start off similar, but I'm sure it'll branch off into its own unique, original thing if given time to. Certainly not a favorite of mine, but still a pretty solid anime nonetheless.",4
radiant,"Currently in episode 6 of the series and I enjoy it alot! I personally never watched Naruto or any other big fighting based anime with over a hundred episodes but other reviews point out similarities between them and this anime. Here are my main points:Plot :  Person A is a young boy that wants to achieve a impossible goal that many others have failed to do. Person A doesn't know his true parents as well, and sets off to achieve said goal. People criticise this anime for reusing the same plot as other shonen anime but you can't forget that there is no such thing as ""True Originality"" any more cause everything else has already been done before. It's about how you use that premise to your advantage and make something unique. Animation: The anime itself is quite pretty. I honestly love the colors and visuals and I find myself distracted by the magic being casted ( Ooooh pretty lights ) . I'm removing a star for the most part because in the beginning there was some graphical errors with it. One of the characters, Alma, has only one arm and the other one is cut off. They pointed this out around ep 3 or 4 that this happened a while ago and proving that they know of this (the company). Several scenes show her with both arms are intact and other scenes with the one arm gone. It became a game whenever she is screen to see if she had a missing arm or not.World Building: The concept of this anime is neat to say at the least. Wizards get their magic from being touched ( Bad touch ) by monsters and are outcasted by the towns. Ok, nice concept, but there is some missing info there like, why do they get cursed from the monsters? Open concepts like those are both good and bad for narratives but it doesn't mean that ""magic"" should be the answer for everything. Why is that man a cat? Magic. Why is that man a puppet? Magic. What decides the type of curse people get and how does it relate to being able to control magic? Stop asking stupid questions.Characters: Everyone is a form of a cookie cutter shonen character. Main character that is hyperactive and wants to achieve his dreams. Female supporting character and possible future love interest. Smart(Maybe) pilot that always seems to be the butt of the joke and his forced into the shenanigans of the protag whether he wants to or not. But like I said before, it's how you use that premise and how you spin it. All of the characters have some of their own small unique quirks that helps them differ from other anime (Except the protag. The cookie cutter was not as lenient for him as the others).End Statement:  I'd definitely recommend this if you are waiting for My Hero and love shonen type anime. The visuals are really nice but nothing to build a shrine for like No Game No Life. I'd probably watched this all the way through if the entire series was released if it wasn't simulcast.",3.5
radiant,"It's refreshing to see a world where magic itself has an external societal cost. The idea of cursed power gives sorcerers an ever-present obstacle.The way the villagers see it, the curse associated with surviving a nemesis attack is negatively affects the village as well. Sorcerers become an easy scapegoat for their problems.I think this series is headed in the right direction and I'm enjoying it so far.Edit: After the next couple of episodes didn't do the best with enhancing the plot I've dropped the show and changed my review to a 3.",3.5
radiant,"Let me start by saying that the first couple of episodes of this series are suuuuuper boring. But after that, it actually does start picking up. The story is a pretty typical, but it's not bad. I like the characters well enough, and it has some nice animation. A lot of the reviews I've noticed compare it to Black Clover, and while I haven't seen more than the first 5 minutes of Black Clover on account of the whole ear murder thing, if that's true then maybe I'll be inclined to give it another shot.",5
radiant,"...and I really don't get the complaints. The voice aint disturbing, if you feel that you are both ignorant of the obvious fact the the MC is voiced by a female and are really just looking for stuff to complain about that's not really relevant. You want annoying voice? Try Black Clover until he stopped screaming every 2 minutes...I have watched 3 episodes and find  the show entertaining so far. The feels that hit in the third was genuine and I look forward to see how it goes.Don't listen to the negative comments, watch for yourselves.",5
radiant,"Simply, it's a good show in a overstated market. It has a bit of it's own style, where it's clearly a high fantasy, but dose not beat you over the head with it. It also has an interesting conflict that it shows and explains enough to get the point across, but without being gratuitous with it. Lastly the main charter is a solid young dumb teen boy with a goal of being a ""Nemesis"" Hunter... and that's where the big problem begins.Sadly, this is all something we've seen before, in one form or another, and with anime like Black Clover still running, this dose not stand out enough to keep my full attention. The music is good, but not grate. The characters are good, but not grate. The visuals are good, but not grate. And worst of all for this show, it kept reminding me of other shows.I have no doubt that this will be a good show, I know I'll check out the next few episodes, but I have strong doubts it will rise to the top, after all, it's just going to get compared to shows like Fairy Tail, and Black Clover, two shows that are already established, and ongoing. This show is sadly going to suffer from coming out in a overstated market.",4
keep-your-hands-off-eizouken,"I'm in love with this anime!  When it comes to artwork, and animation, this may be the best example of less is more that I have ever seen.  Simple art.  Simple animation.  Simple design.  And what do you get?  SIMPLY AMAZING !!!   Alongside that, the three main characters are very distinct, very different, and all very interesting.  This anime isn't just about creativity, it stokes the very fires of creation that burn in all of us at some level.    AOTY ?    Oh hell yeah !!!",5
keep-your-hands-off-eizouken,"This isn't your run of the mill story about making anime in a studio. It's three high school girls that embody the animator, director and producer role in anime production. The only thing that holds them back is their creative imagination. Science SARU and director Masaaki Yuasa return after wowing the community with Devilman CRYBABY. The shows aesthetic is gorgeous yet awe-inspiring through its simplicity. You have to appreciate the team by throwing in little hints and bringing their own flair as the animation production studio. I was wondering what the two black links and dot was on the main image. Now I understand.",5
keep-your-hands-off-eizouken,"From the 1st Episode Eizouken is screaming at you, ""Don't think about structure, think about Imagination."" as the real world itself is very tight, and compact. As an example, a doorway has a Air Conditioning unit block half of the top opening, forcing the characters to duck under.The plot itself seems generic, a girl who wants to make artwork but her parents are holding her back for whatever reason. But when you get to the last section, that's when Eizouken shows it's true meaning, ""Imagination.""Your introduced to their inner minds, dreaming of how a drawing becomes a jet that resembles a dragonfly, and watching how their imagination shows it taking off and flying.It's like how kids are at the beach, creating sand castles, then having the ocean rushing in to destroy the castle or roleplaying soldiers raiding it, only in Eizouken you sees that Imagination animated to showcase the creativity.While it's only the first episode I look forward to this journey and the fun that it entails.",5
keep-your-hands-off-eizouken,"This anime has an amazingly good feel to it. It embraces older animation styles and feels like a ghibli movie. The characters feel real and tie together in a wholesome way, the animation is beautiful with incredibly small details that one would overlook, and watching it makes you want to explore whatever world the three main characters have created. And while there is a lot happening at once, it's not to the point where you have no idea what's going on. There's no need for useless explanation because you can understand what's happening, even if you don't really understand it. This is without a doubt the winner of winter 2020.",5
keep-your-hands-off-eizouken,"It's been a while since I've been wowed by an anime. Dynamic creative use of animation, different character designs which are simple yet, or perhaps because of it, expressive. Detailed. yet simple world? Again, making use of what anime is, distilling elements down to poke our imaginations. The world is drawn, but evoking childhood, these worlds you drew are alive in your mind, there's a sequence in this ep that in fact directly addresses this! Fun characters too and fun bits that will bring a chuckle. And if you like meta, this be pretty meta with anime within an anime inspiring an anime character to make an anime with a world based on the school in the anime. My hopes from PVs has been realized so far, hope it keeps up!",5
assassins-pride,"Weird sexualization of children, overpowered, Kirito-like protagonist.I don't know what it is with the anime community that they are into these god-like protagonists who are, at the same time, the most selfless, righteous figures imaginable and then two seconds later are coldblooded, cutthroat badasses. There are no people in the world who can be both, so it comes across as forced and disingenuous. I've watched two episodes and at this point I really don't see what redeeming quality this show has EXCEPT that it isn't Isekai. Just look at the art for the poster, and you got a helpless underage girl dependent on a self insert in his early 20s. You do the math, fill in the blanks.",3
assassins-pride,"*Review as of Episode 1* I randomly came across this manga and fell in love with it so I was stoked to see it was getting an anime adaptation. As of the first episode, however, a few things stood out to me. Please keep in mind that these are all just my observations, being someone who knows where this story goes. First of all, the first episode doesn't do a very good job of world-building. It just kinda throws you into it without a whole lot of explanation. This might flesh out a bit over more episodes but I feel the first episode should at least get the viewer interested in where the story is taking place and what the characters are doing there. Second, there seemed to be quite a few scenes of silence where characters just looked at each other while the camera just cut back and forth. I know this is meant for dramatic effect and is supposed to draw out the nuances of the characters' emotions but I felt it was waaaay too drawn out. Just nitpicking a little bit- nothing too major. And lastly:  Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideI felt the scene where Merida got her mana was rushed and not explained at all. Hopefully in the next episode or so they go into more detail but they portrayed it very poorly here. THAT BEING SAID... This series is going to be one I will be watching every week for sure. I know how good this story is and I think that Merida's character as the underdog who has everything to prove through sheer work and determination is wonderfully shown here and will only get better. Again, don't let these little nitpicks of mine turn you away from this show- it's gonna be a good one.",2
assassins-pride,"I watched the full First Episode: They cut out 80% of the content. I read the Manga, I was excited to share the Anime with my brother who hasn't read the manga. At the 5 minute mark in the anime I had to pause this series to explain what on earth was going on. If I screenshot the 4 random scenes they gave us with no context you'd have as much information about the series as my brother. At the 5 minute mark in the anime as in the manga, you would already know the plot and even the Main Character's personality. They cut plot relevant and character building content, even in the scenes that they showed in the anime they cut content throughout the entire episode. They cut content that would have made transitioning from scene to scene not so confusing as well. Safe to say this episode was extremely disappointing for me, and confusing for my brother. Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideBegining intro of battle scene where someone's dead > Suddenly in a Train for some reason > Now we're at someone's house???? Ah, they drew things nice, but looking nice means nothing if the story is chopped up finer than ground beef. 2 stars because they at least worked on making it look nice and animating.",4
assassins-pride,"Episode one was rough. I enjoyed the badass action but everything else felt way too rushed. Here is a ""short"" summary of what happened: An elite assassin investigating a murder scene leading to a top secret mission to get rid of the daughter of a noble whose dream was to awaken her superpower and join the most prestige Legion in a world haunted by monsters, only to change his mind half way through and instead put his life on the line to help her awaken her inner mana by...kissing? Whoa, slow it down. This is at least two episodes worth of content and I honestly felt too bombarded by information to enjoy much of anything. I can see how manga readers would think this is no big deal, but for someone like myself who had never read any of it, this is a huge issue. Anime is never fun when it's rushed like this. There are other things that bug me aside from the pacing, for example why the heck was she standing on the literal edge of the balcony if she knew she didn't have super powers like the others? And also the whole thing about MC's change of heart leaves so many questions...was MC just like her at one point in his life? Is that how he came to know the method to awaken one's mana that nobody else seems to know? Did he really have to drink the potion then mouth feed it to her in order for this to work?? I don't know. There is just too much going on in this episode and I hope they can pace it out better. For now, this is a solid 3/5 for me.",2
assassins-pride,"Just finished episode 5.Every episode of this terrible show just skips around so much. I haven't even read the manga and I can tell how much is missing. And the worst was Ep 5. It just cut 15 minutes of fighting/story.Fight starts, 15 seconds later it skips to an entirely new location and the fight is ending, with no actual fighting in-between. It just skipped all of the plot relevant fighting. And it did it for 2!! of the fights in this ONE episode. The big plot tournament thing was a single fight that lasted about 30 seconds then turned into a hug-fest.And SO much of the backstory has clearly been missing from every point leading up to this.",2
assassins-pride,"To preface this, I'd never read or even heard of the manga before watching this, so I don't have any preconceptions or expectations, either to be disappointed by or to keep me hopeful for the future of this anime.With that out of the way, I can say that as a new comer every single thing about the first episode other than the art and voice acting was terrible. The main offender was that they gave no context to anything that happens, leaving me not just wondering why something happened but shouting ""WHAT? WHY?! THAT MAKES NO SENSE!"" at the show, multiple times. To give an example:Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideAt the end of the episode, the MC goes out to assassinate the little girl because he had concluded that she's an illegitimate child, and happens upon her being attacked by some monsters. He at first clearly doesn't care (I mean, he was searching for her to kill her anyway, after all) and simply watches dispassionately for a while as she's beaten to death. Then, with no discernible trigger or reason, he suddenly jumps in, saves her, declares her his princess that he would do anything for, and gives her magical powers... by kissing her, a middle school girl. You know, as one does. It would be comical, if it wasn't done in such an overly-dramatized fashion.If that weren't bad enough, the cinematography has absolutely no redeeming qualities. If anything happens that could be construed as significant, the way this anime lets you know is by jumping back and forth between the faces of the characters involved for an excruciatingly long period of time while they do absolutely nothing; the MC catches the little girl as she falls off her balcony? Watch them stare at each other unmoving for a solid 15 seconds, just to make sure you know that it was meaningful. It's like if a soap opera had an illegitimate child with one of those terrible female wish fulfillment shojo animes where all attractive males instantly fall in love with the MC. And like with the plot of this anime itself, that illegitimate child should have been assassinated. When I say ""aggressively terrible"", I really mean it; it's not the sort of thing that's so bad that it's good (to me, anyway), there's nothing funny about the show's failings. It takes itself so seriously and tries so hard that when it fails so spectacularly it's like watching a trainwreck; I legitimately struggled to finish one single episode because it was so painful to watch, and I'll give most anything at least 2 episodes, usually 3. Really the only positive thing I can say about this is that the art is generally good, both in character designs and in animation, so if that's all you care about then I suppose this is fine. If you want literally anything else out of the anime you watch, don't torture yourself by watching this.",1
assassins-pride,"So first eps had some fast pacing which isn't really bad, but sense iv read the manga i figured i know what was glossed over and can keep watching but slowly they butchered this show with giant gaps of information to the point where i realized no one could possibly be following this without manga or LN knowledge ...i liked reading the manga for this show a lot, I actually cared for the characters for their drives and motivations but this anime had become void of anything resembling the story i read, they could still have pulled this anime off if they had just tapered the pacing of  the story but for some reason it needs to go at light speed so you can hardly tell what happened much less follow the plot even if you did read it. all in all this was a mess i give it 1 star i recommend you read it instead D- for execution!",3
assassins-pride,"This show is really uncomfortable to watch. All the girls having skirts that go as far down as their hips aside, It's about a samurai assassin in his late teens falling in love with a 9 year old naive and sheltered child. The premise of the show is actually really interesting. Dude is sent by the nobility to see if shes a basturd child of the father but ends up wanting to save her instead while everyone else around her wants her to fail. Unfortunately, the love story aspect and the outfits are just way too uncomfortable. Ive watched a lot of harem animes in my day that made me cringe but never like this. This show is seriously grose.",1
assassins-pride,"Unless you're a Lolicon there shouldn't be much here you'll enjoy. It's a shame too, because the artistic direction and animation in the very beginning of the 1st episode was great and full of promise--aaaand then our MC meets the loli-bait and the show drops off a cliff. Utter garbage. I've seen just over 300 complete anime series, and this is honestly one of the worst I can remember. It's just a complete waste of some pretty good animation.Apparently an ""assassin's pride"" is grooming a small child.",1

The animation is awesome so ill give it a few more episodes (currently on 2) to see if they can fix this.Why the anime seems to be progressing so fast is beyond my faintest ideal episode 2 feels like any other single seasons episode 10-11.",1
assassins-pride,"I don't know how the series will progress but after episode one it seemed to me like the anime was rushing to tell more of it's source material than it's other versions (LN/Manga). In just one episode they covered up to chapter 5 in the manga, and cut out around 80% of the dialogue which made the show loose quite a bit of nuance and important context. (The MC is a lot more aloof and almost bipolar in the manga, swapping between a joking persona and an unhinged assassin who's stuck in a bad spot, in the anime so far they've shown him as an edgy white knight when his character doesn't usually fit that bill at all.I want this show to succeed because the LN/Manga are a lot of fun and have a lot of potential, however if it doesn't correct course by episode 3 I think I will drop it and just enjoy the story in other forms.",1
assassins-pride,"Assassins Pride has a great story to follow where our protagonist Vampir Kufa learns out about the illegitimate child of the Angel Household. 1st of all the anime compared to the manga felt extremely rushed. If not for the manga I would be completely confused on the key concepts and background information on both Kufa and Melida. This anime's story line on the other hand is magnificent, following Melida's determination to join the Crest Legion and how hardwork should pay off. Overall this anime has a fascinating story to go with, although you are left in the dark about key information that would be beneficial to the character development. Give Assassins Pride a try, but I warn you now if you want a quick show and mindless anime to watch for the season this is the anime for you. On the other hand if you do love the story line like me and want to learn more about the characters go off and read the manga.",3
assassins-pride,"It turns out to be a mediocre show. The MC is under a certain Organization and he's been ordered to investigate the heir of the Main Family by the Head of the Family. If she is to be deemed unworthy, she dies (MC proceeds to assassinating her). However, the MC [an assassin] found something unique about her. He decided to let her live under his supervision with Tutor-Pupil relationship. He then covers up her secret of being an illegitimate heir with his life on the line to protect the pitiful little lady. -Characters. Every single one of them are recycled and clichéd. The MC is interesting to me, at the very least. :D-Fighting scenes. Well, it isn't that good. If you have seen Demon Slayer fights, this is child's play. Boring. Bland. Watch it and you will see a big difference.-Animation, Art, music, bgm, and sound effects are good. In fact, pretty darn good.TL,DR: Overall, 6/10 for the anime. The characters are not really all that interesting. The age is also quite a factor. I am not comfortable watching 11 year old kids trying to beat each other to please the adults. Also seriously, all of them are girls. Really? He's supposed to be a teacher/tutor but, he barely taught her anything. Other than supervising a practice match. Teacher my ass. The Manga is well developed while the anime is rushed. I'd rate the manga 8/10.",3
assassins-pride,"This anime seems to be a patch job of tropes that are poorly stitched together. There are many important things they don't even show happening / skip over. It feels like watching a show with someone who every 5 seconds is pressing 'skip' or 'fast-forward' on the remote.Example (very minor spoilers): one second there's an event that's a week away that they're going to train for; then, the next second the even is happening. There's no training montage, no cut to morning of where character's waking up, just boom now we're at the event.Some of the characters seem a bit flimsy. Though this could just be due to the previous point. Example (no spoilers): in the course of like 30 seconds, one character goes from ""I cannot accept this person, it goes against who I am"" to ""I must see their dream come true and dedicate my life to them"". I feel like it could have been decent or good, maybe even great; but with the atrocious story progression and flimsy character tropes, it is a terribly executed anime.",1
assassins-pride,"I've never seen so many overused themes and characters in my life. If there is a common trope, this series has it. None of this is spoilery, because I promise you that you've seen it all before. A dark-haired edgey boi that is apathetic and calculating, but gets somehow instantly attached to the blonde loli that needs protecting at all costs! She shows him an accidental panty shot and falls off a balcony into his arms in the first ep. Aww, isn't she just so sweet and clumsy, and does her best! Goes right into a stereotypical tournament arc right after. Bleh... Avoid it at all costs.",1
assassins-pride,"bland characters, forced conflicts, absolutely no character development, the script forcibly attempts to evoke emotion from me by causing conflict but ive known the characters for less than 1-2 episodes so why the hell would i care?? bro im BEGGING YOU, PLEASE JUST PACE THIS AND DEVELOP CHARACTERSalso the general idea and concept is overplayed and boring and every single female character in this show made me so angry its just not funny.",1
assassins-pride,"The pacing is awful, there is no such thing as character development, or any substantial world building. Just a bunch of cliche shoujo lines thrown together by one of those AI's that can write terrible ""stories"" if you give them a topic. Even the parts that are supposed to be satisfying just feel wrong because you don't even understand how they got to this point. Main character is supposed to be a heartless assassin but then he just submits himself to helping her for no reason that has no explanation making it feel so out character and just wrong. Don't watch.",2
assassins-pride,Tldr: don't watch. other animes do the brooding character theme better.As far as the first episode goes. It's pretty dang boring. From characters to scene presentation.Starts off with an action scene that is over and done in roughly thirty seconds to try to captivate you. Then it decides it's a great time to just lore dump all over you. I'm more of a show dont tell kind of guy. Also the MCs goals are all over the place so I'm not really sure what's going on. As far as art goes. Its decent. Nothing amazing. Although the MC looks like hes had a stroke at some point in his life.One last tidbit. I'm not sure if the author understands what the word lycanthope means as in the anime it just seems to mean monsters in general. Maybe there's werewolves later but all we really got were dudes with pumpkin heads.,3
assassins-pride,"As of Episode 1...Theres a few hiccups in the first episode where it seems a bit generic or flat, or maybe its just that the anime has difficulty portraying the scene and feelings of what was intended in mangas and light novels. However, the art is good, the story line and situation being seen thus far seems quite different and interesting. As of episode 1, few minor complaints include the opening scene, no one shoots a gun like that in that situation nor do they act calmly to a man cutting bullets with a sword slicing up dudes next to him. Second, at 1450 he uses a tool to jump higher, but immediately after just straight up jumps higher without it or it being visually seen...If you can jump that high, why do you even need a tool. Anyways, Im sure it'll be more useful later or reasons we have yet to be unveiled but looking forward to this and a few other animes these coming weeks.Episode 2Cliche fight against bullies in tournament, bully becomes friend, etc. Im glad they skipped the unnecessary training montage but they hardly had a chance to give proper backstory to these things. Not a bad episode, does alright, seems like a show full of Size A Lolis fighting each other clad in various colors. Still not a lot of backstory on the whole world building and such but I'll continue watching. Its a good show as a time killer but not a super special one. I will say the art is very colorful and the art is pretty well done. Above average against all the other animes that have been being released lately, so its a slight change in that aspect.So Ive been watching every week since the first episode, while episode 1 showed some promise and interesting world building and such, it was never touched in exchange to rush the story. Coming to episode 6 which is completely fan service filler and also completely pointless They hardly speak about any of the things outside of the school which is cringing because its all Lolis and cats from their uniforms to the hoodie night gowns in trash (episode) 6. Im sure the manga is better but from what I can tell, not by much. Theres so much content not given and its almost entirely focused on little girls theres hardly anything worth making it to watch now. I was interested to see why the whole city is transported by train in a giant chandelier, I was interested to see what social class system this had, wondering why theres so much prejudice with non mana users or even wtf mana is, why theres lycanthropes, or vampires and lycans are compared, or even what is this land of eternal night they occasionally go on about. This show could have gone better and had all the right elements to do it, but they didnt, they just rushed the first few episodes and seemingly ditched any good stuff and then they give us a filler episode...what the actual F are they doing? I watched because i figured theres much more story if they're rushing this much, but this show has lost all my interest and what little respect I had for it left over. Most trash shows kinda make me want to read the manga and see otherwise, but this is not the case here, I can't do this to myself anymore, This is dropped, no disrespect to anyone who likes it, but for the majority, just skipTL;DR If you like cats and lolis, sure watch it if you have ABSOLUTELY NOTHING BETTER TO DO. Otherwise, skip, its not even worth your free time and both story and presentation is atrocious.",3
assassins-pride,"I have not read the LNs but do plan to because one of the positives of this show has been the interesting world they built for the characters to inhabit.  A 22 to 25 episode run would have done the property justice and let us get to know some of the supporting characters better and helped with some of the pacing problems but we get what looked like three novels from the series crammed into 12 episodes.  I get that the payoff we want from a finale is the end of the third book but that is asking too much; four episode per novel is about 80 minutes of run time each and I've yet to see a 90 minute movie do a novel justice so the producers and show runners were setting this up to fail (I understand it doesn't line up with your 13 week seasons but that means you world build and tell only the first story or have a little faith in the IP and pony up the extra season before getting a chance to see how market takes to the show).  A general understanding of honorifics (and the meaning behind their use or absence) always helps when trying to unravel some of the relationships and there is some lazy subtitling that could rub viewers the wrong way (and localizing a sub can be a thankless job but when a concept behind a name is so important to understanding a character I need you to try a little harder than the literal translation in quotes).  Goods:  Interesting world/setting, action bits are well animated, OP is very catchy. Others:  Pacing is all over the place, characters end up with half explained motivations that don't always match the choices they're making, the age difference will add a layer to the MCs relationship that some will find hard to feel good about (I don't think Kufa feels a romantic love for Melida but some audiences aren't going to like the bond they share or understand how it isn't romantic).  Overall give it a try if you're looking for a fantasy that might be a little off the beaten path but twelve episodes goes by quick and will leave you with some questions (which based on the LNs success I assume are answered in that medium if you're willing to pick up a book and read).  Three and a half stars if I could give out halves.",1
assassins-pride,"The opening episodes show a desolate world where the last of humanity struggle in the lantern city, then as soon as the show puts focus on the the two main characters relationship everything about the city and background was just forgotten. Next, They bring up lancathropes as the main enemy to humans but shortly forgotten and only used to describe the main characters ""dark side"" which why is he a vampire with no backstory. Let's not forget about this late 20's government official assassin vampire has legit touched every part of the 12 year old girl promoting pedo activity then end with nothing about vampires, the lancathropes the lantern city the world the state of humanity the relationship no all of this random shit to tell us he takes pride in his student, show has no baseline no plot no consistency its shit",3
assassins-pride,"The premise of an assassin and a somewhat neglected noble daughter teaming up together is quite an interesting one. The ideas for this show are, in my own humble opinion, very intriguing and quite sophisticated for what you would call a ""typical"" magic girl series. I highlight the typical part because it is actually not that typical, making this show something that had me quite excited when I started it.The show's setting makes for a very gritty approach, so I felt that some of the inclusions such as the infamous ""girl gets jealous and grabs breast of another girl"" scenes were out of place in this anime, despite the cute moments that were definitely there.For anyone thinking about this anime: do give it a go. The story and setting is ingenious enough to get one warm for a nice show and I did feel like it was one, up untill episode 8-9.To expand on this: (this part will have light spoilers)I felt like the story in the first few episodes, right untill the end of the ""tournament arch"" couldve made a good season by itself. by expanding the details and becoming attached to the progress of this MC package, as well as adding a little bit of backstory.the ""village arch"" right afterwards was an arch that i felt couldve even be included in that season possibly. a great story where you could really get to the heart of characters other than the MC package and with a bit more actual showing of the scheming behind the scenes etc it couldve been amazing. to be completely honest the last ""arch"" was a complete mess of things and felt so out of place that my heart completely lost the feel of the world I was sensing before. i cant help but feel like if they had taken an approach to this anime similar to the anime ""overlord"", it could have been so much better. for example, imagine a bit more care for just the tournament and village parts in the first season and then slamming people with a second season all about doing whatever the third part was supposed to be right, showing the story from multiple sides and really getting in tune with the surroundings of the world. if they had done that, maybe in next years winter collection, I feel like it could have been a lot easier to process. such a shame, but nonetheless I did enjoy the first 2 parts of the show for what they were.",1
assassins-pride,"*edit* after watching the last couple of episodes it's been lack luster. still an interesting story but the pacing of the show is really off, and has been off since the beginning I've retracted a star. **It's certainly a flawed show, but a lot of the things about the show that are good often are missed. I believe the primary flaw is the title. It seems that the developers wanted to have a cool English name which appeals to the Japanese but because the Title doesn't give due justice to what the show is about it falls short for most American viewers expectations. It is definitely a ""vampire romance story""(twilighters delight) with action and magical girls. and the story is not fantastic or well paced. HOWEVER, The animation/visuals, the music, and the sound are some of the most well done I think I've found in an anime to date. whoever mastered their audio I want to shake their hand. voices give proper reverb based on location, the exact expected footstep sounds added in for location, and so much more blew me away. additionally I don't know of an OP/ED I've enjoyed more in the last year or so. I've watched it every time so far (especially the ending credits; the vocals are F****** ON POINT, absolutely beautiful). Also, the colors and visual art style is superb. Honestly I believe if the title were different then it may have attracted a different audience and wouldn't have had such harsh reviews. It's definitely a beautiful and well done show. Hell, even the world it's based in is interesting if you pay attention to subtleties. The story is simply lacking luster, partially due to expectations. If you want to watch it. don't go into the show expecting a very dark menacing show, expect an action-drama-romance. You'll likely enjoy it more that way. Thanks for reading!",1
assassins-pride,"Pros: This anime is something that I personally believe anyone could sit down and watch all the way through. The soundtrack for this series is amazing, and the animation style is bearable (barring a few select scenes). The characters (for the most part) aren't completely fluff and have some backstory and development as the anime progresses. The anime comes from a strong pedigree of light novel volumes and a good manga (meaning anything you can't understand in the show, or want to know more of can be further researched in the other mediums.) Cons:There is a lot that the producers left out in terms of core lore and content. It is unsure if this was the way that the production team intended the anime to come out (due to budget or otherwise), however, from my perspective this anime will likely fall short of anything but a brief and unmemorable seasonal anime.",3
assassins-pride,"Everything in this, from the dialogue to the basic setting, reads like a parody of trash anime. The characters don't act like people, the writing is atrocious, and it takes every creepy anime trope and dumb powerfantasy idea and dials them up to eleven.This would all be fine if that was the intention. Instead we have an anime so bad and absurd that it should be funny, but instead it's just sad how bad it is.",3
assassins-pride,"you know i tend to watch one trashy anime per season just to keep my senses fresh for when i go to watch and judge other more well known titles, and for starters this one looked cool from the cover art and the first three episodes where good on a level of average nothing crazy although ep 3 was hype af and the sound tracks are actually awesome, animation solid and quite pleasing to look at the highlighted characters when using mana has a really cool effect.which then brings me to the biggest problem.... the direction, plot, and tone...its EVERYWHERE after 9! ep i can tell you little to nothing about this show not because they don't tell you because they place it right in front of you, say ""here"" and then almost as soon as you pick it up they are on something completely different... there is ABSOLUTELY no emotional connections with this. As a casual viewer of this show i feel nothing about when people in it get hurt upset happy mad... i mean its just empty, combine that with a plot that rushing faster than Usain Bolt its almost like it doesn't want you to enjoy what it's presenting... it might as well be a slide show passing through key frames. Lastly i hope this doesn't go the UQ Holder route where the first like 3-4 ep where it is really good pacing and has awesome action and then it just does a complete 180 to rush everything and focuses on nothing but alive and ghost harem and goes full moe trash.... now the action doesn't have to be demon slayer levels but it is important when making a action anime to include actual fighting... and to keep viewers in you need to at least keep a pace and give us time to get invested rather than just assume we are.would give one stars but ost and animation keeps it at 2",1
assassins-pride,"I will say the only reason I watched up until episode 9 was one, opening is good and two Rosetti. Literally watched the most recent episodes because I really wanted to give it a shot, first episode not that great, but I was like hey it probably gets better. Fights could be better and longer, but hey it gets better right? But you get to episode 9 and you are like really? They are really over forcing them together. I just can't stand it. Its so cringe. Could have had something good with someone else, but no lets have the 18 year old dude go for the 12 year old. No thanks. I really don't know how this could get over 3 stars. It's a hard pass for me. Not worth a watch anymore.",1
assassins-pride,"I've never read the manga and as such can't be disappointed by things being cut, like a lot of reviews I've read. The story is fantastic, the character building not so much. You get a lot of details about one or two characters and not so much about the others who seem important to the story line. Now that may change in future episodes and I do hope so. It's definitely worth a watch of you're into action anime.",1
assassins-pride,"I have not read the source manga, and the first episode makes me not want to continue the show.Most of the story in the first episode is told through bland exposition dumps. The episode is extremely front-loaded with concepts, plot details and characters that have no relevance to the episode itself. It's all told through stilted dialogue, and the melodramatic dialogue has some real corny bangers.The main character, Kufa Vampir, is presented as a brooding, cool, dark-haired gentleman overpowered hero that we see too often these days. There will be Kirito comparisons. The first episode gives the sense that the hero will do all the saving and the girls only exist to be saved. I don't know if this will end up being subverted later, but it's what the first episode hinted toward.The world looks interesting, but all the background artwork is static and flat. It appears the budget was blown on the early fight scene, because every other shot afterward has off-model drawings. There's an animation of Kufa's feet like 12-inches apart as he walks away from the camera, and all I can think is, ""that's not how legs work.""Character designs are pretty bland: Innocent long-haired blonde, bold and fiery red-head, stoic girl with short silver hair, haughty twin-drill princess, etc. You've seen them all already. I didn't see anything this episode that made me want to continue.",1
assassins-pride,"I haven't read the manga, so I have no idea how the story will progress, but I like what I see so far after viewing the 1st episode. The opening scene had a very ""Sword Art Online"" feel to it, and definitely sparked my interest to continue watching. I think this first episode was quite well done, decent artwork, and interesting concept for the begining of the story arc. I look forward to seeing how the characters of of Kufa and  Melida develop, along with a couple of other characters that were introduced earlier in the episode (which I have no doubt earmarks their return at a later stage).Overall,  I enjoyed this first episode and I hope they keep up the good work in the subsequent ones.",1
assassins-pride,"This feels like a true wrap-up of the 2010's. The final bow out of what too many shows in this decade were, short-handed, quickly put together, commercials for LN sales. We've all been victim to it, something promising, a cool design, an intriguing story, or likable characters. But, it always ends up the same, a letdown of a 12 episode season that is best described as ""just good enough"". The concept of Assassins Pride was fascinating to me, but a lack of effort from the animation department (and likely due to budget issues) turns this potentially hot series into another forgettable seasonal flop. With the right animation and time this could have been something much better than it was.",2
assassins-pride,"Assassin's Pride actually has a lot of good things going for it.  The OP has some nice animation and it's timed to match the beats in the music to the beats in animation.  The animation starts out pretty decent (though it suffers as the series progresses).  The world-building is very cool!  Most of the characters are kind of interesting.  But the main character, Kufu Vampyr turns this show into a dumpster fire.  His main purpose is to be a power/chivalry fantasy stand-in for the target audience.  Almost everything he does and says is pure cringe.  It's fantastic!  I kept thinking about how much better it would be if he just wasn't in the show.  The story could be reworked in minor ways to remove him.I see a lot of complaints about this show being pedo-bait, but if I'm being honest, Kufu is probably like 15, and the girls are 13.  Also, why does this show get trashed, but Shield Hero is beloved?  I don't have a good answer for that.",5
assassins-pride,"There is a lot of plot missing in the anime. The character starts off super weak then all of a sudden is super strong with this training she never shuts up about that we see none of. A lot of times there's no build up to something and it happens out of nowhere with little to no explanation of how it came to be, or the explanation is super rushed. And all the  Children that should be seen as  children",1
assassins-pride,"Well how can we talk about Assassins Pride ? This is the kinda of anime that moves too much fast, in the way that you cannot understand. People are watching this just because of him, to try to understand his history and how he get's there, but still the way that the history goes are really trash. I'm keep seeing because i like the style but it's not good if you wanna risk take you chance but just if you like the style.",3
assassins-pride,"the first 3 episodes of this anime were not horrible. The show showed some promise here and there, and the animation, as well as story, were not the worst i have ever seen at all. The real issue came after these first episodes and it just went from a loose 6/10 for me to a shaky 4/10 by the end of it. The animation quality getting worse and worse, reaching a really low level, especially in the last episode, but also just the story becoming incoherent, nonsensical, as well as simply dumbfounding. It is a shame since i kind of like the concept and all of this show, but how they chose to execute it in this anime is riddled with flaws to say the least. The pacing and skipping in this anime is also one of its major flaws.This is one of the few animes i've watched this year where i would just simply recommend you to not watch it, no matter your likes or preferences. It is just so lacking, that is all.",1
assassins-pride,"Continuing the trend of ""Whatever anime Crunchyroll recommends to me via ads will be terrible,"" I am greeted with an interesting concept that consistently fails in execution. I don't know if they're rushing to finish up a certain amount of the source material or what, but it's incredibly obvious that this show doesn't care about explaining things to the viewer and would rather someone give a one-line explanation in the middle of a fight instead of actually build up to things.They tell the audience that the MC is going to be training the heroine for a week, but they skip all of that time to get straight to the tournament so they can avoid building up any dramatic tension. Then after the big reveal of her skills, she gets in a bad situation so that the writers can flashback to show her training on her own as an attempt to explain why she was able to do a move that even her instructor was surprised by (even though the training showed her practicing it in a different way than was actually pulled off in the fight).They neglect to tell the audience anything about classes when they are obviously a big deal. Different classes have different mana, obviously, but apparently it makes it so that they are only able to wield one type of weapon. This means that the MCs plan to hide the heroine's class is basically impossible from the get-go since he gives her a samurai blade instead of trying to make her use samurai moves with a paladin sword or something. But then the show introduces a class that can copy other classes and we're supposed to act like this is a big surprise even though we know nothing about what a class means at this point. As a matter of fact, that scene tells us more about the Clown class than we've ever learned about Samurai, Paladin, or anyone else we've seen. Not only that, but the writers then assume the audience knows that this Clown class can also perfectly disguise themselves as someone else even though that has nothing to do with using weapons from all the basic classes.Even when the show isn't throwing bad world-building at you, you will still be stuck with confusing character moments. We know nothing about the samurai class except that it seems to be good at battou drawing techniques and phantom weaponry made out of raw aura, but the MC is weirdly able to perform perfect combo moves with people he's never met before and they just gloss over it. Nobody questions it either since I guess we're supposed to have forgotten about it because of the big reveal that happened in the next fight in the museum...wait, why was the MC fighting solo in that next fight anyway? His ally was clearly unharmed since they pulled off that perfect assault, but they don't even give a brief ""I'm going to go check for enemies this way"" line to explain why they split up.I think the biggest punch in the gut though is that even though it feels like they are cutting out all of this worldbuilding to just give us spectacle, they skimp out on the spectacle too. Someone infiltrates a match in a sealed room in order to kill the contestants, the targets barely manage to get to the door at which point the assassin destroys the lock. Suddenly, the MC appears through the unlocked door! (couldn't he have just opened it himself since he has a more powerful class than the assassin?) Time to see the protagonist utterly wipe the floor with this foolish assassin who made him mad! This is going to be awesome! WHAT DO YOU MEAN THE SCENE INSTANTLY CUTS TO A SHOT OF THE ASSASSIN KNOCKED ON THE GROUND A MILE OUTSIDE OF THE TOURNAMENT GROUNDS STRIPPED OF ALL HER WEAPONS!? They literally skipped over the ENTIRE fight!I wanted to like this one. I really did. But it's quite clear to me that either the source material had a terrible writer, or the people who adapted it into an anime simply had zero respect for anything the original did. I may end up looking into the original source material, but right now my expectations have been so betrayed that I don't think I want anything to do with this series right now.",3
assassins-pride,"When you are writing a story that takes place in an entirely fictional world, that world requires a degree of explanation. Assassins Pride totally lacks that. This show is overflowing with the fantasy version of ""technobabble"" that we have no real context of. We are only ever given the vaguest explanations of things are are key points of the show - like why it is so important that the main heroine is or is not the daughter of the duke. We don't know what the monsters are or what threat they pose. We don't know that these people are the ruling class because we never see anyone outside of that class. We don't know what the rules are for mana and how it's apparently different from magic.There's far too much missing context!The age of the girls in this show is also very unclear as is the age of the ""assassin"" and the other teacher. No one looks like they are the age they are claimed to be. I feel like the groundwork is here for a really really cool story and world and characters. But so much detail is missing that we really are left just filling in the blanks ourselves and trying to guess why such and such is important, if at all. On the positive side though, the opening theme is great!Pros:Good musicCool ideas and conceptsCons:Unforgivably bad world buildingBad pacingPlot hole city",3
assassins-pride,"I just watched this entire anime in one day, and I've already forgotten the majority that happened. Now, keep in mind I have only watched the anime, I have no other exposure to this. To me, the plot is essentially an assassin is supposed to get close to a girl, decides to kill her after spending an hour with her. He sees her getting beat up by a gang of pumpkins, pops a boner, then decides to completely forget being an assassin for the chance to have sex with her. As for the three stars, all I can say is that this anime is incredibly average. The OP is a banger, the art style is interesting, but the story is boring and has so many plot holes that I thought I was driving over swiss cheese. Much of what happens is forgettable. If you are looking for something to kill six hours with, then choose this anime. Its fun, just proceed to question your morals at the end after watching a grown man flirt with a 10-year-old for twelve episodes (surprise incest included).",2

assassins-pride,"After watching the anime as a whole, at times I find myself forgetting the main story, with so many story arcs covered in such a short amount of time confuses me as to what the point is. Speaking of time, the story paced itself quite poorly with covering i assume a single year within 12 episodes, not to mention there is a filler in a 12 episode season! Some story arcs were interesting but I was more invested in the main story and they only really covered it in a few episodes. With many time jumps out of nowhere by episode 12 the once ""incompetent talented girl"" is now able to fight along her half-human half-vampire lancanthrope (the strongest lancanthrope class) sensei against some guy that only ever had 3 appearances. There isn't even a consistent antagonist that lasts for 3 episodes.This anime should've been at least 24 episodes, if you don't want to show backstory for the other characters thats fine but the main characters only got like 30m worth of time to explain their origin. The art was fine till halfway, then the quality dropped from better than good to rushed works.Also saying ""Milady"" (Ojō-sama) is really weird and creeps me out, and i don't think it's just meWhat this anime need is more detail and more episodes.Heres a video on it: https://youtu.be/-EbH6DYnvaM",4
assassins-pride,"Yeah, it may not hold up to most anime, pacing could be better and more could be explained. Though the slow pacing and quality dipped for me here and there, It kept me wanting more regardless. It starts off with a bang and ends quite nicely leaving a good entry for a second season if it gets one.  I can see why this wouldn't be for everyone, but honestly I think people nit pick a lot of things these days and it ends up ruining a lot of decent anime and leaving them to roam only with one season. If you can just relax and enjoy whats there I think most people would rather enjoy more and more. Shows would get more into something great, sometimes they just don't get the chance to find their footing in the first season and possibly could be incredible in the second. Usually just do to people being not found of what they are doing.",1
assassins-pride,"Their was obviously budget issues but it was a decent watch.Lot of you watched it and just complained, but why watch it which supports it?I thought it was pretty good, in no way does that mean its perfect, or a must watch. Just, pretty good. I liked the characters, the color choices were pretty and the plot was pretty nice. Sure maybe sometimes cliche, or to those who didn't as  ALWAYS read the manga, is confusing. Overall 4/5 season 2 pls",2
assassins-pride,"I actually enjoyed this anime, even with its peculiarities. The art is amazing and the music is really nice on the ears. The premise is interesting and the plot reminds me of a Brazilian soap opera. I need a season 2 of this mess ASAP!The final episodes are somewhat too fast-paced but in the end almost everything ties together, with the exception of some open ends for season 2.Overall I'd give this an 8.5/10",1
assassins-pride,"With the bad story writing, and boring world building, the only thing it has to fall back on is the depth of the characters. But that's not very good either, the characters are one dimensional and boring. They have no growth either, each one of them is the same from start to finish. Its not that this is the worst anime or anything, it just has nothing good about it. Except maybe the opening song, its pretty catchy.",5
assassins-pride,"I saw an ad for this show on youtube, and I was looking for a new anime to watch. The first episode intrigued me, but I was very confused. I looked up the manga, which helped me to understand a lot more. I agree with many other reviews that the manga goes into more depth with character and world development, which does help make for a more cohesive anime show, BUT I still like the show! I have to say that this anime is very ""forward"" with the sexual nuances, but it doesn't really bother me (does that make me a perv??? lol). I'm hoping that with future episodes it will show more character development and not skim over some key details (The manga really does have a lot of stuff that isn't covered in the anime), because that will make for a better anime show!",2
assassins-pride,I'm an anime-only watcher and have seen the numerous comments about how the pacing is terrible and doesn't really line up with the manga. I will agree that there are some rough spots and it can be very cliche but I like the MC and find the setting interesting. It does have a lot of wasted potential but I still found myself watching every episode and wondering how it will end. The animation is not the best but it isn't bad and the opening is very catchy and I never skip it. The relationship between the two characters can be kinda cringe because of their age but if you try not to think about it and think about the setting of the story and how they see age you'll be able to get through it.,5
assassins-pride,"First, Pretty decent OPSecond, gorgeous atmosphere and settingThird, the animation is inconsistently great or terrible but the art is usually on pointbut.... WTFlike, its watchable enough that, well, i watched it but it has some serious issues... some of which may be its saving grace?Honestly nothing I can say about this show really covers it.  Its like a crazy fan fic that kept getting close to cool ideas and decided to immediately turn 90 degrees every time it happened.  One character uses magic fire for fricking subtitles and instead of making that an interesting bit of representation for a deaf or mute character, she just turned out to be doing it to be edgy...and that's before we cover the creepy pedo vibe the main... ""couple"" gives off.Should you watch the show?absolutelylook up Mother's Basement's roast of it and you'll understand why.",3
assassins-pride,"When I saw this series, I was rather hyped for it. I thought the animation was great and the story was developing into something more.Now, that the series it out (being at the 9 episode mark) I can understand why people hate this and people like this. On one end of the conversation people hate the loli thing going on, the terrible plot, and the generic, apathetic, and ""black haired"" MC. On the other end people say that their age is of a 4 year difference (will get to this later), and they do admit that some arcs may be a little shabby but the story line itself is nothing to frown at, and how the MC is actually not a generic character but a lot different.And I for one can tell that they put a lot more work than other animes into the characters.Now heres my opinion on the loli part: I honestly don't mind, just like I hate harems I can still find a way to actually see why the series is good. For me a 13 year old and a 17 year old SHOULD NOT BE DATING, but I do think that at the point of legal age its ok, like seriously whats the fret?Im keeping this review at a 3 star because I can see why people hate this and people like this, so if your thinking about watching this anime keep that in mind.",3
assassins-pride,"Putting aside that this anime has massive pacing issues, they don't bother developing the characters or the story at all, and there are massive plot holes— I just can't this show. I can't. Nine episodes of watching an older man take advantage of his position of power to practically groom this teenager to be his romantic interest. They play up how helpless and tiny and innocent she is, shove her into a corset, then fling her into a situation that just has me cringing and reminding myself that it's an anime and he's not a real pedophile. Nope. Nope nope nope.",4
assassins-pride,"I went into this show knowing it would be kind of bad but after episode 9 I just can’t watch anymore. I’m really over the sexualization of kids and no one batting an eye at what she said in ep.9. Also at this point in the show, I’m just like.. what?? Like the other reviews have said, the pacing really does throw it off. A lot happened in one episode yet it feels like they just threw the information out there just to get it out the way. They’re also really trying to make the two main characters a thing but it’s awkward and extremely cringe worthy. Maybe because she’s like 12 and he’s grown lol.. it doesn’t explain very well why he saved her in the first place, he just suddenly had a change of heart and gets super attached in one episode?? This show could’ve been great but it just missed the mark for me. The main guy is the only one I even slightly care about and the fight scenes are decent, but the characters need more development.",2
assassins-pride,"Animation: 8/10OP: 9/10Plot Potential: 9/10Plot Execution: -2,000,000/10Thus ends my review.In all seriousness: its pretty, and there is potential, but the main story seems to be taking a backseat to the side content. This review is posted as of episode seven. It is ridiculous how much of the main story is just not there at all, even as somebody who has not read the source, it is pretty obvious. Extremely hard to follow after 2 rewatches.",1
assassins-pride,"This show really seemed like it was going to grab me with some of the weird and interesting visuals that it was showing me in that first episode, but unfortunately it's all flash and no substance. Visually this show is fine. There are some neat battle sequences. The first time this show had some spooky jack-o-lantern headed monsters I felt like it was really pitching itself to me as a guy who likes halloween. Unfortunately, I should have seen those jack-o-lantern headed monsters for the big ol' red flags that they ended up being.Assassin's pride is a story about your standard edge-lord anime sad-boy protagonist. His character traits appear to be that he is an assassin, is the strongest sword-user possible, and is too cool to actually have any personality. He's been tasked with killing an incredibly depressed girl who doesn't have the magic combat buff abilities that everyone else in the show has. She's been being bullied by the kids at her magical battle school for not being super strong, but it's okay because she works really hard. Instead of killing he sees her being attacked by the jack-o-lantern monsters, who the show informs us are ""lycanthropes"" and he decides to save her and gift her with magic powers somehow. If you think about all of that for any amount of time, the big ""turn"" in episode 3 will come as no shock to you.It reminds me a lot of WorldEnd, where the world was beautiful but then I hated everyone in it, and I hated everything that was happening. While I wasn't filled with joy, I also didn't hate this show. It's just kind of middle of the road. Nothing it does is surprising or exciting. Three episodes in, it feels like the kind of show I would watch all of if I ended up staying home from work one day because I was sick.",3
assassins-pride,"The title really says it all. If you've been watching anime for the past 3-4 years you know exactly what a standard fantasy light novel looks like. This one is a bit unique in some ways, but overall it's all pretty hackneyed at this point.I'll spare you the story synopsis thus far, you can read that on your own. I guarantee you that none of it will fall terribly far from other ""magic school with a bunch of girls"" light novels. Not necessarily an issue if it's done decently, but there's an issue with ""decently"" already. One of my main issues at the moment is that, outside of how hackneyed it is, the main character just seems to do a 180 on his job and ENTIRE PERSONALITY. It's also difficult to tell who the protagonist is vs the deuteragonist, but that's not necessarily an issue.The title is also hilariously off because for being about an ""assassin's pride"", he sure as hell throws that away very quickly when he abandons his job...Many of the resolutions also feel a bit hollow, but you know that's pretty much standard fare at this point.So why am I giving this a 3/5 instead of like 2/5 or below? The presentation isn't bad, from some artistic standpoints. It's difficult to explain. It's mostly crap, but it's somehow presented decently. The opening is interesting in the way it meshes some of its effects. That's about it, really. It's one of those presents you're not terribly happy about receiving, but in a pretty box.",2
assassins-pride,"I can't really say that I am seeing a whole lot new or different with Assassins Pride. In many ways this is following most of the old tropes regarding some underdog character who works hard and pulls ahead - we've seen this before. However, I suppose it does serve as a good illustration when it comes to depicting the many examples in Japanese Power Fantasy Novels - both for men and for woman; extremely blatantly at that. The anime isn't trying to hide this and pretty well shows a lot of the highlights of what this genre of anime has become.IE, you shouldn't be looking at this anime other then for educative purposes.",4
assassins-pride,"Two words sum this entire show up fairly well.Butchered adaptation.Significant chunks of the source material were removed, most of which helped to increase the depth of the characters.  Moments that solidified their feelings or who they are as people? Skipped over entirely.The fight scenes are also merely OK.  If you've never read the source material you can get some minor enjoyment out of this series.  If you read the source material avoid this at all costs.",1
assassins-pride,"It's set in an alternate realty where a chosen few of the total populace are, simply put,  "" Born "" with a power that enhances their strength. TBH, It reminds me of the old TV show Dark Shadows. I know, its an old reference, but the point is that the atmosphere is bleak and kind of creepy, and the male lead is dark and mysterious. The show has a way of telling the story w/o needing to resort to over the top action, romance, or fan service. If I have a complaint, it would be it a little too melodramatic. Still, I think it's a great anime well worth watching.",4
assassins-pride,"https://imgur.com/a/I5slv07Episode 1 set expectations high. Some really stellar animation, great musical composition, interesting characters. Episode 2 was a little lower on quality, but to be expected. Most anime use majority of their animation budget on the first episode and the last few, come in and go out with a bang.Then episode 3 came. Episode 3 is absolutely disgusting. They colored the manga and put it into Microsoft Word and recorded it with bandicam circa 2006. Oh boy what wasted efforts.",2
assassins-pride,"The cover art caught my eye in the first couple of seconds which is exacty what an anime series needs, a good art style that is pleasing, Assassins Pride conveys this same principle in many ways, the first being obvious, the cover. However, the first episode was lacking in content, it ubruptly ending left people wanting more, which may seem bad, but its a double edged sword in this case. When SAO's first season ended, many people wanted more, however what we got was worse. Think of that, but in this case got better! They surprised me in the second episode, and now i cant wait for the fourth to release and so on. If you havent watched this, i recomend it, and i cant wait till they bring more to the table, especially with the great world, and lore, behind the characters.",1
assassins-pride,"In a post-apoc steampunk fantasy world...no, not Attack on Titan, the remnants of humanity live in what amounts to a giant chandelier (which looks like jolly old England on the inside.) Monsters dwell in the dark, beyond the reach of lanterns, threatening our existence. Anddddddddddddd, that's not the focus here. Instead, a professional assassin is hired to tutor the ""incompetent talented girl"" of a noble family who has yet to awaken her magical powers. If she doesn't manifest the abilities of her house, he has orders to kill her. And yet, upon seeing her spirit, he takes it upon himself to foster her growth and protect her, even at the risk to his own life. Chivarly, sword fighting, and familial intrigue abound in this victorian-style (love story?)",3
assassins-pride,"This is just me but im not the nit picking type and i dont like reading manga cause it spoils. but i like the main characters personality towards melida and how he splits his life up so perfectly between being a mentor, and his work life I know it has to be reassuring for melida since she has no doubts about him. I also cant wait to see how melida is when she grows more skilled and what her future is like.",3
assassins-pride,"What's this? Not an isekai?What's this? Plot?What's this? Not a free upskirt, a wholesome show?Actual character development and pacing in the first and second episode???Jokes aside, I do feel this is better than the rest of the anime's this season storytelling-wise, mind you I haven't seen many so take this with a grain of salt. After all these seasons of isekai, isekai, and more isekai, it's nice to have a simple fantasy setting to keep yourself from losing your sanity. I enjoyed the first two episodes enough to say this is a decent show to continue watching and would much rather read it's light novel (11 novels completed according to novel updates but not licensed yet so there's hope with this anime, also it's very well rated as a novel too). Supposedly they cut a lot of content between the manga and definitely the LN (I haven't read the manga because I would rather wait for the LN translation), but anime being anime, pacing is forgiven sometimes since they want to cram later story content as soon as possible. This isn't a masterpiece of a show but has enough good points to warrant watching the season.PS: Is that you kirito?... (⊙_⊙)",3
assassins-pride,"Not sure why but this show got a lot of mixed reviews based on the first episode. So far there is only 2 episodes out at the time of this review which is less than the 3 episode rule but we do have a clear direction of where the series is headed by the end of episode 2. The characters have not been fully developed but so far, the relationship between Melida and Nerva is an interesting one. In the first episode we see Nerva come off as a bully who does not care about Melida and only uses her to torment her and feel superior in a way. However, in the second episode during their fight and after we see a bond between them form when Nerva was the only one to reach out to Melida as her first friend even though she bullies her. After the fight in episode 2, Nerva also apologizes to Melida and basically acknowledges her as an equal after Melida beats her.Another interesting relationship is between Melida and her mentor, Kufa. Kufa has a hard time showing any emotion as he frequently tries to hide it (supposedly to be professional). But, he seems to actually care for Melida despite being all about his mission and ordered to assassinate her if she cannot use mana. He even reveals that if his plan fails then not only she will be killed, but he will as well for not killing her as ordered of him. Overall, there isn't much substance only there being two episodes but compared to other series' first two episodes, I am amazed at how interesting the characters are already and the plot seems good and very enjoyable to watch. I found the time to be flying by while watching the two episodes. I am interested to see how the relationships between Melida and her father and cousin turn out as those are also interesting to find out how they turn out.P.S. I may be a little biased because the plot is somewhat relatable to an anime called the Irregular at Magic High School of which I enjoyed and still wish for a season 2. However, Assassin's Pride, without the cliché high school aspect found in many anime, might make this anime even more unique and better than that anime (although I recommend you go see it if you like this anime so far).",1
assassins-pride,"This is sort of disappointing but then again, the plot was nothing to write home about to begin with. Good animation, good music, good voice acting, but absolute trash plot, which is why I'm dropping it. I don't blame the studio for the product they have offered, they made an effort to provide a quality product, I blame them for taking on this project. You can't make a filet-Mignon, when your base product is only suitable for dog meat.EDIT: If you think you need a 3 episode rule, that's fine. If I know something is trash after 1 episode, I don't then decide to follow it up with 2 more. Once I know it is bad I won't add more pain and suffering in my life, to suit your imaginary ""3 episode rule.""In case you need more info.

assassins-pride,"Assassin's Pride is a lushly romantic anime, set in a strange bottle world of darkness and lamplight. An assassin must either kill or cure a failing scion of a noble family, and helps her by sharing his magic with her. She must now become an all-conquering warrior in a world of intrigue, shadows and cloak-and-dagger. I'm surprised by how much I'm enjoying it. The heroine Melida Angel is surprisingly tough, and her tutor Kufa Vampir a true gent. It has an odd feel to it, rather like the desolate worlds of a Fumito Ueda game. Though I warn you the director spends a lot of time staring at girls' legs.",2
assassins-pride,"I came home from a standup comedy to this. I was in a good mood, then an art student's undergrad project ruined 25 minutes of my perfect night. The animation is CGI, all of it, even the 2D bits. I like it, it's nice, but the direction, oh God, no. The director wants to use silence for meaning and add drama, it's not working! It's silence, nothing happening, it's not dramatic, it is boring. The premise is stupid, ""if the girl doesn't have MANA her mom's a cheating ... So kill the girl."" Why? Just remove Melida from the will or disown her. Or is this a world where cops don't do work? Why risk going to jail over a cheating person WHO'S ALREADY DEAD? Also these monsters which she goes out to fight, allegedly by the Duke's request, can't kill her? In the episode it is implied she fights monsters on regular basis, ""the Duke pushes her,"" to force a manifestation of her mama. But then she needs statutory rapist to save her? Her tutor is a child molester, it's what we call adults who kiss middle school children on the mouth.So, let's summarize: Average CGI art, some music, lots of silent pauses because ""drama"", lolicon molesting kids, unrealistic premise, inconsistent plot, and no action so far. Nothing that happened is what I would call eye candy, or intriguing, the story has no flavor. And I like my romance legal. I'm not gonna say what should and shouldn't exist in art, but I can choose to critique it. I'm not even taking off a star for it, just a heads up. Two stars for the art and it had a cool setup for the world, but it has no meat on them bones!",3

Sadly, the show has no real humor to it. I've criticized Slime for not having enough humor, but Slime is a laugh-fest compared to Prodigies. There is no suspense and no challenge here, because the protagonists are overpowered and can easily handle any problems they face. The fantasy elements are weak. No explanations are given for the protagonists' superhuman skills, beyond being prodigies. We haven't seen a reason that they ended up in that world. There's no real plot in sight. The show is only good for wish fulfillment, spamming tropes, and a little fanservice here and there.Like Isekai Cheat Magician, this show only exists to cash in on the isekai popularity. There's no real effort put into the writing. Even the main characters are intentionally generic, and don't even use names.

I understand anime is a wonderful art form, one that means a lot to many. I don't understand why that means everything has to be super serious. All the negative reviews are missing out  on a ton of enjoyment by taking it too serious. It's an absurd story, with seriously OP characters, silly circumstances, and great humor that is derived from those things. I was smiling ear to ear after watching the first episode. Not every movie has to be The Scarlet Letter, and not every anime has to be Baccano! Just like a stupid funny movie like Ace Ventura has a place, so does this show.

You can tell this anime is a complete cringefest when it features a character with hetrochromia but I could not believe how bad this anime was. All the characters are incredibly overpowered, not even a fun way, with one of the ""prodigies"" being a reporter is able to take out two armed guards in a single blow. That is, in no way resembling her role, and puts Frank West to shame in combat ability (and he's covered wars you know). Also, the characters show little to no concern about being transported to another world with the exception of a magician, who can literally fly - and even then his greatest concern is seeing catgirls. This usually is passable, except the protagonist, is literally the prime minister of Japan. I love the potential of isekai, with many great series such as RE:Zero, and Konosuba existing, but there are so many cheap cash-ins such as this trash that make me wish it could be disposed off for good.In review, don't waste your time on this trash, and Crunchyroll, stop wasting money on cannon fouder shows like this and get some actual good shows.",5

Like some other reviewers mentioned, the protagonists would probably be decent in some sort of political near-real-world story, perhaps reminiscent of Lelouch of the Rebellion, but they're just boring here.

high-school-prodigies-have-it-easy-even-in-another-world,"This is a very disappointing anime series. As always, many Isekai series come out every year now; most are ""eh,"" while about two are incredible, and the rest are awful. High School Prodigies Have It Easy Even In Another World falls in the last category. As other reviewers have pointed out, the art is the only thing this series has going for it. But every other aspect of this anime is terrible. My chief complaint is that this series is just lazy story telling.There is no character development; all the main characters (MCs) have no reservations about who they are, and their respective relationships/roles in the fantasy world they find themselves in. They don't develop, and show no sign of growth. Instead, they come off as smug and privileged, while believing that they are always in the right.If you want to watch Isekai anime that has great stories, good art, and amazing character development I recommend the following:1. A Vision of Escaflowne2. Re:Zero: Starting Life In Another World3: Overlord4. Saga of Tonya The Evil5. Drifters6. No Game, No Life7. Problem Children are Coming from Another World, aren't they?Not all of these are available on Crunchy Roll, but you should be able to find them out their.If asked, I would say ""don't waste your time on High School Prodigies Have It Easy Even In Another World.Thank you for reading this review!",1

Am I supposed to be convinced the supposedly OP main characters just sat around for a whole month before they decided to jump on this new world bandwagon? What was the point of making this an isekai and then on top of that, also skipping a month into the story? I don't think I've ever been so unconvinced by an anime before... Maybe if the characters were at least sort of living up to their prodigy expectations, I would be somewhat convinced the story makes some reasonable sense, but now I'm questioning this more than I should for me to enjoy the story for what it is.",1

It really shows when all of the 7 are transported to the isekai world and they just brush it off like it's a regular occurrence. Not to mention that all of the 7 are completely overpowered which trivializes the entire show and makes any tension that could be in the show disappear completely.

Maybe you'll enjoy if for a while, but you know you're gaining nothing from it.This show doesn't even try to write a good story or to make sense. It knows exactly what it is, bottom of the barrel clearance aisle potato chips. The characters are entirely throw away and even the show itself doesn't bother using their actual names. Refering to them more often by their ""job"". Everyone is purely one dimensional and clearly no effort was made to make them anything else. The author may have intended the story to be a parody of isekai, but I doubt it, it feels much more like a high school fan fiction where they went back and changed the names of the characters so you ""don't know"" which actually good original content they're badly impersonating. Despite that, this show is indeed cheap junk food of anime - and even cheap junk food can be enjoyed at times. It's got fan service, occasionally good, if unintended humor and lots of terrible but fun to laugh at cliches. If you have nothing better to do, you can do worse than waste a few hours watching this.

high-school-prodigies-have-it-easy-even-in-another-world,"This show is not very good.World: The world is your very standard fantasy isekai world. Our heroes end up in a little nowhere village filled with beast people who are being oppressed because they're beast people. Because racism is bad, our heroes decide to help the beast people out. The villainous empire that is oppressing them starts out seeming like your regular fantasy noble evil, and then turns the dial up to 11 to achieve comically evil status by the end.The Story: Is also very standard and very average. Our heroes were all friends, and all masters of their craft, and now they've been pulled into a magical world. Our main guy is a politician, and if you don't enjoy his character you will most definitely not enjoy this show. They run into fantasy society problems that come up when the nobles are the kind of evil you see in fantasy settings, and then they correct them by not being terrible human beings. It's super good that they are there because apparently none of the residents of this magical world ever try to stand up for themselves. I guess revolutions of the populace is just a human world thing.Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideIt does take an unexpected turn when our heroes decide that the way to free the people is by forming a religion. Normally in a fantasy shows, we aren't shy about taking the stance that religions are bad, so it was interesting to see the heroes decide to make their own.In the end though, the story seems to get in a rush to get things done. They had a reveal in the last episode that a villain was still alive, and this shocked the heroes. I couldn't recall that character having died so I was genuinely confused. It felt like maybe something was supposed to have happened there and either I missed it because this show failed to hold my attention, or they had just forgotten to show me the thing that made it make sense. The Characters: This is where this show should do amazingly, but instead it falls flat. All of those characters look interesting, but that is all they are. The characters are papier-mâché effigies, they may look pretty, but it's all on the surface because they're hollow and empty. Maybe if this show hadn't had 7 main characters, or had more than a 12 episode run I would have felt differently, but without the names being written on that poster I would have been able to tell you the name of exactly one character in the show (and it's likely not who you think it is).They try to dig into the politician character when they realize that they need to try and focus on something, but he is exactly what he looks like, an anime sad boy with white hair and a dark past. It's a real shame because the glimpses we get into the lives of all of the other characters are so much more interesting than blandy-man politician. Ringo (The character who's name was the one I remembered) actually does have an episode that explores her past, but once you look at it and what we learn about blandy-man it seems like the writer only writes one kind of origin story. Based on that, I probably wouldn't have been sucked in by any of the other characters had we actually explored their origins more completely.Final Thoughts: I picked up the localized manga when it came out, because my comic-book store clerk knows that I enjoy reading a lot of dumb isekai plot lines. I got about 6 pages in to that book before putting it down and accepting that it was not for me. When I saw the anime I figured I'd give it another shot. I was able to get through all 12 episodes, but it still had all the same problems that those first 6 pages did.Because there are so many characters in this show, it makes it feel like there is too much going on to keep track of. Unfortunately a lot of what is going on doesn't really have much weight. Things ramp up at the end and some crazy stuff happens, but it just feels like stuff is happening and not for any real reason. The villains seem to be evil for the sake of being evil.For a more manageable version of this kind of story I would suggest  Problem Children Are Coming From Another World. It may be two episodes shorter, but it also has less than half of this bloated main cast.",1
high-school-prodigies-have-it-easy-even-in-another-world,"So, I’ve been watching this pretty much all season, and I have some thoughts. This anime is more or less your average isekai with overpowered characters (seven of them in this case) that trivialize any threat or challenge that comes their way. If you don’t  like that in an anime or can’t tolerate it to some extent, then this isn’t your anime. Straight up. This isn’t a good isekai anime. Go off and look up some good ones like Log Horizon and Overlord or something. However, if you can tolerate the mediocrity of the premise, then you’re in for a kind of weird and wild ride. I say this because this show tackles some really dark subject matter, and I’m not sure if they intended it to come across as serious or if it was meant for shock value, but it definitely comes across as shock value. Below, I’m going to go into some detail about what the dark subject matter IS so if you don’t want spoilers, avoid this section. Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideSo, there’s some lobotomy in the most recent episode that I’ve watched, and one of the main characters did it. There’s also cannibalism, fire zombies, murder, sexual assault, and a nuke that I imagine the main characters will use at some point. There’s some really strange stuff here. It’s fascinating in a sort of macabre way. The dark subject matter doesn’t make this anime really worth watching in my opinion, but it’s one of the few things keeping my attention if only for the macabre nature of it.",1
high-school-prodigies-have-it-easy-even-in-another-world,"Let me start with saying, I am absolutely isekai trash and am totally going to finish this.

If you get that far, you'll know why. Sometimes it doesn't even make sense how OP these ""prodigies"" are. At some point I can't tell if it's a parody like Cautious Hero or Konosuba, or if it's just really that bad and contrived. Either way it's mildly entertaining.

I wonder if Yanagi simply realized that the show he was tasked with making would be trash, so he tried to give it a soundtrack that wouldn't be similarly trash.I'm sorry, Yanagi.  You did the best you could with this dumpster fire.  All of the humor that is attempted falls flat, the music score sounds like it was taken from a pile of stock mp3s that the producer forced on the director, and the way each ""conflict"" is handled is wildly melodramatic.Every part of this show, from the visual design to the storyboarding indicates that a whole hell of alot of money was spent, yet compromises were made around every corner.",1
high-school-prodigies-have-it-easy-even-in-another-world,"This is seriously terrible.I honestly can't stomach to watch more than an episode, let alone the entire series. I have a few reasons as to why it's really bad, even though I don't think people would care about my opinion or even care to watch more than five minutes.The story is absolutely tragic. These seven young prodigies are thrust into another world after a plane crash in which all seven of the high schoolers survived the horrific crash. No word on the pilots though. When the main character wakes up to find himself in a bed with a bandage on his head, he suddenly remembers that he shouldn't be alive right now and immediately shows us a flashback. As the scene goes on, a girl who clearly has elongated ears walks into the room wearing fantasy style clothing, he is completely unaware of his surroundings. Absolutely does not question it one bit. That is - until the woman with the tail and ears walks into the room after a extremely weird fan service moment in which the elf girl chews up a bit of meat and feeds the main character like a bird.The characters are awful. One is a ninja journalist, an old-style female samurai, a entrepreneur that somehow has a hand in 30% of all trades in the world (Or Japan, can't remember) - a loli who is a great inventor, the main character is somehow the prime minister of Japan while still being in high school. The rest are extremely forgettable apparently.Honestly this show is a clear case of a corporation making an anime just to make a quick buck. I looked up this anime to find the author, I don't know who Riku Misora is nor do I care, if this anime is true to the manga, he needs to find another job.Really feels like Happinet told the author to email over a page loosely explaining the plot and manga style, then outsourcing it to an animation studio, allowing them to flex their animation skills despite the garbage story.I will also complain about the main characters eyes. I can't stand characters that look like that.There is a silver lining though. I found out what Isekai was because of this anime, and the animation is very beautiful. A pity.",1

high-school-prodigies-have-it-easy-even-in-another-world,"I've been interested since episode one!

high-school-prodigies-have-it-easy-even-in-another-world,"Most would probably give this series a hard time due to how our main characters are mary sues from the get-go; in fact, quite a few people already have.  True, that does make for a rather uninteresting series when it relies on narrative tension and external conflict to draw in its viewers, however, there exists multiple series that prove that this isn't an inherently bad thing.  While I haven't watched it, One-Punch Man has gone on to critical acclaim, for example.  While I haven't heard of them, I'm sure there are numerous other series proving this as well.  A show's quality is dependent on its execution, not its premise.A shame, then, because the execution is lacking at best.  I don’t want to be too harsh on this show, because it does get better after episode 4, but that’s past the point most would have dropped it.  That said, I can still find traces of its initial problems in the later episodes.If the show wasn't going to build itself on external conflict, it should have built itself on internal conflict.  It should have focused on the dynamics between these characters, their reactions to getting thrust into another world, their feelings towards each other.  For instance, Akatsuki is the world's greatest magician (Read, illusionist), and Shinobu is the world's greatest journalist and ninja.  There could have been a bit of a rivalry between these two because she keeps seeing through his illusions.  It would have led to an interesting character dynamic.  Outside of accomplishing a goal, however, they hardly even acknowledge each other’s existence.  I don’t even think they’ve spoken one word to each other.  Instead, the only two characters who have a more complicated dynamic then ‘we’re in this together’ are Ringo and Tsukasa, which we’ll get to later.They also could have done a thing where, after defeating a giant monster, Aoi's sword breaks.  It would have served to remind them - and by extension us - that despite this girl being an extraordinary swordswoman, her sword is extra ordinary.  Or at least it is until Ringo makes a better one.They bring up the fact that the plane they arrived in had an experimental nuclear core powering it; with this, I have two ideas.  The first idea is that the more hot-headed and confrontational members of the group assume Ringo is responsible for them being trapped in the new world, which could lead to an interesting internal conflict until Tsukasa finally convinces them they were summoned by that world's god.  The second idea is to have the reactor threaten to melt-down occasionally, forcing Ringo to manually fix it, slowing her progress until she can find a more permanent solution.  Once again, she might be extraordinary, but her materials and tools aren't.  She’s also just relegated to building stuff offscreen for the group, which is a shame because the writer could have had her MacGyver her way out of most situations.Going back to Akatsuki for a minute, the idea of an illusionist getting trapped in a world with actual magic is nothing new, and it can be used for great effect.  Just look at Oz: The Great and Powerful.  However, they never explain how he does his tricks, and they make them over the top impossible and expecting you to believe it because 'He's the world's best magician.' Yeah, sorry, but they're called 'magic tricks' because they trick people into thinking their magic when they're really just sleight of hand and misdirection.  Masato managed to conquer an entire monopoly with a basic revenue-sharing model, so you have to wonder why this show wouldn’t include at least one scene of a smoke machine.Speaking of Masato, in the third episode, the show tries to establish Masato is a really kind and stand-up guy when he helps a girl get out of slavery and takes her on as his apprentice.  But it unironically undercuts it by not only having him pay the slavers in full, but also by paying them a hundred times what she's worth, ensuring that not only can that business continue, but thrive.  If anyone listened to what people said about Master of Ragnarok, they clearly took the wrong message.  A scene that establishes what they wanted better is when he managed to crush a monopoly, only to let the company continue to exist as he thought a monopoly, no matter who ran it, was a bad thing.  While I agree with that mentality, I don’t think it’s going to last long.  After he so thoroughly destroyed the other company’s revenue and trust, I highly doubt it’s going to last long now that Masato’s in town whether he likes it or not.  That would have been interesting to explore, the idea that he’s too good for his own good and can’t keep any competition around because of it, but if the show did that, I wouldn’t be suggesting it, now would I?Also, I don’t care how smart the guy is, a bog-standard revenue sharing plan should not have allowed him to topple a monopoly.  His competition should have been putting him through hell.  Just look at how Big Oil sabotaged their competition before we decided monopolies were bad things.  Masato didn’t succeed because he was competent, he succeeded because his competition was incompetent.The biggest crime here, however, is that these characters have no character.  As previously stated, there are seven prodigies, however there only seems to be enough personally for one, so they kinda have to share.  They're just a specialization meant to help move the plot along.  They're plot devices at best.  That would be acceptable if they were side-characters, but this is the main group we're talking about here.  While I haven't watched it, One-Punch Man most likely worked because it focused on the character, not the struggle.  Here though, not only is there no struggle, but there also isn’t character.  Akatsuki seems to have the most personality of the group, but it isn’t much.  There’s a brief moment in episode 4 where Akatsuki was taken aback by all the bloodshed his group was causing and froze up for a minute, but like I said, it’s a brief moment.  He’s also the most shaken by waking up in another world, but for the wrong reason.  He’s more afraid of how everyone has anime tails and ears than anything else.  This would have been funny if they pointed out how stupid he was, but they don’t.    Even if he was the best character, 1/7 is still a failing grade.Actually, I tell a lie, Keine also has a noteworthy personality, but only in the sense that it’s utterly abhorrent.  Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideShe’s a complete psychopath who’s willing to lobotomize her enemies at a moment’s notice and suggestions that Rinko rapes Tsukasa to ‘get closer to him.’  I get that Comedic Sociopath is a common thing that can be done very well, but the problem is that she’s exceptionally good at hiding it.  There are never any moments where people call her out for how morally bankrupt she is, and she only suggests something immoral when it’s a bridge too far once.  Ironically, despite hating god for making humans so frail, she’s the type of person who proves that there is no god.For the most part, these characters just move from one plot point to the next without any sort of meaningful interaction with pretty much anyone.Having said that, the show doesn’t fair all too well when it focuses on specific characters.  Episode ten reveals why Ringo has a crush on Tsukasa, and boy is it poorly written:  Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideWhen they were still in high school, Tsukasa kept bringing her things to fix.  When she decided she wanted to focus on her own inventions instead of repairing, she discovered he was bringing her those things from some sort of shop or something without telling her.  For some reason, this gets her to fall for him becasue he was always nice to her about it and even took her declining to fix things with a smile.  Maybe it's just my cynical perspective on things, but it looked more like he was taking advantage of her kindness and talents to make a profit.  Given how Ringo’s mother abandoned her due to the girl being too smart and accomplished for her liking, you’d think Ringo would be more offended than she is flattered.Another big problem is that it seems to be taking itself way too seriously.  You have a group of kids who are all the absolute best examples of their profession, not just for their age, but for their world, transported to a fantasy world.  This should be an absurdist comedy of sorts.  Have Ringo create a fully functional recreation of the Iron Man armor in a cave with a paperclip and some soda cans.  Have Aoi fight off a giant monster with a toy sword.  Have Keine cure cancer or even death.  If you’re going to make the story this easy for them, you could at least have fun with it.  Instead, it's trying to weave some grand tale about these kids changing an entire world, and it's trying to do so seriously – or at least as seriously as an anime can get.But like I said, it did get better after episode 4.  When the actual plot got started, I found I had an easier time watching these episodes.  It’s an okay enough show, but that’s all it is.",1
high-school-prodigies-have-it-easy-even-in-another-world,"Don't really know why some people have given 1 star review to the show, personally I found quite interesting and entertaining. The characters are lovable and the plot is quite unique, at times it might feel that the characters are overpowered (at least academically) but it's part of the premise of the story so I didn't really pay no attention to that and instead focused on the story itself so all and all I would say watch it and judge by yourself, I believe you will enjoy it.",1
high-school-prodigies-have-it-easy-even-in-another-world,"This anime is if you started a Civ game on easy and went directly for the Giant Death Robots. These high-schoolers just build god damn rail guns and missiles and they're fighting against soldiers with swords and shields. That doesn't mean its a bad anime. In fact, I find it very entertaining. Just watch it for what it is and don't go into it expecting the next masterpiece.Story 3/5: The premise is a pretty generic isekai with some kind of twist. Basically take Danganronpa but instead of them being locked in a school, they're in an Isekai. You have the leader, the business man, the samurai, the ninja, the doctor, the wizard, the techy and throw in an elf for good measure. They get transported mysteriously into this fantasy world and have to find a way back home. While they're there, they overthrow a local noble and start bringing on the democracy, AMERICA-STYLE. Armed with their rail guns and missile defense systems, they begin a revolution to overthrow the feudal society. The plot is stupid, but the anime embraces the stupidity to make it at least entertaining. Characters 2/5: No character is developed particularly well except for maybe the leader, Mikogami Tsukasa who currently is the only one who has a legitimate backstory as to why he became ""The Politician"". Character tropes are pretty standard and none of them are particularly well refined but they're ok I guess. The issue with the character development though is similar to what happened in the Slime Isekai. There is no challenge for the characters. The lack of challenge makes character development hard to build because there's nothing pushing them to be better. They are already so overpowered that there is no character complexity, or inner turmoil, or drama. Everything goes hunky dory and that leaves the characters relatively 2 dimensional.Art/Animation 3/5: Decent art and animation. Character designs are pretty standard but are animated well enough. The magic is pretty well animated and the battles are done pretty well. There is a bit of clunkiness with the CG, especially for the higher tech weapons they use but it's not that bad.Sound 3/5: Intro song is very skippable. No soundtrack really stood out to me, but it wasn't exactly bad. It fit the situations well but none of them really had that majestic amazing sound like its really building to something amazing. The upbeat opening fits the silliness of the anime. Ending song is pretty nice. Entertainment 4/5: I literally burst into laughter as I was writing this review. It's so stupid, but its so fun also. Like there's nothing wrong with playing Civ on easy mode. It's fun to just roll out giant death robots and wreck everyone. Plus we got a hot elf girl. Minus points for the ugly bastard in episode 4. Like why does this even exist in anime. Who likes watching that? I don't need to see that Pot of Greed face in anything outside of a Yu-Gi-Oh card. Overall 3/5: It's worth the watch if you want to watch something that you don't really have to care about. You don't really need to think when watching this anime. It's just entertainment. Also, don't take it too seriously. At one point the samurai girl manually guides a missile onto a target. They're not making Casablanca.",5
high-school-prodigies-have-it-easy-even-in-another-world,"Could have been more interesting if it wasn't trying to subvert, included, and exceed all existing tropes at once.Too many supposed ""main"" characters prevent adequate for them all even the one that is supposed to be the protagonist among the main characters leaving even less room for the also too large cast of secondary and other supporting characters.Most of the problems with the show overall stem from this single issue. I'd rather a only a couple or even a single super-genius combat trained protagonist as the central focus than trying to play them all up.Could say more but I'm already past beating a dead horse for only one issue I have with it.",3
high-school-prodigies-have-it-easy-even-in-another-world,"TL:DR - OK filler but not for those with high standards.This review is being offered by someone who has only recently gotten back into watching anime after 4-5 years, and has watched up to the expected half-way point of the season.Overall the animation is good, VA is better than some others, and the concept of ""drag a medieval society into the Information Age"" is one that could be done well...but not so much here. Dr Stone is a better example of the concept from a different set of starting conditions which make it hard to truly compare.The world and lore itself has promise, but hard to tell when looking through the lens of the show as it stands.As many of the reviews point out, the characters are the weak point. While there is some development by Ep7, the ""All Teen All l337"" lineup of 7...SEVEN!!! main characters doesn't work that well.Too many things are hand-waved as ""Oh this genius did all this offscreen"" which is not satisfying. And really there is 1 main character slot and 4 true supporting character slots that get filled each episode.If it was me, I'd have one or two people dropped into the world, let things play out, and have others summoned in over the course of the first 6 episodes, with a more age diverse and not so OP cast...but that would defeat the premise of this show.",3
high-school-prodigies-have-it-easy-even-in-another-world,"It's interesting how we get to see each of the 7 mc's POVs and not just stuck to one or two of them. We do indeed see more of Mr.Prez than the others but it's not exclusively his POV. Like when we got to see Mr. Merchant in action in ep2-3,  Lil' Magician Spoiler Alert! Click to show or hideduring the battle at the castle in ep4  and Ms.Ninja popping up here and there...like a ninja. XD I like to see different angles to the same story, to me, it's more fun that way.",5
high-school-prodigies-have-it-easy-even-in-another-world,I've only gotten through 2 episodes of this show and I gotta say this show is lame for the same reasons that pretty much everyone else listed. The show has pretty much no substance as it's just people who were already on top of the world are teleported to a different world where they continue to be on top throughout without putting in very much effort at all. It takes away everything that makes a show good. With no real struggle or set goal in mind the show just feels lazy as everyone just does whatever they want and it works out as well as it can get because the show sets it up to be that way.,5
high-school-prodigies-have-it-easy-even-in-another-world,"this isn't the absolute worst but by no means is it any good. it's better than the other isekais available on crunchyroll this year (wise man's grandchild, isekai cheat magician) but still manages to be boring and one note. MCs are all completely OP from the get-go, no power training arc or character development or progression. they dont get powers from a god or anything, they were just already super high-spec before even coming to the new world. also, what's the deal with their obsession with mayonnaise? these medieval peasants act like eating mayo is a near orgasmic experience and after one taste they abandon all previously held beliefs and (literally) convert to the religion that offers them free sandwich spread.",1
high-school-prodigies-have-it-easy-even-in-another-world,"The story seems to have been written by a 14-year old that just realized what affection is, it's so over the top sexualized even for an isekai, I mean 7ish minutes into the first episode and the main protagonist is already french kissing an anime girl with double-deck bus-sized chest and he doesn't even seem surprised, that's just 1 of the many things the show gets wrong in just the opening sequence.",2
high-school-prodigies-have-it-easy-even-in-another-world,"I'm sorry Doctor green-hair, but your show is dead, Jim. The only character whose name I know is not his actual name, unless his parents hated him, (""merchant"" for those wondering). They should have had a few less high school prodigies go to this world, because I feel like all of them are paper cutouts that would shred if the slightest breeze came by.I gave the show a chance, but ep 5 was just too dumb, I would need to lobotomize my self to keep watching this show at this point. I mean did they copy the character model of the elf for Dr. Green-hair? I'm the opposite of religious and even I found this episode reductive and idiotic on the topic. And the more a Japanese prime minister who is a child talks about liberty and freedom for all types of people, the more I choke on things I'm eating and drinking from the irony. Oh and the reaction of the little magician kid about finding out there was real magic in Ep1 was ridiculous, because apparently fake show-magic is stronger and more impressive then REAL magic. It would be different if his character was fleshed out even for a minute or two, like explaining that a bunch of his equipment was in the plane crash or that genius girl created cloaky drones for him to use, anything. At least give us a flipping hand-wave.I'm a doctor, not a miracle worker. This show is not worth the time.",1
high-school-prodigies-have-it-easy-even-in-another-world,"I gave this show 3.5 episodes before I got so bored with it that I dropped it. Any problem the MCs, who are all just superhuman at their respective fields even though they're only high school students, ran in to was resolved so laughably easily that there was no dramatic tension.Even worse than that, it just wasn't interesting. I'll watch a show with a trash plot if it's fun, but this just failed to deliver its premise in a way I found enjoyable or interesting. I think I actually would prefer to watch In Another World with my Smartphone again, and that one had a boringly-OP main character as well.",2
high-school-prodigies-have-it-easy-even-in-another-world,"3⭐️- Watching the first episode it's your usual op isekai but they're actually prodigies from earth which is good because the whole isekai genre was all about powers from no explanation. Seven high school geniuses in an isekai world would be interesting as each of them and their skills will help the world around them to evolve and advance thanks to their  superior intelligence in a certain field.For the least part it's got seven unique characters with completely different abilities however the fact that in episode 1 tech girl has a portable nuclear reactor, it's going a bit too fast.Promising but expect nothing less of your average isekai4⭐️- EDIT1: ok so after watching the second episode i can sense that its not based around op magic power and yes, i know that in ep1 they mentioned people and magic and stuff. Besides if they were to have like a real fight i can just see the ninja girl being a fighter, the tech girl makes like weapons and stuff, journalist girl gathers intel or something, etc. They all are experts in their own field and I'm surprised seeing an isekai where they haven't go all out on the magic ) in ep2. Looks like they tried to create a isekai that isn't solely power-magic-orientated, and by filling that hole with intelligence is a good approachNice work",1
high-school-prodigies-have-it-easy-even-in-another-world,"1st episode is mostly omg staaaaahp. But its actually kind of funny, even with how typical it is. second episode picks it up and we get into money making, which i really enjoyed and hope they capitalize on actually going into forming a capitalist economy. if they focus on politics mostly i think it will be interesting and kind of fresh.Only 2 episodes out so far. IMO finish the second ep, if you dont like it you wont like it later either is my guess.",1
high-school-prodigies-have-it-easy-even-in-another-world,"The opening of the 1st episode was kinda weird for me. I didn’t like how they introduced all of the characters in one go. But after the first half of it, it appealed to me. There was progression. I just hoped that they didn’t have tools that they needed. The second episode was better though. It shows a bit of the merchants character but not too much (he’s cool as well). This genre was quite overused for me but the concept is really good. Can’t wait for the next episodes.",1
high-school-prodigies-have-it-easy-even-in-another-world,"Honestly, people see one episode of a series and they write it off as unoriginal...but you literally can't have an original beginning to a story now since pretty much everything's been done already (unless you're one of the MCs in this show that is). It's not gold, for sure, but it's OK. Worth watching if you have nothing better to do. The characters are overpowered but they aren't mary sues (they are just really good at one particular thing and OK at everything else, at least in concept). It's entertaining if not very deep.",1
high-school-prodigies-have-it-easy-even-in-another-world,"Edit: Two episodes in I think they may have a decent pace going on. I won't drop it because I know some of what happens, but I fear that many will. The isekai market is saturated and this series is definitely peak OP isekai. The animation and the vosice cast do a great job though.I was reading this manga for a while and I might go back to it. It's basically peak OP isekai. All of the characters are amazing at their specialty. When they go to the other world, they maintain their abilities and have the added bonus of having access to OP tech, because of how they enter the world. They don't do the standard ""learn to use our powers"" thing, because there is no need. If you want that sorry, it's not for you.If this follows the manga, you can look forward to character building in the form of interpersonal relationships and intrapersonal conflicts. The politician has some quirks I found interesting and I saw them becoming major issues and drivers of plot. Add in what seems like it might become a pretty messy love polygon and it could make for something interesting. The one thing that will definitely hurt this series, though, is if they take it at the same pace as the source material. The reason I stopped reading was to let it continue out some more, because the chapters could draaaaaaag. These are initial thoughts. I will amend after I watch the first episode.",3
high-school-prodigies-have-it-easy-even-in-another-world,"You know how you know when an anime is going to be bad? When the characters are so OP that they can solve any and all problems with no difficulty whatsoever. It's even worse when their abilities aren't remotely believable. I don't think I have to watch to already be able to tell how this anime is going to go.You want my advice? Skip this anime and go watch Re:Zero, The Sage of Tanya the Evil, Overlord, KonoSuba, or Rise of the Shield Hero.",3
high-school-prodigies-have-it-easy-even-in-another-world,"The entire show is ridiculous. I like Isekai anime but the whole premise is atrocious. This is wish fulfillment for Japanese fans, who can somehow believe that the 7 best of anything are all Japanese. Did Shizo Abe write this tripe? Ultra Nationalistic garbage for the new generation of Japanese Nationalist Otaku. Oh we should all be so grateful that the Messiahs from Japan will save the world.I'm rather disappointed that Crunchyroll  paid for the rights to distribute this trash world wide.",1
high-school-prodigies-have-it-easy-even-in-another-world,"There is apparently no shortage of demand for anime featuring people going to another world and being incredibly gifted there. It is wish fulfillment anime. And yet, with the number of incredibly similar stories season after season, it's clear that there must be tremendous demand for it... or we wouldn't be so inundated with it. That disturbs me on multiple levels.Even more disturbing is that there are better anime series being released with less production values than this pablum. If you want to watch people skip through life in another world being the best and the brightest, while surrounded by busty fantasy girls, by all means go ahead.",1
high-school-prodigies-have-it-easy-even-in-another-world,"EDIT My initial impressions after episode 1 were spot on. And the guess that they'll need an army by the end of the month was true. At least the master merchant is throwing every FTC violation in the book at the locals. Meanwhile miss Master surgeon ""repairs organs"" and restarts a heart before brain death. That's less than 5 minutes by the way. The victim had a pierced colon too, treated without any antibiotics! Amazing! Look, if you don't know anything about the real world, maybe you can make it through an episode, I could barely contain myself after the aluminum shovels. You know those crappy snow shovels which bend on packed snow? That's what the master engineer made for the villagers to dig dirt with. ""But dhristo! They are aluminum alloy!"" Yes, so are those cheap ones, aluminum sucks for shovels! As the master diplomat asks her, ""you are refining aluminum already?"" YOU HAVE A 737 WORTH OF ALUMINUM AND OTHER EXOTIC METALS ALREADY! Why does she need to refine ANY, just melt it down and forge? She should be forging guns by now... But I guess you don't need them since samurai lady can carry 4 ton boulders above her head bare handed. She can simply shot put like a cannon, grape shot will be a challenge, but I think she'll manage. This writer has done no research, doesn't care if anything is even close to realistic, and this makes the characters seem stupid while simultaneously succeeding at Herculean tasks. Master diplomat has already let everyone create political gaffes all over the place. Master surgeon is literally a goddess who doesn't need sanitary conditions or antibiotics to cure. Master scientist doesn't know how to reforge or recycle aluminum from a jetliner, and made shovels out of aluminum not steel. Master businessman is committing fraud. And the intelligence ninja didn't know an elite armored battalion was moving on the village. Who is the prodigy? It seems the writer simply writes in the cool stuff and then a bad thing for ""drama"". I'm kind of invested now, but if you aren't, better give this a pass. I'm taking back my mercy star. This is trash.Initial impressions bellow--------------------------------------------------------------------------This is an episode one review, so the show is given leniency the other reviews have shrugged away from. I like the ""isekai"" format more than the pure fantasy or alternate history formats. It usually has more expansive answer to ""what if...?"" Like in Overlord, ""what if you were stranded in a world full of NPCs (the humans) you cared little for?"" Pretty lonely existence for Ains, isn't it? Or in How not to Summon a Demon Lord, ""what if you were in another world without any social skills?"" Yeah, Diablo gets to do some pretty pervy things, but he's constantly under huge pressure. If you were even a little socially awkward, you do feel for the guy. In Tanya the Evil we get an office worker to not only fight a war, but also an entity with near limitless power. Can't be a fun time, even with Tanya's extra oomph. So, what does this anime offer? It's a group of 7, so they're not lonely. They are all exceptionally outgoing, so they aren't socially awkward. There is no war that they have to fight, there may be a war, but they aren't forced into it. There isn't a God pestering them, and they weren't summoned by some king to fight some sort of wave. There is a bad dragon, but that can't be too bad of an enemy if the story teller got laughed at.Oh, there's a nuclear reactor at their disposal. You get me one of those and dirt, I'll give you guns in a week, m777 howitzers without the electronics in a month, with the electronics in 6-7 months, and I'm just an engineer who hasn't built his own space lab. I'd be building main battle tanks in a year, tops. Who's gonna stop me? Oh, they do have the engineer in the pink dress on the cover. She better build a furnace and a lathe within the week or I'm calling Dr. Stone to ridicule her back into orbit.They had the master politician create a national incident and attempt to cover it up, poorly, on his very first encounter with a corrupt soldier. Something tells me he's not gonna do well unless engineer girl manages to procure him the equivalent of the USA armed forces by next month. So he better get to recruiting, I hope the master merchant can get him the budget he'd need for salaries, or the master magician Prince will have to pull them out of his...hat? What's an illusionist doing here? They couldn't fit in a physicist? Does the science girl do everything? Math, physics, engineering, biology, chemistry...? OK, I get it, prodigy, Dr. Stone does it, so why not? I don't like Dr. Stone either, arrogant p.... Anyway.This show has no appealing characters. We have overpowered people, who by all accounts were simply born that way, start trouble in another world. I don't know where the other reviewers got, ""we'll take your women, because we're better"" or ""elitism"" from, but I get the dislike of the characters. They are Mary Sues and quite annoying, especially ninja and samurai girls. I get taking out 2 guys each without armor, but four fully armored soldiers going down without a sound of struggle or hits, is too much. I get it, they are OP, but how do you knock out someone in a full helmet without making noise? Come on show! I'm not asking for reality, but at least enough for me to suspend disbelief ? A little bit? 90 pound girls taking down trained veterans, cool, I'll buy it, make the armor ding a bit? Bop? No? Nothing? OK, bye bye silly show.",1
high-school-prodigies-have-it-easy-even-in-another-world,"Could be interesting take on the tad overcrowded Isekai genre, a group of seven prodigies instead of the sole protagonist. Based on first episode it is okay, doesn't seem to take any risks with our super genius High Schoolers thrust into a medieval fantasy world. I'm hoping there will some interesting plot twists and some badly needed characterization (as it stands our Heroes are walking caricatures). It reminds ""Astra Lost in Space"", except this anime give the impression of being a lot more shallow. For what it is, it's fine, a nice way to wile away 24 minutes without much conflict or 'easy' viewing.",1

They were able to setup what they needed. Also keep in mind this is a work of fiction and fantasy, so things can be whatever the author write. It seem to me people are disliking this story was because of the absurd profession these kids are at a young age. I agree, however even irl thing like this can still happen; for example, the recent 9 years old electrical engineer graduate!
