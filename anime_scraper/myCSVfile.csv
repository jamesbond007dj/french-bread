It is Here! This is the future of the Shonen genre. The bringer of the next generation. The creator of Naruto even promoted the series and said it was the real deal. It takes a profound and unique spin on the genre and has solid characters, an intriguing story and a fantastic soundtrack. Studio Bones is doing an excellent job with the adaptation as well. As a manga reader I'm very much looking ...
SHORT VERSION: This is one of the most thrilling and delightful anime of its era. It's even healthy for your brain. Just watch it.Some shows are solid but dull; some shows are enjoyable but unsubstantial. This series is solid enough but manages to be one of the most energetic, enjoyable viewing experiences I've ever had. I would not consider it the best anime ever made, but I ...
Had you ever found your favorite anime was ended because they didn't make enough rating or out of budget? This is the one i'm actually hoping for that not to happen. I'd buy the whole company and the writer to make this to the last episode, non-stop. Soundtrack was very entertaining and really spot on with the main theme. Character developing quite slow, but then when its reach the momentum, it ...

If you are decided to watch this anime the best advice I can give you is to give it 5 episodes. Once you get to episode 5 I can promise you will either love it or hate it. I love it. A unique animation, emotional, funny, fantastical! If you enjoyed that one movie Hero High, please, please watch 5 episodes.
Ok so I kept saying I wouldn't watch this show because I wasn't crazy about the animation.....but...finally after everyone wouldn't shut up about it, I decided to give it a go. I was hooked by episode one, of course. Just like famous anime protagonists Naruto, Gon, etc., Midoriya is a character that you just can't help but fall in love with. The other characters are developing well too and the ...
I was browsing C.R. for kicks and I saw this one and figured, okay, I'll give it a shot. I had heard zero about the manga and zero about the show, so this was a fresh new world to delve into. Three days in and I finished up season 2 ep 21 and I'm eager for more. Easy binge and easy to get hooked on. Good storytelling and characters that are likeable. There's nothing about this show I don't like. ...
First off: WARNING! This show is slow to start to build momentum, mostly for character development and growth. I loved all the characters, even tho there is "one" main character, each one makes u want to figure out how they tick and there back story! Cannot wait for season 2!
If "X-men" and "Sky High" had a Japanese love-child, this would be it. With high schools for teens with superpowers called "quirks" training to become heroes and fight bad dudes.If you like:- Goofy characters- Fun, typical, cheezy storyline- BADASS fight scenes- A nerdy main character who cries a LOT but fights like a BEAST- and UNITED STATES OF SMASH!Then you'll love this ...
My Hero Academia is probably one of my favorite anime shows of all time. It has everything; emotion, humor, splendid action, great characters, awesome music and so on. It's very well animated, it can actually be very emotional, and the fight scenes are excellent. Give it a watch, you won't be disappointed.
